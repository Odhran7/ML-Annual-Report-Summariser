strategy and priorities 

nearly all organizations today find themselves at the convergence of two significant trends the evolution of applications as the center of their businesses and their customers’ digital lives and the escalation of threats against those applications this presents a tremendous challenge as many companies now manage complex application portfolios comprising older legacy and newer modern technologies and infrastructures in our 2022 state of application strategy report 88 percent of organizations said they operate both legacy and modern application architectures and 70 percent operate in multiple clouds these hybrid 

environments create operational complexity and expand the threat surface area as companies are forced to deploy separate and often inconsistent security controls across different environments 

over the past several years f5 has transformed its business and significantly expanded its software and cloud offerings to deliver a broad portfolio of solutions to help customers address the complexity and risk in today’s hybrid it environments through bigip f5 nginx and f5 distributed cloud services f5 offers a range of integrated machine learningdriven solutions that protect legacy and modern applications and apis across data center cloud and edge locations

we are maintaining our efforts to drive momentum of our brand and reputation to deliver clarity guidance and inspiration among our existing customers future customers partners and employees around our evolving strategy behind f5’s unique offering additionally to best support our growth as we transform our role in driving value for our customers we are transforming marketing from a cost center to a revenue center to serve as a meaningful and predictable source of opportunities customer growth and revenues the critical success factors in this shift are increased investments in digital technologies deep focus on the customer experience at every touchpoint and shifting our culture to adopt an agile mindset as we use data to constantly improve our contributions to our customers and ultimately our shareholders 

manufacturing 

we outsource the manufacturing of our preconfigured hardware platforms to a thirdparty contract manufacturer flex ltd flex for building assembling and testing according to our specifications at flexs facilities in guadalajara mexico and zhuhai china flex also performs the following activities on our behalf material procurement pcb assembly and test final assembly system test quality control and direct shipment 

we provide a rolling forecast that allows flex to stock component parts and other materials plan capacity and build finished goods inventory in anticipation of enduser demand flex procures components in volumes consistent with our forecast assembles the products and tests them according to our specifications generally we do not own the system components hardware components for our products consist primarily of commodity parts and certain custom components many of our components are purchased from sources which we believe are readily available from other suppliers however we currently purchase several hardware components used in the assembly of our products from a number of single or limited sources lead times for these components vary significantly and are increasing in light of global shortages of critical components global supply chain constraints continue to decrease our visibility into component availability and lead times even for commodity components per the terms and conditions with our agreement with flex  if the components are unused or the products are not sold within specified periods of time we may incur carrying charges or obsolete material charges for components that our contract manufacturers purchased to build products to meet our forecast or customer orders 

systems built in guadalajara are shipped to the flex fulfillment center in milpitas california for distribution primarily to distributors valueadded resellers or end users in emea and the americas systems built and fulfilled in zhuhai are for distribution to partners and customers in apac title to the products transfers from flex to us and then to our customers upon shipment from a designated fulfillment location 

backlog 

backlog is primarily systemsbased and represents orders confirmed with a purchase order for products to be fulfilled and invoiced to customers with approved credit status orders are subject to cancellation rescheduling by customers or product specification changes by customers although we believe that the backlog orders are firm purchase orders may be canceled by the customer prior to fulfillment without significant penalty for this reason we believe that our product backlog at any given date is not a reliable indicator of future revenues at the end of fiscal year 2022 we had product backlog of approximately 231 million

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the other information in this report the following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating our company and operations 

our business could be adversely impacted by conditions affecting the information technology market 

a substantial portion of our business depends on the demand for information technology by large enterprise customers and service providers we are dependent upon the overall economic health of our current and prospective customers and the continued growth and evolution of the internet international national regional and local economic conditions such as recessionary economic cycles protracted economic slowdown or further deterioration of the economy could adversely impact demand for our products demand for our products and services depends substantially upon the general demand for application delivery products and associated services which fluctuates based on numerous factors including capital spending levels and growth of our current and prospective customers as well as general economic conditions moreover the purchase of our products is often discretionary and may involve a significant commitment of capital and other resources future economic projections for the information technology sector are uncertain as companies continue to reassess their spending for technology projects and embrace new models for delivery of it services such as cloud computing and highly orchestrated software defined networking environments as a result spending priorities for our current and future customers may vary and demand for our products and services may be impacted in addition customer buying patterns are changing over time and more customers seek to rent software on a subscription basis and to reduce their total cost of ownership these evolving business models could lead to changes in demand and licensing strategies which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

cloudbased and saas computing trends present competitive and execution risks 

customers are transitioning to a hybrid computing environment utilizing various cloudbased software and services accessed via various smart client devices pricing and delivery models are evolving and our competitors are developing and deploying cloudbased services for customers in addition new cloud infrastructures are enabling the emergence of new competitors including large cloud providers who offer their own application security and delivery functionality as well as smaller companies targeting the growing numbers of born in the cloud applications we are devoting significant resources to develop and deploy our own competing cloudbased and saas software and services strategies while we believe our expertise and investments in software and infrastructure for cloudbased services provides us with a strong foundation to compete it is uncertain whether our strategies will attract the customers or generate the revenue required to be successful in addition to software development costs we are incurring costs to build and maintain infrastructure to support cloudcomputing and saas services and the securitization of our customers’ data these costs may reduce the gross and operating margins we have previously achieved whether we are successful in this new business model depends on our execution in a number of areas including 

• continuing to innovate and bring to market compelling cloudbased and saas services through consumption models that generate increasing traffic and market share 

• maintaining the utility compatibility and performance of our software on the growing array of cloud and saas computing platforms and the enhanced interoperability requirements associated with orchestration of cloud computing environments and 

• implementing the infrastructure and the securitization of our customers data to deliver our own cloudbased and saas services 

these new business models may reduce our revenues or gross and operating margins and could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

industry consolidation may result in increased competition 

some of our competitors have made acquisitions or entered into partnerships or other strategic relationships to offer a more comprehensive solution than they had previously offered we have also entered into large strategic partnerships to enhance our competitive position in the marketplace as it companies attempt to strengthen or maintain their market positions in the evolving application delivery mobility cloud networking and cloud platform markets these companies continue to seek to deliver comprehensive it solutions to end users and combine enterpriselevel hardware and software solutions that may compete with our solutions and which could negatively impact our partnerships these consolidators or potential consolidators may have significantly greater financial technical and other resources than we do and may be better positioned to acquire and offer complementary products and services the companies resulting from these possible combinations may create more compelling product and service offerings and be able to offer greater pricing flexibility or sales and marketing support for such offerings than we can these heightened competitive pressures could result in a loss of customers or a reduction in our revenues or revenue growth rates all of which could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

we may not be able to compete effectively in the emerging application delivery and security market 

the markets we serve are new rapidly evolving and highly competitive and we expect competition to persist and intensify in the future as we expand our reach and role into a broader set of multicloud solutions the companies that we consider competitors evolves as well in addition to server load balancing traffic management and other functions normally associated with application delivery our suite of solutions has expanded our addressable market into security and policy management where we compete with a number of companies focused on niche areas of application security 

we expect to continue to face additional competition as new participants enter our markets as we continue to expand globally we may see new competitors in different geographic regions in addition larger companies with significant resources brand recognition and sales channels may form alliances with or acquire competing application services solutions from other companies and emerge as significant competitors potential competitors may bundle their products or incorporate an internet traffic management or security component into existing products in a manner that discourages users from purchasing our products any of these circumstances may limit our opportunities for growth and negatively impact our financial performance 

our success depends on our timely development of new software and systems products and features market acceptance of new software and systems product offerings and proper management of the timing of the life cycle of our software and systems products 

the markets for our products and services are characterized by 

• rapid technological change 

• evolving industry standards 

• consolidation of network and application functions into existing network infrastructure products 

• requirements that our products interoperate with those of other it vendors to enable ease of management 

• fluctuations in customer demand 

• changes in customer requirements and 

• frequent new product and service introductions and enhancements 

our continued success depends on our ability to identify and develop new software and systems products and new features for our existing software and systems products to meet the demands of these changes and the acceptance of those products and features by our existing and target customers in addition our software and systems products must interoperate with our end customers’ it infrastructure including the expanding use of the cloud and hybrid cloud environments which often have different specifications deploy products from multiple vendors and utilize multiple protocol standards our customers’ it infrastructure is becoming more complex and we may be reliant on orchestration and interoperability with third party vendors on whom we are reliant for testing and support of new software and systems product versions and configurations if we are unable to identify develop and deploy new software and systems products and new product features on a timely basis our business and results of operations may be harmed 

the current development cycle for our software and systems products varies and has become increasingly complex due to the sophistication and the addressing of our customers needs the development timetable to commercial release and availability to our customers is uncertain and the introduction of new products or product enhancements may shorten the life cycle of our existing products or replace sales of some of our current products thereby offsetting the benefit of even a successful product introduction and may cause customers to defer purchasing our existing products in anticipation of the new products this could harm our operating results by decreasing sales of our software and systems products or increasing our inventory levels of older systems products and exposing us to greater risk of product obsolescence we have also experienced and may in the future experience delays in developing and releasing new software and systems products and related product enhancements this has led to and may in the future lead to delayed sales increased expenses and lower quarterly revenue than anticipated also in the development of our systems products we have experienced delays in the prototyping which in turn has led to delays in product introductions in addition complexity and difficulties in managing product transitions at the endoflife stage of a product can create excess inventory of components associated with the outgoing product that can lead to increased expenses any or all of the above problems could materially harm our business and results of operations 

our success depends on sales and continued innovation of our application delivery and security product lines 

we expect to derive a significant portion of our net revenues from the sale of our software and hardware application delivery and security product lines in the future implementation of our strategy depends upon these products being able to solve critical network availability performance and security problems for our customers if our products are unable to solve these problems for our customers or if we are unable to sustain the high levels of innovation in product feature sets needed to maintain leadership in what will continue to be a competitive market environment our business and results of operations will be harmed 

security vulnerabilities in our it systems or products as well as unforeseen product errors could have a material adverse impact on our business results of operations financial condition and reputation 

in the ordinary course of business we store sensitive data including intellectual property personal data our proprietary business information and that of our customers suppliers and business partners on our networks in addition we store sensitive data through cloudbased services that may be hosted by third parties and in data center infrastructure maintained by third parties the secure maintenance of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy our information systems and those of our partners and customers are subject to the increasing threat of intrusions by a wide range of actors including computer programmers hackers or sophisticated nationstate and nationstate supported actors or they may be compromised due to employee error or wrongful conduct malfeasance or other disruptions despite our security measures and those of our thirdparty vendors our information technology and infrastructure has experienced breaches or disruptions and may be 

vulnerable in the future to breach attacks or disruptions if any breach or attack compromises our networks creates system disruptions or slowdowns or exploits security vulnerabilities of our products the information stored on our networks or those of our customers could be accessed and modified publicly disclosed lost or stolen and we may be subject to liability to our customers suppliers business partners and others and suffer reputational and financial harm 

in addition our products are used to manage critical applications and data for customers and third parties may attempt to exploit security vulnerabilities in our products as well as our internal it systems as we continue to focus on the development and marketing of security solutions we become a bigger target for malicious computer hackers including sophisticated nationstate and nationstate supported actors who wish to exploit security vulnerabilities in our products or it systems 

we devote significant resources to addressing security vulnerabilities in our it systems product solutions and services through our efforts to engineer more secure solutions and services enhance security and reliability features in our solutions and services deploy security updates to address security vulnerabilities and seek to respond to known security incidents in sufficient time to minimize any potential adverse impact despite our efforts to harden our infrastructure and build secure solutions from time to time we experience attacks and other cyberthreats these attacks can seek to exploit among other things known or unknown vulnerabilities in technology included in our it infrastructure solutions and services while we have undertaken efforts to mitigate these vulnerabilities they could render our internal systems products and solutions and services susceptible to a cyberattack 

our products may also contain undetected errors or defects when first introduced or as new versions are released we have experienced these errors or defects in the past in connection with new products and product upgrades as our products and customer it infrastructures become increasingly complex customers may experience unforeseen errors in implementing our products into their it environments we expect that these errors or defects will be found from time to time in new or enhanced products after commencement of commercial shipments these problems may cause us to incur significant warranty and repair costs divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts and cause significant customer relations problems we may also be subject to liability claims for damages related to product errors or defects while we carry insurance policies covering this type of liability these policies may not provide sufficient protection should a claim be asserted a material product liability claim may harm our business and results of operations 

our products must successfully operate with products from other vendors as a result when problems occur in a network it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem the occurrence of software or hardware problems whether caused by our products or another vendor’s products may result in the delay or loss of market acceptance of our products the occurrence of any of these problems may harm our business and results of operations 

any errors defects or vulnerabilities in our products or it systems could result in 

• expenditures of significant financial and product development resources in efforts to analyze correct eliminate or workaround errors and defects or to address and eliminate vulnerabilities 

• remediation costs such as liability for stolen assets or information repairs or system damage 

• increased cybersecurity protection costs which may include systems and technology changes training and engagement of third party experts and consultants 

• increased insurance premiums 

• loss of existing or potential customers or channel partners 

• loss of proprietary information leading to lost competitive positioning and lost revenues 

• negative publicity and damage to our reputation 

• delayed or lost revenue 

• delay or failure to attain market acceptance 

• an increase in warranty claims compared with our historical experience or an increased cost of servicing warranty claims either of which would adversely affect our gross margins and 

• litigation regulatory inquiries or investigations that may be costly and harm our reputation 

we are dependent on various information technology systems and failures of or interruptions to those systems could harm our business 

many of our business processes depend upon our it systems the systems and processes of third parties including cloud hosting service providers and on interfaces with the systems of third parties for example our order entry system provides 

information to the systems of our contract manufacturers which enables them to build and ship our products if those systems fail or are interrupted or if our ability to connect to or interact with one or more networks is interrupted our processes may function at a diminished level or not at all this could harm our ability to ship products or our ability to deliver cloudbased services which could harm our financial results 

in addition reconfiguring our it systems or other business processes in response to changing business needs may be timeconsuming and costly to the extent this impacted our ability to react timely to specific market or business opportunities our financial results may be harmed 

our failure to adequately protect personal information could have a material adverse effect on our business 

a wide variety of local state national and international laws directives and regulations apply to the collection use retention protection disclosure transfer and other processing of personal data these data protection and privacyrelated laws and regulations continue to evolve and may result in everincreasing regulatory and public scrutiny and escalating levels of enforcement and sanctions and increased costs of compliance certain safeharbor exemptions upon which the company relies for data transfers have been challenged and may no longer be available to us in the future our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or to protect such data could result in enforcement action against us including fines imprisonment of company officials and public censure claims for damages by endcustomers and other affected individuals damage to our reputation and loss of goodwill both in relation to existing endcustomers and prospective endcustomers any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations financial performance and business changing definitions of personal data and personal information within the european union the united states and elsewhere especially relating to classification of ip addresses machine identification location data and other information may limit or inhibit our ability to operate or expand our business including limiting strategic partnerships that may involve the sharing of data the evolving data protection regulatory environment may require significant management attention and financial resources to analyze and modify our it infrastructure to meet these changing requirements all of which could reduce our operating margins and impact our operating results and financial condition 

our success depends on our key personnel and our ability to hire retain and motivate qualified executives sales and marketing operations product development and professional services personnel 

our success depends in large part on our ability to attract engage retain and integrate qualified executives and other key employees throughout all areas of our business in order to attract and retain executives and other key employees in a competitive marketplace we must provide a competitive compensation package including cash and equitybased compensation if we do not obtain the stockholder approval needed to continue granting equity compensation in a competitive manner our ability to attract retain and motivate executives and key employees could be weakened failure to successfully hire executives and key employees or the loss of any executives and key employees could have a significant impact on our operations we have recently experienced changes in our senior leadership team and we expect to continue to see changes as we build the team that is needed to execute our strategy changes in our management team may be disruptive to our business and any failure to successfully integrate key new hires or promoted employees could adversely affect our business and results of operations the complexity of our products and their integration into existing networks and ongoing support as well as the sophistication of our sales and marketing effort requires us to retain highly trained developers professional services customer support and sales personnel competition for qualified developers professional services customer support and sales personnel in our industry is intense especially in silicon valley and seattle where we have substantial operations and a need for highly skilled personnel because of the limited number of people available with the necessary technical skills and understanding of our products also to the extent we hire personnel from competitors we may be subject to allegations that they have been improperly solicited that they have divulged proprietary or other confidential information that they have violated noncompete obligations to their prior employers or that their former employers own their inventions or other work product our ability to hire and retain these personnel may be adversely affected by volatility or reductions in the price of our common stock or our ability to get approval from shareholders to offer additional common stock to our employees since these employees are generally granted restricted stock units the loss of services of any of our key personnel the inability to retain and attract qualified personnel in the future or delays in hiring qualified personnel may harm our business and results of operations in addition we recently announced a restructuring to realign our workforce to match strategic and financial objectives and optimize resources for long term growth including a reduction in force program impacting a number of employees this restructuring could lead to increased attrition amongst those employees who were not directly affected by the reduction in force program 

acquisitions present many risks and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that are contemplated at the time of the transaction 

with respect to our past acquisitions as well as any other future acquisitions we may undertake we may find that the acquired businesses products or technologies do not further our business strategy as expected that we paid more than what the assets are later worth or that economic conditions change all of which may generate future impairment charges our acquisitions may be viewed negatively by customers financial markets or investors there may be difficulty integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired business and we may have difficulty retaining the key personnel of the acquired business we may have difficulty in integrating the acquired technologies or products with our existing product lines our ongoing business and management’s attention may be disrupted or diverted by transition or integration issues and the complexity of managing geographically and culturally diverse locations we may have difficulty maintaining uniform standards controls procedures and policies across locations we may experience significant problems or liabilities associated with product quality technology and other matters 

our inability to successfully operate and integrate newlyacquired businesses appropriately effectively and in a timely manner or to retain key personnel of any acquired business could have a material adverse effect on our ability to take advantage of further growth in demand for integrated traffic management and security solutions and other advances in technology as well as on our revenues gross margins and expenses 

we recently implemented a restructuring program which we cannot guarantee will achieve its intended result 

in the first fiscal quarter of 2022 we completed a restructuring program to match strategic and financial objectives and optimize resources for long term growth we incur substantial costs to implement restructuring plans and our restructuring activities may subject us to litigation risks and expenses our past restructuring plans do not provide any assurance that additional restructuring plans will not be required or implemented in the future in addition our restructuring plans may have other consequences such as attrition beyond our planned reduction in workforce a negative effect on employee morale and productivity or our ability to attract highly skilled employees our competitors may also use our restructuring plans to seek to gain a competitive advantage over us as a result our restructuring plans may affect our revenue and other operating results in the future 

the average selling price of our products may decrease and our costs may increase which may negatively impact revenues and profits 

it is possible that the average selling prices of our products will decrease in the future in response to competitive pricing pressures increased sales discounts including responses to inflationary pressures new product introductions by us or our competitors or other factors therefore in order to maintain our profits we must develop and introduce new products and product enhancements on a timely basis and continually reduce our product costs our failure to do so could cause our revenue and profits to decline which would harm our business and results of operations in addition we may experience substantial periodtoperiod fluctuations in future operating results due to the erosion of our average selling prices 

our business may be harmed if our contract manufacturers are not able to provide us with adequate supplies of our products or if a single source of hardware assembly is lost or impaired 

we outsource the manufacturing of our hardware platforms to third party contract manufacturers who assemble these hardware platforms to our specifications we have experienced minor delays in shipments from contract manufacturers in the past however if we experience major delays in the future or other problems such as inferior quality and insufficient quantity of product any one or a combination of these factors may harm our business and results of operations the inability of our contract manufacturers to provide us with adequate supplies of our products or the loss of one or more of our contract manufacturers may cause a delay in our ability to fulfill orders while we obtain a replacement manufacturer and may harm our business and results of operations in particular we currently subcontract manufacturing of our products to a single contract manufacturer if our arrangement with this single source of hardware assembly was terminated or otherwise impaired and we were not able to engage another contract manufacturer in a timely manner our business financial condition and results of operation could be adversely affected 

if the demand for our products grows we will need to increase our raw material and component purchases contract manufacturing capacity and internal test and quality control functions any disruptions in product flow may limit our revenue may harm our competitive position and may result in additional costs or cancellation of orders by our customers 

our business could suffer if there are any interruptions or delays in the supply of hardware components from our thirdparty sources 

we currently purchase several hardware components used in the assembly of our products from a number of single or limited sources lead times for these components vary significantly and are increasing in light of global shortages of critical components global supply chain constraints in the wake of the covid19 pandemic continue to decrease our visibility into component availability and lead times despite efforts to mitigate the effects of supply chain constraints the unavailability of suitable components any interruption or delay in the supply of any of these hardware components or the inability to procure a similar component from alternate sources at acceptable prices within a reasonable time may delay assembly and our ability to fulfill our sales of our products and hence our revenues and may harm our business and results of operations 

it is difficult to predict our future operating results because we have an unpredictable sales cycle 

our products have a lengthy sales cycle and the timing of our revenue is difficult to predict historically our sales cycle has ranged from approximately two to three months and has tended to lengthen as our products become increasingly complex also as our distribution strategy is focused on a channel model utilizing valueadded resellers distributors and systems integrators the level of variability in the length of sales cycle across transactions has increased and made it more difficult to predict the timing of many of our sales transactions sales of our products require us to educate potential customers in their use and benefits sales of our products are subject to delays from the lengthy internal budgeting approval and competitive evaluation processes that large enterprises and governmental entities may require for example customers frequently begin by evaluating our products on a limited basis and devote time and resources to testing our products before they decide whether or not to purchase customers may also defer orders as a result of anticipated releases of new products or enhancements by our competitors or us as a result our products have an unpredictable sales cycle that contributes to the uncertainty of our future operating results 

we may not be able to sustain or develop new distribution relationships and a reduction or delay in sales to significant distribution partners could hurt our business 

we sell our products and services through multiple distribution channels in the united states and internationally including leading industry distributors valueadded resellers systems integrators service providers and other indirect channel partners we have a limited number of agreements with companies in these channels and we may not be able to increase our number of distribution relationships or maintain our existing relationships recruiting and retaining qualified channel partners and training them in our technologies requires significant time and resources these channel partners may also market sell and support products and services that are competitive with ours and may devote more resources to the marketing sales and support of such competitive products our indirect sales channel structure could subject us to lawsuits potential liability and reputational harm if for example any of our channel partners misrepresent the functionality of our products or services to customers or violate laws or our corporate policies if we are unable to establish or maintain our indirect sales channels our business and results of operations will be harmed in addition two worldwide distributors of our products accounted for 334 of our total net revenue for fiscal year 2022 a substantial reduction or delay in sales of our products to these distribution partners if not replaced by sales to other indirect channel partners and distributors could harm our business operating results and financial condition 

a portion of our revenue is generated by sales to government entities which are subject to a number of challenges and risks 

sales to us and foreign federal state and local governmental agency endcustomers account for a significant portion of our revenues and we may in the future increase sales to government entities sales to government entities are subject to a number of risks selling to government entities can be highly competitive expensive and time consuming often requiring significant upfront time and expense without any assurance that these efforts will generate a sale the substantial majority of our sales to date to government entities have been made indirectly through our channel partners government certification requirements for products like ours may change thereby restricting our ability to sell into the federal government sector until we have attained the revised certification government demand and payment for our products and services may be impacted by public sector budgetary cycles and funding authorizations with funding reductions or delays adversely affecting public sector demand for our products and services government entities may have statutory contractual or other legal rights to terminate contracts with our distributors and resellers for convenience or due to a default and any such termination may adversely impact our future operating results governments routinely investigate and audit government contractors’ administrative processes and any unfavorable audit could result in the government refusing to continue buying our products and services a reduction of revenue or fines or civil or criminal liability if the audit uncovers improper or illegal activities which could adversely impact our operating results in a material way finally for purchases by the us government the government may require certain products to be manufactured in the united states and other relatively high cost manufacturing locations and we may not manufacture all products in locations that meet the requirements of the us government affecting our ability to sell these products to the us government 

misuse of our products could harm our reputation 

our products may be misused by endcustomers or third parties that obtain access to our products for example our products could be used to censor private access to certain information on the internet such use of our products for censorship could result in negative publicity and damage to our reputation in addition as many of our products are subject to export control regulations diversion of our products to restricted third parties by others could result in investigations penalties fines trade restrictions and negative publicity that could damage our reputation and materially impact our business operating results and financial condition 

our quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate in future periods which may cause our stock price to fluctuate 

our quarterly and annual operating results have varied significantly in the past and could vary significantly in the future which makes it difficult for us to predict our future operating results our operating results may fluctuate due to a variety of factors many of which are outside of our control including the changing and recently volatile us and global economic environment which may cause our stock price to fluctuate in particular we anticipate that the size of customer orders may increase as we continue to focus on larger business accounts a delay in the recognition of revenue even from just one account may have a significant negative impact on our results of operations for a given period in the past a majority of our sales have been realized near the end of a quarter accordingly a delay in an anticipated sale past the end of a particular quarter may negatively impact our results of operations for that quarter or in some cases that fiscal year additionally we have exposure to the credit risks of some of our customers and subtenants although we have programs in place that are designed to monitor and mitigate the associated risk there can be no assurance that such programs will be effective in reducing our credit risks adequately we monitor individual payment capability in granting credit arrangements seek to limit the total credit to amounts we believe our customers can pay and maintain reserves we believe are adequate to cover exposure for potential losses if there is a deterioration of a subtenant’s or a major customer’s creditworthiness or actual defaults are higher than expected future losses if incurred could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our operating results further our operating results may be below the expectations of securities analysts and investors in future quarters or years our failure to meet these expectations will likely harm the market price of our common stock such a decline could occur and has occurred in the past even when we have met our publicly stated revenue andor earnings guidance 

reliance on fulfillment at the end of the quarter could cause our revenue for the applicable period to fall below expected levels 

as a result of customer buying patterns and the efforts of our sales force and channel partners to meet or exceed their sales objectives we have historically received a substantial portion of sales orders and generated a substantial portion of revenue during the last few weeks of each fiscal quarter in addition any significant interruption in our information technology systems which manage critical functions such as order processing revenue recognition financial forecasts inventory and supply chain management and trade compliance reviews could result in delayed order fulfillment and decreased revenue for that fiscal quarter if expected revenue at the end of any fiscal quarter is delayed for any reason including the failure of anticipated purchase orders to materialize our third party contract manufacturers’ inability to manufacture and ship products prior to fiscal quarterend to fulfill purchase orders received near the end of the fiscal quarter our failure to manage inventory to meet demand our inability to release new products on schedule any failure of our systems related to order review and processing or any delays in shipments based on trade compliance requirements our revenue for that quarter could fall below our expectations resulting in a decline in the trading price of our common stock 

changes in financial accounting standards may cause adverse unexpected revenue fluctuations and affect our reported results of operations 

a change in accounting policies can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective new pronouncements and varying interpretations of existing pronouncements have occurred with frequency and may occur in the future changes to existing rules or changes to the interpretations of existing rules could lead to changes in our accounting practices and such changes could adversely affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business 

if we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting the accuracy and timeliness of our financial reporting may be adversely affected 

as a public company we are required to design and maintain proper and effective internal controls over financial reporting and to report any material weaknesses in such internal controls section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 requires that we evaluate and determine the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting and provide a management report on the internal controls over financial reporting which must be attested to by our independent registered public accounting firm we have an ongoing program to review the design of our internal controls framework in keeping with changes in business needs implement necessary changes to our controls design and test the system and process controls necessary to comply with these requirements if in the future our internal controls over financial reporting are determined to be not effective resulting in a material weakness investor perceptions regarding the reliability of our financial statements may be adversely affected which could cause a decline in the market price of our stock and otherwise negatively affect our liquidity and financial condition 

we may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities 

our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be affected by changes in our business operations including acquisitions new offerings and changes in the jurisdictions in which we operate the provision for income taxes may also be impacted by changes in stockbased compensation changes in the research and development tax credit laws earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and being higher than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates transfer pricing adjustments not meeting the terms and conditions of tax holidays or incentives changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in actual results versus our estimates or changes in tax laws regulations accounting principles or interpretations thereof including changes to the tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals our results of operations and cash flows could be affected by future guidance implementing the provisions of the tax cuts and jobs act in addition we may be subject to examination of our income tax returns by the us internal revenue service and other tax authorities while we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes from such examinations and the adequacy of our provision for income taxes there can be no assurance that such provision is sufficient and that a determination by a tax authority will not have an adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows 

we face litigation risks 

we are a party to lawsuits in the normal course of our business litigation in general and intellectual property and securities litigation in particular can be expensive lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations moreover the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict responding to lawsuits has been and will likely continue to be expensive and timeconsuming for us an unfavorable resolution of these lawsuits could adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property and our products may infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties 

we rely on a combination of patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure of confidential and proprietary information to protect our intellectual property rights despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology monitoring unauthorized use of our products is difficult and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of our technology particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 

our industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the ordinary course of our business we are involved in disputes and licensing discussions with others regarding their claimed proprietary rights and cannot provide assurance that we will always successfully defend ourselves against such claims and such matters are subject to many uncertainties and outcomes are not predictable with assurance we expect that infringement claims may increase as the number of products and competitors in our market increases and overlaps occur also as we have gained greater visibility market exposure and competitive success we face a higher risk of being the subject of intellectual property infringement claims if we are found to infringe the proprietary rights of others or if we otherwise settle such claims we could be compelled to pay damages or royalties and either obtain a license to those intellectual property rights or alter our products so that they no longer infringe upon such proprietary rights any license could be very expensive to obtain or may not be available at all or may require us to make royalty payments which could adversely affect gross margins in future periods the actual liability in any such matters may be materially different from our estimate if any which could result in the need to adjust the liability and record additional expenses similarly changing our products or processes to avoid infringing upon the rights of others may be costly or impractical in addition we have initiated and may in the future initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to determine the scope and validity of our proprietary rights or those of our competitors any of these claims whether claims that we are infringing the proprietary rights of others or vice versa with or without merit may be timeconsuming result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel or require us to cease using infringing technology develop noninfringing technology or enter into royalty or licensing agreements further our license agreements typically require us to indemnify our customers distributors and resellers for infringement actions related to our technology which could cause us to become involved in infringement claims made against our customers distributors or resellers any of the abovedescribed circumstances relating to intellectual property rights disputes could result in our business and results of operations being harmed 

we incorporate open source software into our products although we monitor our use of open source closely the terms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by us courts and there is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products we could also be subject to similar conditions or restrictions should there be any changes in the licensing terms of the open source software incorporated into our products in either event we could be required to seek licenses from third parties in order to continue offering our products to reengineer our products or to discontinue the sale of our products in the event reengineering cannot be accomplished on a timely or successful basis any of which could adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

many of our products include intellectual property licensed from third parties in the future it may be necessary to renew licenses for third party intellectual property or obtain new licenses for other technology these third party licenses may not be available to us on acceptable terms if at all the inability to obtain certain licenses or litigation regarding the interpretation or enforcement of license rights and related intellectual property issues could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition furthermore we license some third party intellectual property on a nonexclusive basis and this may limit our ability to protect our intellectual property rights in our products 

global economic and geopolitical conditions may harm our industry business and results of operations 

we operate globally and as a result our business revenues and profitability are impacted by global macroeconomic conditions the success of our activities is affected by general economic and market conditions including among others inflation interest rates tax rates economic uncertainty political instability warfare changes in laws trade barriers and economic and trade sanctions the us capital markets experienced and continue to experience extreme volatility and disruption following the global outbreak of covid19 in 2020 and the russian invasion of ukraine in 2022 furthermore inflation rates in the us have recently increased to levels not seen in decades such economic volatility could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows and future market disruptions could negatively impact us these unfavorable economic conditions could increase our operating costs which could negatively impact our profitability geopolitical destabilization and warfare have impacted and could continue to impact global currency exchange rates 

commodity prices trade and movement of resources which may adversely affect the buying power of our customers our access to and cost of resources from our suppliers and ability to operate or grow our business 

additionally we have offices and employees located in regions that historically have and may experience periods of political instability warfare changes in laws trade barriers and economic and trade sanctions adverse conditions in these countries directly affect our operations as a result our operations and employees could be disrupted and may not be able to function at full capacity which could adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows further while our ability to do business has not been materially affected the russian invasion of ukraine and the global restrictive measures that have been taken and could be taken in the future have created significant global economic uncertainty that could prolong and escalate tensions and expand the geopolitical conflict which could have a lasting impact on regional and global economies any of which could harm our business and operating results 

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates which could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our sales contracts are denominated in us dollars and therefore substantially all of our revenue is not subject to foreign currency risk however a strengthening of the us dollar could increase the real cost of our solutions to our end customers outside of the united states which could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results in addition an increasing portion of our operating expenses is incurred outside the united states is denominated in foreign currencies and is subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates if we become more exposed to currency fluctuations and are not able to successfully hedge against the risks associated with currency fluctuations our operating results could be adversely affected to date we have not entered into any hedging arrangements with respect to foreign currency risk or other derivative instruments 

the effects of a pandemic or widespread health epidemic such as the coronavirus outbreak could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

the covid19 pandemic has disrupted the us and global economies and put unprecedented strain on governments healthcare systems educational institutions businesses and individuals around the world the impact and duration of which is difficult to assess or predict it is especially difficult to predict the impact on the global economic markets which have been and will continue to be highly dependent upon the actions of governments businesses and other enterprises in response to the pandemic as well as the effectiveness of those actions 

the impacts of the global pandemic on our business and financial outlook are currently unknown areas that may or may not be adversely disrupted or impacted by the covid19 pandemic include but are not limited to customer demand for our products and services reductions in customer spend delayed or the inability to collect from our customers disruptions to our supply chain that could result in delays shortages or increased costs of our products disruptions to our operations in servicing our customers as a result of working remotely or business location closures which all may adversely impact our business results of operations and overall financial performance in future periods 

our operating results are exposed to risks associated with international commerce 

as our international sales increase our operating results become more exposed to international operating risks additionally our international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks including the following 

• greater difficulty in enforcing contracts and accounts receivable collection and longer collection periods 

• the uncertainty of protection for intellectual property rights in some countries 

• greater risk of unexpected changes in regulatory practices tariffs and tax laws and treaties 

• risks associated with trade restrictions and foreign legal requirements including the importation certification and localization of our products required in foreign countries 

• greater risk of a failure of foreign employees partners distributors and resellers to comply with both us and foreign laws including antitrust regulations the us foreign corrupt practices act and any trade regulations ensuring fair trade practices 

• heightened risk of unfair or corrupt business practices in certain geographies and of improper or fraudulent sales arrangements that may impact financial results and result in restatements of or irregularities in financial statements 

• increased expenses incurred in establishing and maintaining office space and equipment for our international operations 

• greater difficulty in recruiting local experienced personnel and the costs and expenses associated with such activities 

• management communication and integration problems resulting from cultural and geographic dispersion 

• fluctuations in exchange rates between the us dollar and foreign currencies in markets where we do business 

• economic uncertainty around the world including continued economic uncertainty as a result of sovereign debt issues in europe and 

• general economic and political conditions in these foreign markets 

in addition on january 31 2020 the united kingdom withdrew from the european union commonly referred to as brexit brexit could lead to economic and legal uncertainty including volatility in global stock markets and currency exchange rates and increasingly divergent laws regulations and licensing requirements any of these effects of brexit among others could adversely affect our operations and financial results 

we must hire and train experienced personnel to staff and manage our foreign operations to the extent that we experience difficulties in recruiting training managing and retaining an international staff and specifically staff related to sales management and sales personnel we may experience difficulties in sales productivity in foreign markets we also enter into strategic distributor and reseller relationships with companies in certain international markets where we do not have a local presence if we are not able to maintain successful strategic distributor relationships internationally or recruit additional companies to enter into strategic distributor relationships our future success in these international markets could be limited business practices in the international markets that we serve may differ from those in the united states and may require us in the future to include terms other than our standard terms in customer contracts we intend to continue expanding into international markets 

these factors and other factors could harm our ability to gain future international revenues and consequently materially impact our business operating results and financial condition the expansion of our existing international operations and entry into additional international markets will require significant management attention and financial resources our failure to successfully manage our international operations and the associated risks effectively could limit the future growth of our business 

we are subject to governmental export and import controls that could subject us to liability or impair our ability to compete in international markets 

our products are subject to us export controls and may be exported outside the us only with the required level of export license or through an export license exception because we incorporate encryption technology into our products in addition various countries regulate the import of certain encryption technology and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute our products or our customers’ ability to implement our products in those countries changes in our products or changes in export and import regulations may create delays in the introduction of our products in international markets prevent our customers with international operations from deploying our products throughout their global systems or in some cases prevent the export or import of our products to certain countries altogether any change in export or import regulations or related legislation shift in approach to the enforcement or scope of existing regulations or change in the countries persons or technologies targeted by such regulations could result in decreased use of our products by or in our decreased ability to export or sell our products to existing or potential customers with international operations any decreased use of our products or limitation on our ability to export or sell our products would likely adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

changes in governmental regulations could negatively affect our revenues 

many of our products are subject to various regulations promulgated by the united states and various foreign governments including but not limited to environmental regulations and regulations implementing export license requirements and restrictions on the import or export of some technologies especially encryption technology changes in governmental regulation and our inability or failure to obtain required approvals permits or registrations could harm our international and domestic sales and adversely affect our revenues business and operations 

new regulations related to conflict minerals may force us to incur additional expenses and could limit the supply and increase the costs of certain metals and minerals used in the manufacturing of our products 

in august 2012 the sec adopted new requirements under the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 or the doddfrank act for companies that use certain minerals and derivative metals referred to as conflict minerals regardless of their country of origin in their products whether or not these products are manufactured by third parties the doddfrank act requires companies to perform due diligence and disclose whether or not such minerals originate from the democratic republic of congo or adjoining countries we filed a report on form sd with the sec regarding such 

matters on may 31 2022 these requirements could adversely affect the sourcing availability and pricing of minerals or metals used in the manufacture of our products and the numerous components that go into our products all of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results in addition we will incur additional costs to comply with the disclosure requirements including costs related to determining the source of any relevant minerals and metals used in our products we have a complex supply chain and many components are sourced through our contract manufacturer and we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins for these minerals and metals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement as a result we may face reputational challenges with our customers and other stakeholders and possible regulatory risk 

antitakeover provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us 

our board of directors has the authority to issue up to 10000000 shares of preferred stock and to determine the price rights preferences privileges and restrictions including voting rights of those shares without any further vote or action by the shareholders the rights of the holders of common stock may be subject to and may be adversely affected by the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future the issuance of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a change of control of our company without further action by our shareholders and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of the holders of common stock further certain provisions of our bylaws including a provision limiting the ability of shareholders to raise matters at a meeting of shareholders without giving advance notice may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or management of our company which could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock similarly state antitakeover laws in the state of washington related to corporate takeovers may prevent or delay a change of control of our company 

our stock price could be volatile particularly during times of economic uncertainty and volatility in domestic and international stock markets 

our stock price has been volatile and has fluctuated significantly in the past the trading price of our stock is likely to continue to be volatile and subject to fluctuations in the future some of the factors that could significantly affect the market price of our stock include 

• actual or anticipated variations in operating and financial results 

• analyst reports or recommendations 

• rumors announcements or press articles regarding our competitors’ operations management organization financial condition or financial statements and 

• other events or factors many of which are beyond our control 

the stock market in general and the market for technology companies in particular have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations these fluctuations have often been unrelated or disproportionate to operating performance the fluctuations may continue in the future and this could significantly impact the value of our stock and your investment 

if securities or industry analysts publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business or discontinue publishing research about our business the price and trading volume of our securities could decline 

the trading market for our common stock is influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us our business our market or our competitors if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our common stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business the price of our securities would likely decline if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly demand for our securities could decrease which might cause the price and trading volume of our securities to decline 

our business is subject to the risks of earthquakes fire power outages floods and other catastrophic events and to interruption by manmade problems such as terrorism 

a significant natural disaster such as an earthquake a fire a flood or a significant power outage could have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition we have an administrative and product development office and a third party contract manufacturer located in the san francisco bay area a region known for seismic activity in addition natural disasters could affect our supply chain manufacturing vendors or logistics providers’ ability to provide materials and perform services such as manufacturing products or assisting with shipments on a timely basis in the event our or our service providers’ information technology systems or manufacturing or logistics abilities are hindered by any of the events discussed above shipments could be delayed resulting in missed financial targets such as revenue and shipment targets for a particular quarter in addition cyberattacks acts of terrorism or other geopolitical unrest could cause disruptions in our business or the business of our supply chain manufacturers logistics providers partners or endcustomers or the economy as a 

whole any disruption in the business of our supply chain manufacturers logistics providers partners or endcustomers that impacts sales at the end of a fiscal quarter could have a significant adverse impact on our quarterly results all of the aforementioned risks may be further increased if the disaster recovery plans for us and our suppliers prove to be inadequate to the extent that any of the above should result in delays or cancellations of customer orders or the delay in the manufacture deployment or shipment of our products our business financial condition and operating results would be adversely affected 

climate change may have an impact on our business 

risks related to climate change are increasing in both impact and type of risk we believe there will not be significant nearterm impacts to our offices worldwide due to climate change but longterm impacts remain unknown however there may be business operational risk due to the significant impacts climate change could pose to our employees’ lives our supply chain or electrical power availability from climaterelated weather events in addition rapidly changing customer and regulatory requirements to reduce carbon emissions present a risk of loss of business if we are not able to meet those requirements 

in addition to other risks listed in this “risk factors” section factors that may affect our operating results include but are not limited to 

• fluctuations in demand for our products and services due to changing market conditions pricing conditions technology evolution seasonality or other changes in the global economic environment 

• changes or fluctuations in sales and implementation cycles for our products and services 

• changes in the mix of our products and services including increases in saas and other subscriptionbased offerings

• reduced visibility into our customers’ spending and implementation plans 

• reductions in customers’ budgets for data center and other it purchases or delays in these purchases 

• changes in enduser customer attach rates and renewal rates for our services 

• fluctuations in our gross margins including the factors described herein which may contribute to such fluctuations 

• our ability to control costs including operating expenses the costs of hardware and software components and other manufacturing costs 

• our ability to develop introduce and gain market acceptance of new products technologies and services and our success in new and evolving markets 

• any significant changes in the competitive environment including the entry of new competitors or the substantial discounting of products or services 

• the timing and execution of product transitions or new product introductions and related inventory costs 

• variations in sales channels product costs or mix of products sold 

• our ability to establish and manage our distribution channels and the effectiveness of any changes we make to our distribution model 

• the ability of our contract manufacturers and suppliers to provide component parts hardware platforms and other products in a timely manner 

• benefits anticipated from our investments in sales marketing product development manufacturing or other activities 

• impacts on our overall tax rate caused by any reorganization in our corporate structure

our management team monitors and analyzes a number of key performance indicators in order to manage our business and evaluate our financial and operating performance on a consolidated basis those indicators include 

• revenues  the majority of our product revenues are derived from sales of our application security and delivery solutions including our bigip software and systems f5 nginx software and our silverline offerings our bigip software solutions are sold both on a perpetual license and a subscription basis we sell f5 nginx on a subscription basis our silverline solution is a managed services offering also sold on a subscription basis during our fiscal year 2022 we launched f5 distributed cloud services f5 distributed cloud services provides security multicloud networking and edgebased computing solutions encompassing software solutions from what were previously branded as our shape volterra and silverline product offerings f5 distributed cloud services are offered on a subscription basis under a unified softwareasaservice saas platform we also derive revenues from the sales of global services including annual maintenance contracts training and consulting services 

we monitor the sales mix of our revenues within each reporting period we believe customer acceptance rates of our new products feature enhancements and consumption models are indicators of future trends we also consider overall revenue concentration by geographic region as an additional indicator of current and future trends near term we expect challenging global supply chain conditions particularly semiconductor constraints will result in a shortfall in our ability to meet customer demand for our hardwarebased solutions thereby impacting revenues from systems sales 

• cost of revenues and gross margins we strive to control our cost of revenues and thereby maintain our gross margins significant items impacting cost of revenues are hardware costs paid to our contract manufacturers thirdparty software license fees softwareasaservice infrastructure costs amortization of developed technology and personnel and overhead expenses in addition factors such as sales price product and services mix inventory obsolescence returns component price increases warranty costs global supply chain constraints and the remaining uncertainty surrounding the covid19 pandemic could significantly impact our gross margins from quarter to quarter 

• operating expenses operating expenses are substantially driven by personnel and related overhead expenses existing headcount and future hiring plans are the predominant factors in analyzing and forecasting future operating expense trends other significant operating expenses that we monitor include marketing and promotions travel professional fees computer costs related to the development of new products and provision of services facilities and depreciation expenses 

• liquidity and cash flows our financial condition remains strong with significant cash and investments the decrease in cash and investments for fiscal year 2022 was primarily due to 5000 million of cash used for the repurchase of shares and 680 million in cash paid for the acquisition of threat stack in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 the decrease in cash and investments for fiscal year 2022 was partially offset by cash provided by operating activities of 4426 million going forward we believe the primary driver of cash flows will be net income from operations we will continue to evaluate possible acquisitions of or investments in businesses products or technologies that we believe are strategic which may 

require the use of cash additionally on january 31 2020 we entered into a revolving credit agreement the revolving credit agreement that provides for a senior unsecured revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of 3500 million the revolving credit facility we have the option to increase commitments under the revolving credit facility from time to time subject to certain conditions by up to 1500 million as of september 30 2022 there were no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility and we had available borrowing capacity of 3500 million 

• balance sheet we view cash shortterm and longterm investments deferred revenue accounts receivable balances and days sales outstanding as important indicators of our financial health deferred revenues continued to increase in fiscal 2022 due to the growth of our subscriptions business our days sales outstanding for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022 was 60 days sales outstanding is calculated by dividing ending accounts receivable by revenue per day for a given quarter 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we believe that of our significant accounting policies which are described in note 1 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity accordingly these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 

revenue recognition we sell products through distributors resellers and directly to end users revenue related to our contracts with customers is recognized by following a fivestep process 

• identify the contracts with a customer evidence of a contract generally consists of a purchase order issued pursuant to the terms and conditions of a distributor reseller or end user agreement 

• identify the performance obligations in the contract performance obligations are identified in our contracts and include hardware hardwarebased software softwareonly solutions cloudbased subscription services as well as a broad range of service performance obligations including consulting training installation and maintenance 

• determine the transaction price the purchase price stated in an agreed upon purchase order is generally representative of the transaction price we offer several programs in which customers are eligible for certain levels of rebates if certain conditions are met when determining the transaction price we consider the effects of any variable consideration 

• allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract the transaction price in a contract is allocated based upon the relative standalone selling price of each distinct performance obligation identified in the contract 

• recognize revenue when or as the entity satisfies a performance obligation we satisfy performance obligations either over time or at a point in time as discussed in further detail below revenue is recognized at the time the related performance obligation is satisfied by transferring control of promised products and services to a customer 

revenue is recognized net of any taxes collected which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities shipping and handling fees charged to our customers are recognized as product revenue in the period shipped and the related costs for providing these services are recorded as a cost of sale 

the following is a description of the principal activities from which we generate revenue 

product 

revenue from the sale of our hardware and perpetual software products is generally recognized at a point in time when the product has been fulfilled and the customer is obligated to pay for the product we also offer several products by subscription either through termbased license agreements or as saas offerings revenue for termbased license agreements is recognized at a point in time when we deliver the software license to the customer and the subscription term has commenced for our saas offerings revenue is recognized ratably as the services are provided hardware including the software run on those devices is considered systems revenue perpetual or subscription software offerings that are deployed on a standalone basis along with our saas offerings are considered software revenue when rights of return are present and we cannot estimate returns revenue is recognized when such rights of return lapse payment terms to customers are generally net 30 days to net 60 days 

global services 

revenues for postcontract customer support pcs are recognized on a straightline basis over the service contract term pcs includes a limited period of telephone support updates repair or replacement of any failed product or component that fails during the term of the agreement bug fixes and rights to upgrades when and if available consulting services are customarily billed at fixed hourly rates plus outofpocket expenses and revenues are recognized as the consulting is completed similarly training revenue is recognized as the training is completed 

contract acquisition costs 

sales commissions earned by our sales force are considered incremental and recoverable costs of obtaining a contract with a customer sales commissions for initial service contracts and subscription offerings are deferred and then amortized as an expense on a straightline basis over the period of benefit which management has determined to be 45 years and 3 years respectively 

significant judgments 

we enter into certain contracts with customers including flexible consumption programs and multiyear subscriptions with nonstandard terms and conditions management exercises significant judgment in assessing contractual terms in these arrangements to identify and evaluate performance obligations management allocates consideration to each performance obligation based on relative fair value using standalone selling price and recognizes associated revenue as control is transferred to the customer 

business combinations our business combinations are accounted for under the acquisition method we allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values the excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets 

covid19 update 

management has prioritized a humanfirst approach to the covid19 pandemic for f5 this means ensuring the health and safety of employees their families and our communities further this approach extends to our customers as we look for ways that we can support their operations

liquidity and capital resources 

we have funded our operations with our cash balances and cash generated from operations 



cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and longterm investments totaled 8941 million as of september 30 2022 compared to 10434 million as of september 30 2021 representing a decrease of 1493 million the decrease was primarily due to 5000 million of cash required for the repurchase of outstanding common stock and 680 million in cash paid for the acquisition of threat stack in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 the decrease was also driven by 336 million of capital expenditures related to the expansion of our facilities to support our operations worldwide as well as investments in information technology infrastructure and equipment purchases to support our core business activities the decrease was partially offset by cash provided by operating activities of 4426 million as of september 30 2022 628 of our cash and cash equivalents and investment balances were outside of the us the cash and cash equivalents and investment balances outside of the us are subject to fluctuation based on the settlement of intercompany balances in fiscal year 2021 the decrease to cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and longterm investments from the prior year was primarily due to 5000 million of cash required for the repurchase of outstanding common stock under our accelerated share repurchase agreements and 4113 million in cash paid for the acquisition of businesses primarily volterra in the second quarter of fiscal 2021 the decrease was also driven by 307 million of capital expenditures related to the expansion of our facilities to support our operations worldwide as well as investments in information technology infrastructure and equipment purchases to support our core business activities the decrease was partially offset by cash provided by operating activities of 6452 million as of september 30 2021 549 of our cash and cash equivalents and investment balances were outside of the us 

cash provided by operating activities during fiscal year 2022 was 4426 million compared to 6452 million in fiscal year 2021 and 6609 million in fiscal year 2020 cash provided by operating activities resulted primarily from cash generated from net income after adjusting for noncash charges such as stockbased compensation depreciation and amortization charges and changes in operating assets and liabilities cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year 2022 decreased from the prior year primarily due to strong multiyear subscription sales in fiscal year 2022 which are generally sold on threeyear terms multiyear subscriptions are billed on an annual basis with the remainder recognized on the balance sheet as unbilled assets in addition during fiscal year 2022 we had significant prepayments with our contract manufacturer associated with components for future hardwarebased solution builds 

cash from operations could be affected by various risks and uncertainties including but not limited to the risks detailed in part i item 1a titled “risk factors” however we anticipate our current cash cash equivalents and investment balances anticipated cash flows generated from operations and available borrowing capacity on the revolver credit facility will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs 

cash provided by investing activities during fiscal year 2022 was 2181 million compared to cash used in investing activities of 4453 million in fiscal year 2021 and 7470 million in fiscal year 2020 investing activities include purchases sales and maturities of availableforsale securities business acquisitions and capital expenditures cash provided by investing activities for fiscal year 2022 was primarily the result of 2604 million in maturities of investments and 1206 million in sales of investments partially offset by 680 million cash paid for the acquisition threat stack in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 and purchases of investments of 613 million cash used in investing activities for fiscal year 2021 was primarily the result of 4113 million in cash paid for the acquisition businesses primarily volterra in the second quarter of fiscal 2021 along with capital expenditures related to maintaining our operations worldwide and the purchase of investments partially offset by the maturity and sale of investments cash used in investing activities for fiscal year 2020 was primarily the result of 9556 million in cash paid for the acquisition of shape along with capital expenditures related to maintaining our operations worldwide and the purchase of investments partially offset by the maturity and sale of investments

on january 31 2020 we entered into a revolving credit agreement the revolving credit agreement that provides for a senior unsecured revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of 3500 million the revolving credit facility we have the option to increase commitments under the revolving credit facility from time to time subject to certain conditions by up to 1500 million as of september 30 2022 there were no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility and we had available borrowing capacity of 3500 million 

based on our current operating and capital expenditure forecasts we believe that our existing cash and investment balances together with cash generated from operations should be sufficient to meet our operating requirements for the next twelve months our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our rate of revenue growth the expansion of our sales and marketing activities the timing and extent of expansion into new territories the timing of introductions of new products and enhancements of existing products the continuing market acceptance of our products and cash paid for future acquisitions 

obligations and commitments 

as of september 30 2022 we had approximately 697 million of tax liabilities including interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions see note 8 to our consolidated financial statements because of the high degree of uncertainty regarding the settlement of these liabilities we are unable to estimate the years in which future cash outflows may occur 

as of september 30 2022 our principal commitments consisted of borrowings under the term loan facility and obligations outstanding under operating leases 

in connection with the acquisition of shape on january 24 2020 we entered into a term credit agreement term credit agreement with certain institutional lenders that provides for a senior unsecured term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of 4000 million the term loan facility the proceeds from the term loan facility were primarily used to finance the acquisition of shape and related expenses as of september 30 2022  3500 million of principal amount under the term loan facility was outstanding there is a financial covenant that requires us to maintain a leverage ratio calculated as of the last day of each fiscal quarter of consolidated total indebtedness to consolidated ebitda this covenant may result in a higher interest rate on our outstanding principal borrowings on the term loan facility in future periods depending on the companys performance refer to note 6 of our consolidated financial statements for the scheduled principal maturities of the term loan facility as of september 30 2022 

we have a contractual obligation to purchase inventory components procured by our primary contract manufacturer in accordance with our annual build forecast the contractual terms of the obligation contain cancellation provisions which reduce our liability to purchase inventory components for periods greater than one year in order to support our build forecast we will from timetotime prepay our primary contract manufacturer for inventory purchases 

recently adopted accounting standards 

in october 2021 the fasb issued asu 202108 business combinations topic 805 accounting for contract assets and contract liabilities from contracts with customers the new guidance requires contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination to be recognized and measured by the acquirer on the acquisition date in accordance with asc 606 revenue from contracts with customers the company early adopted this accounting standard update beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 and it did not have a material impact on the companys consolidated financial statements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

interest rate risk our cash equivalents consist of highquality securities as specified in our investment policy guidelines the policy limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue or issuer to a maximum of 5 of the total portfolio with the exception of us treasury and agency securities and money market funds which are exempt from size limitation the policy requires investments in securities that mature in three years or less with the average maturity being no greater than one and a half years these securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if interest rates increase a hypothetical increase in interest rates of 100 basis points at september 30 2022 could result in a market value reduction for our portfolio of approximately 05 million 

inflation risk we are actively monitoring the current inflationary environment but we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business financial condition or results of operations if our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases our inability or failure to do so could harm our business financial condition and results of operations if the current inflationary environment constrains our customers’ ability to procure goods and services from us we may see customers reprioritize these investment decisions these macroeconomic conditions could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

foreign currency risk the majority of our sales cost of net revenues and operating expenses are denominated in us dollars and as a result we have not experienced significant foreign currency transaction gains and losses to date while we conduct transactions in foreign currencies and expect to continue to do so we do not anticipate that foreign currency transaction gains or losses will be significant at our current level of operations however as we continue to expand our operations internationally transaction gains or losses may become significant in the future

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the other information in this report the following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating our company and operations 

our business could be adversely impacted by conditions affecting the information technology market 

a substantial portion of our business depends on the demand for information technology by large enterprise customers and service providers in addition to the challenges presented by new cloud computing models we are dependent upon the overall economic health of our current and prospective customers and the continued growth and evolution of the internet international national regional and local economic conditions such as recessionary economic cycles protracted economic slowdown or further deterioration of the economy could adversely impact demand for our products demand for our products and services depends substantially upon the general demand for application delivery products and associated services which fluctuates based on numerous factors including capital spending levels and growth of our current and prospective customers as well as general economic conditions moreover the purchase of our products is often discretionary and may involve a significant commitment of capital and other resources future economic projections for the information technology sector are uncertain as companies continue to reassess their spending for technology projects and embrace new models for delivery of it services such as cloud computing and highly orchestrated software defined networking environments as a result spending priorities for our current and future customers may vary and demand for our products and services may be impacted in addition customer buying patterns are changing over time and more customers seek to rent software on a subscription basis and to reduce their total cost of ownership these evolving business models could lead to changes in demand and licensing strategies which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

cloudbased computing trends present competitive and execution risks 

customers are transitioning to a hybrid computing environment utilizing various cloudbased software and services accessed via various smart client devices pricing and delivery models are evolving and our competitors are developing and deploying cloudbased services for customers in addition new cloud infrastructures are enabling the emergence of new competitors including large cloud providers who offer their own application security and delivery functionality as well as smaller companies targeting the growing numbers of born in the cloud applications we are devoting significant resources to develop and deploy our own competing cloudbased software and services strategies while we believe our expertise and investments in software and infrastructure for cloudbased services provides us with a strong foundation to compete it is uncertain whether our strategies will attract the customers or generate the revenue required to be successful in addition to software development costs we are incurring costs to build and maintain infrastructure to support cloudcomputing services these costs may reduce the operating margins we have previously achieved whether we are successful in this new business model depends on our execution in a number of areas including 

• continuing to innovate and bring to market compelling cloudbased services that generate increasing traffic and market share 

• maintaining the utility compatibility and performance of our software on the growing array of cloud computing platforms and the enhanced interoperability requirements associated with orchestration of cloud computing environments and 

• implementing the infrastructure to deliver our own cloudbased services 

these new business models may reduce our revenues or operating margins and could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

industry consolidation may result in increased competition 

some of our competitors have made acquisitions or entered into partnerships or other strategic relationships to offer a more comprehensive solution than they had previously offered we have also entered into large strategic partnerships to enhance our competitive position in the marketplace as it companies attempt to strengthen or maintain their market positions in the evolving application delivery mobility cloud networking and cloud platform markets these companies continue to seek to deliver comprehensive it solutions to end users and combine enterpriselevel hardware and software solutions that may compete with our solutions and which could negatively impact our partnerships these consolidators or potential consolidators may have significantly greater financial technical and other resources than we do and may be better positioned to acquire and offer complementary products and services the companies resulting from these possible combinations may create more compelling product and service offerings and be able to offer greater pricing flexibility or sales and marketing support for such offerings than we can these heightened competitive pressures could result in a loss of customers or a reduction in our revenues or revenue growth rates all of which could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

we may not be able to compete effectively in the emerging application delivery and security market 

the markets we serve are new rapidly evolving and highly competitive and we expect competition to persist and intensify in the future as we expand our reach and role into a broader set of multicloud solutions the companies that we consider competitors evolves as well in addition to server load balancing traffic management and other functions normally associated with application delivery our suite of solutions has expanded our addressable market into security and policy management where we compete with a number of companies focused on niche areas of application security 

within application delivery we compete against citrix systems and a number of other competitors that have a smaller market presence or limited feature set such as amazon web services haproxy kemp technologies microsoft azure and vmware 

we see emerging demand to support modern containerbased applications with new capabilities including managing apis optimizing kubernetes traffic management and load balancing cloudnative and hybrid cloud applications for these use cases we compete against emerging players like apogee and kong 

in application security we compete with companies that provide web application firewalls bot detection and mitigation carriergrade firewall carriergrade nat ssl orchestration access policy management ddos protection and fraud defense competitors include akamai citrix systems imperva juniper networks and symantecblue coat with the addition of shape additional fraud abuse and analytics solutions become indirect competitors including akamai cloudflare imperva distil networks fastly signal sciences and perimeterx 

volterra’s use cases include multicloud networking as well as security offered as saas competing with the likes of imperva fastly akamai and cloudflare 

we expect to continue to face additional competition as new participants enter our markets as we continue to expand globally we may see new competitors in different geographic regions in addition larger companies with significant resources brand recognition and sales channels may form alliances with or acquire competing application services solutions from other companies and emerge as significant competitors potential competitors may bundle their products or incorporate an internet traffic management or security component into existing products in a manner that discourages users from purchasing our products any of these circumstances may limit our opportunities for growth and negatively impact our financial performance 

our success depends on our timely development of new products and features market acceptance of new product offerings and proper management of the timing of the life cycle of our products 

the markets for our products and services are characterized by 

• rapid technological change 

• evolving industry standards 

• consolidation of network and application functions into existing network infrastructure products 

• requirements that our products interoperate with those of other it vendors to enable ease of management 

• fluctuations in customer demand 

• changes in customer requirements and 

• frequent new product and service introductions and enhancements 

our continued success depends on our ability to identify and develop new products and new features for our existing products to meet the demands of these changes and the acceptance of those products and features by our existing and target customers in addition our products must interoperate with our end customers’ it infrastructure which often have different specifications deploy products from multiple vendors and utilize multiple protocol standards our customers’ it infrastructure is becoming more complex and we may be reliant on orchestration and interoperability with third party vendors on whom we are reliant for testing and support of new product versions and configurations if we are unable to identify develop and deploy new products and new product features on a timely basis our business and results of operations may be harmed 

the current development cycle for our products is on average 1224 months the introduction of new products or product enhancements may shorten the life cycle of our existing products or replace sales of some of our current products thereby offsetting the benefit of even a successful product introduction and may cause customers to defer purchasing our existing products in anticipation of the new products this could harm our operating results by decreasing sales increasing our inventory levels of older products and exposing us to greater risk of product obsolescence we have also experienced and may in the future experience delays in developing and releasing new products and product enhancements this has led to and may in the future lead to delayed sales increased expenses and lower quarterly revenue than anticipated also in the development of our products we have experienced delays in the prototyping of our products which in turn has led to delays in product introductions in addition complexity and difficulties in managing product transitions at the endoflife stage of a product can create excess inventory of components associated with the outgoing product that can lead to increased expenses any or all of the above problems could materially harm our business and results of operations 

our success depends on sales and continued innovation of our application security and delivery product lines 

we expect to derive a significant portion of our net revenues from sales of our application security and delivery product lines in the future implementation of our strategy depends upon these products being able to solve critical network availability performance and security problems for our customers if our products are unable to solve these problems for our customers or if we are unable to sustain the high levels of innovation in product feature sets needed to maintain leadership in what will continue to be a competitive market environment our business and results of operations will be harmed 

security vulnerabilities in our it systems or products as well as unforeseen product errors could have a material adverse impact on our business results of operations financial condition and reputation 

in the ordinary course of business we store sensitive data including intellectual property personal data our proprietary business information and that of our customers suppliers and business partners on our networks in addition we store sensitive data through cloudbased services that may be hosted by third parties and in data center infrastructure maintained by third parties the secure maintenance of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy our information systems and those of our partners and customers are subject to the increasing threat of intrusions by a wide range of actors including computer programmers hackers or sophisticated nationstate and nationstate supported actors or they may be compromised due to employee error or wrongful conduct malfeasance or other disruptions despite our security measures and those of our 

thirdparty vendors our information technology and infrastructure has experienced breaches or disruptions and may be vulnerable in the future to breach attacks or disruptions if any breach or attack compromises our networks creates system disruptions or slowdowns or exploits security vulnerabilities of our products the information stored on our networks or those of our customers could be accessed and modified publicly disclosed lost or stolen and we may be subject to liability to our customers suppliers business partners and others and suffer reputational and financial harm 

in addition our products are used to manage critical applications and data for customers and third parties may attempt to exploit security vulnerabilities in our products as well as our internal it systems as we continue to focus on the development and marketing of security solutions we become a bigger target for malicious computer hackers including sophisticated nationstate and nationstate supported actors who wish to exploit security vulnerabilities in our products or it systems 

we devote significant resources to addressing security vulnerabilities in our it systems product solutions and services through our efforts to engineer more secure solutions and services enhance security and reliability features in our solutions and services deploy security updates to address security vulnerabilities and seek to respond to known security incidents in sufficient time to minimize any potential adverse impact despite our efforts to harden our infrastructure and build secure solutions from time to time we experience attacks and other cyberthreats these attacks can seek to exploit among other things known or unknown vulnerabilities in technology included in our it infrastructure solutions and services while we have undertaken efforts to mitigate these vulnerabilities they could render our internal systems products and solutions and services susceptible to a cyberattack 

our products may also contain undetected errors or defects when first introduced or as new versions are released we have experienced these errors or defects in the past in connection with new products and product upgrades as our products and customer it infrastructures become increasingly complex customers may experience unforeseen errors in implementing our products into their it environments we expect that these errors or defects will be found from time to time in new or enhanced products after commencement of commercial shipments these problems may cause us to incur significant warranty and repair costs divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts and cause significant customer relations problems we may also be subject to liability claims for damages related to product errors or defects while we carry insurance policies covering this type of liability these policies may not provide sufficient protection should a claim be asserted a material product liability claim may harm our business and results of operations 

our products must successfully operate with products from other vendors as a result when problems occur in a network it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem the occurrence of software or hardware problems whether caused by our products or another vendor’s products may result in the delay or loss of market acceptance of our products the occurrence of any of these problems may harm our business and results of operations 

any errors defects or vulnerabilities in our products or it systems could result in 

• expenditures of significant financial and product development resources in efforts to analyze correct eliminate or workaround errors and defects or to address and eliminate vulnerabilities 

• remediation costs such as liability for stolen assets or information repairs or system damage 

• increased cybersecurity protection costs which may include systems and technology changes training and engagement of third party experts and consultants 

• increased insurance premiums 

• loss of existing or potential customers or channel partners 

• loss of proprietary information leading to lost competitive positioning and lost revenues 

• negative publicity and damage to our reputation 

• delayed or lost revenue 

• delay or failure to attain market acceptance 

• an increase in warranty claims compared with our historical experience or an increased cost of servicing warranty claims either of which would adversely affect our gross margins and 

• litigation regulatory inquiries or investigations that may be costly and harm our reputation 

we are dependent on various information technology systems and failures of or interruptions to those systems could harm our business 

many of our business processes depend upon our it systems the systems and processes of third parties and on interfaces with the systems of third parties for example our order entry system provides information to the systems of our contract manufacturers which enables them to build and ship our products if those systems fail or are interrupted or if our ability to connect to or interact with one or more networks is interrupted our processes may function at a diminished level or not at all this would harm our ability to ship products and our financial results may be harmed 

in addition reconfiguring our it systems or other business processes in response to changing business needs may be timeconsuming and costly to the extent this impacted our ability to react timely to specific market or business opportunities our financial results may be harmed 

our failure to adequately protect personal information could have a material adverse effect on our business 

a wide variety of local state national and international laws directives and regulations apply to the collection use retention protection disclosure transfer and other processing of personal data these data protection and privacyrelated laws and regulations continue to evolve and may result in everincreasing regulatory and public scrutiny and escalating levels of enforcement and sanctions and increased costs of compliance certain safeharbor exemptions upon which the company relies for data transfers have been challenged and may no longer be available to us in the future our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or to protect such data could result in enforcement action against us including fines imprisonment of company officials and public censure claims for damages by endcustomers and other affected individuals damage to our reputation and loss of goodwill both in relation to existing endcustomers and prospective endcustomers any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations financial performance and business changing definitions of personal data and personal information within the european union the united states and elsewhere especially relating to classification of ip addresses machine identification location data and other information may limit or inhibit our ability to operate or expand our business including limiting strategic partnerships that may involve the sharing of data the evolving data protection regulatory environment may require significant management attention and financial resources to analyze and modify our it infrastructure to meet these changing requirements all of which could reduce our operating margins and impact our operating results and financial condition 

our success depends on our key personnel and our ability to hire retain and motivate qualified executives sales and marketing operations product development and professional services personnel 

our success depends in large part on our ability to attract engage retain and integrate qualified executives and other key employees throughout all areas of our business in order to attract and retain executives and other key employees in a competitive marketplace we must provide a competitive compensation package including cash and equitybased compensation if we do not obtain the stockholder approval needed to continue granting equity compensation in a competitive manner our ability to attract retain and motivate executives and key employees could be weakened failure to successfully hire executives and key employees or the loss of any executives and key employees could have a significant impact on our operations we have recently experienced changes in our senior leadership team and we expect to continue to see changes as we build the team that is needed to execute our strategy changes in our management team may be disruptive to our business and any failure to successfully integrate key new hires or promoted employees could adversely affect our business and results of operations the complexity of our products and their integration into existing networks and ongoing support as well as the sophistication of our sales and marketing effort requires us to retain highly trained developers professional services customer support and sales personnel competition for qualified developers professional services customer support and sales personnel in our industry is intense especially in silicon valley and seattle where we have substantial operations and a need for highly skilled personnel because of the limited number of people available with the necessary technical skills and understanding of our products also to the extent we hire personnel from competitors we may be subject to allegations that they have been improperly solicited that they have divulged proprietary or other confidential information that they have violated noncompete obligations to their prior employers or that their former employers own their inventions or other work product our ability to hire and retain these personnel may be adversely affected by volatility or reductions in the price of our common stock or our ability to get approval from shareholders to offer additional common stock to our employees since these employees are generally granted restricted stock units the loss of services of any of our key personnel the inability to retain and attract qualified personnel in the future or delays in hiring qualified personnel may harm our business and results of operations in addition we recently announced a restructuring to realign our workforce to match strategic and financial objectives and optimize resources for long term growth including a reduction in force program impacting a number of employees this restructuring could lead to increased attrition amongst those employees who were not directly affected by the reduction in force program 

we recently implemented a restructuring program which we cannot guarantee will achieve its intended result 

in the first fiscal quarter of 2020 we completed a restructuring program to match strategic and financial objectives and optimize resources for long term growth we incur substantial costs to implement restructuring plans and our restructuring activities may subject us to litigation risks and expenses our past restructuring plans do not provide any assurance that additional restructuring plans will not be required or implemented in the future in addition our restructuring plans may have other consequences such as attrition beyond our planned reduction in workforce a negative effect on employee morale and productivity or our ability to attract highly skilled employees our competitors may also use our restructuring plans to seek to gain a competitive advantage over us as a result our restructuring plans may affect our revenue and other operating results in the future 

the average selling price of our products may decrease and our costs may increase which may negatively impact revenues and profits 

it is possible that the average selling prices of our products will decrease in the future in response to competitive pricing pressures increased sales discounts new product introductions by us or our competitors as well as the shift to more software consumption based and “as a service based” models or other factors therefore in order to maintain our profits we must develop and introduce new products and product enhancements on a timely basis and continually reduce our product costs our failure to do so could cause our revenue and profits to decline which would harm our business and results of operations in addition we may experience substantial periodtoperiod fluctuations in future operating results due to the erosion of our average selling prices 

our business may be harmed if our contract manufacturers are not able to provide us with adequate supplies of our products or if a single source of hardware assembly is lost or impaired 

we outsource the manufacturing of our hardware platforms to third party contract manufacturers who assemble these hardware platforms to our specifications we have experienced minor delays in shipments from contract manufacturers in the past however if we experience major delays in the future or other problems such as inferior quality and insufficient quantity of product any one or a combination of these factors may harm our business and results of operations the inability of our contract manufacturers to provide us with adequate supplies of our products or the loss of one or more of our contract manufacturers may cause a delay in our ability to fulfill orders while we obtain a replacement manufacturer and may harm our business and results of operations in particular we currently subcontract manufacturing of our products to a single contract manufacturer with whom we do not have a longterm contract if our arrangement with this single source of hardware assembly was terminated or otherwise impaired and we were not able to engage another contract manufacturer in a timely manner our business financial condition and results of operation could be adversely affected 

if the demand for our products grows we will need to increase our raw material and component purchases contract manufacturing capacity and internal test and quality control functions any disruptions in product flow may limit our revenue may harm our competitive position and may result in additional costs or cancellation of orders by our customers 

our business could suffer if there are any interruptions or delays in the supply of hardware components from our thirdparty sources 

we currently purchase several hardware components used in the assembly of our products from a number of single or limited sources lead times for these components vary significantly and are increasing in light of global shortages of critical components global supply chain constraints in the wake of the covid19 pandemic continue to decrease our visibility into component availability and lead times despite efforts to mitigate the effects of supply chain constraints the unavailability of suitable components any interruption or delay in the supply of any of these hardware components or the inability to procure a similar component from alternate sources at acceptable prices within a reasonable time may delay assembly and our ability to fulfill our sales of our products and hence our revenues and may harm our business and results of operations 

it is difficult to predict our future operating results because we have an unpredictable sales cycle 

our products have a lengthy sales cycle and the timing of our revenue is difficult to predict historically our sales cycle has ranged from approximately two to three months and has tended to lengthen as our products become increasingly complex also as our distribution strategy is focused on a channel model utilizing valueadded resellers distributors and systems integrators the level of variability in the length of sales cycle across transactions has increased and made it more difficult to predict the timing of many of our sales transactions sales of our products require us to educate potential customers in their use and benefits sales of our products are subject to delays from the lengthy internal budgeting approval and competitive evaluation processes that large enterprises and governmental entities may require for example customers frequently begin by evaluating our products on a limited basis and devote time and resources to testing our products before they decide whether or 

not to purchase customers may also defer orders as a result of anticipated releases of new products or enhancements by our competitors or us as a result our products have an unpredictable sales cycle that contributes to the uncertainty of our future operating results 

we may not be able to sustain or develop new distribution relationships and a reduction or delay in sales to significant distribution partners could hurt our business 

we sell our products and services through multiple distribution channels in the united states and internationally including leading industry distributors valueadded resellers systems integrators service providers and other indirect channel partners we have a limited number of agreements with companies in these channels and we may not be able to increase our number of distribution relationships or maintain our existing relationships recruiting and retaining qualified channel partners and training them in our technologies requires significant time and resources these channel partners may also market sell and support products and services that are competitive with ours and may devote more resources to the marketing sales and support of such competitive products our indirect sales channel structure could subject us to lawsuits potential liability and reputational harm if for example any of our channel partners misrepresent the functionality of our products or services to customers or violate laws or our corporate policies if we are unable to establish or maintain our indirect sales channels our business and results of operations will be harmed in addition two worldwide distributors of our products accounted for 303 of our total net revenue for fiscal year 2021 a substantial reduction or delay in sales of our products to these distribution partners if not replaced by sales to other indirect channel partners and distributors could harm our business operating results and financial condition 

a portion of our revenue is generated by sales to government entities which are subject to a number of challenges and risks 

sales to us and foreign federal state and local governmental agency endcustomers account for a significant portion of our revenues and we may in the future increase sales to government entities sales to government entities are subject to a number of risks selling to government entities can be highly competitive expensive and time consuming often requiring significant upfront time and expense without any assurance that these efforts will generate a sale the substantial majority of our sales to date to government entities have been made indirectly through our channel partners government certification requirements for products like ours may change thereby restricting our ability to sell into the federal government sector until we have attained the revised certification government demand and payment for our products and services may be impacted by public sector budgetary cycles and funding authorizations with funding reductions or delays adversely affecting public sector demand for our products and services government entities may have statutory contractual or other legal rights to terminate contracts with our distributors and resellers for convenience or due to a default and any such termination may adversely impact our future operating results governments routinely investigate and audit government contractors’ administrative processes and any unfavorable audit could result in the government refusing to continue buying our products and services a reduction of revenue or fines or civil or criminal liability if the audit uncovers improper or illegal activities which could adversely impact our operating results in a material way finally for purchases by the us government the government may require certain products to be manufactured in the united states and other relatively high cost manufacturing locations and we may not manufacture all products in locations that meet the requirements of the us government affecting our ability to sell these products to the us government 

misuse of our products could harm our reputation 

our products may be misused by endcustomers or third parties that obtain access to our products for example our products could be used to censor private access to certain information on the internet such use of our products for censorship could result in negative publicity and damage to our reputation in addition as many of our products are subject to export control regulations diversion of our products to restricted third parties by others could result in investigations penalties fines trade restrictions and negative publicity that could damage our reputation and materially impact our business operating results and financial condition 

our quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate in future periods which may cause our stock price to fluctuate 

our quarterly and annual operating results have varied significantly in the past and could vary significantly in the future which makes it difficult for us to predict our future operating results our operating results may fluctuate due to a variety of factors many of which are outside of our control including the changing and recently volatile us and global economic environment which may cause our stock price to fluctuate in particular we anticipate that the size of customer orders may increase as we continue to focus on larger business accounts a delay in the recognition of revenue even from just one account may have a significant negative impact on our results of operations for a given period in the past a majority of our sales have been realized near the end of a quarter accordingly a delay in an anticipated sale past the end of a particular quarter may 

negatively impact our results of operations for that quarter or in some cases that fiscal year additionally we have exposure to the credit risks of some of our customers and subtenants although we have programs in place that are designed to monitor and mitigate the associated risk there can be no assurance that such programs will be effective in reducing our credit risks adequately we monitor individual payment capability in granting credit arrangements seek to limit the total credit to amounts we believe our customers can pay and maintain reserves we believe are adequate to cover exposure for potential losses if there is a deterioration of a subtenant’s or a major customer’s creditworthiness or actual defaults are higher than expected future losses if incurred could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our operating results further our operating results may be below the expectations of securities analysts and investors in future quarters or years our failure to meet these expectations will likely harm the market price of our common stock such a decline could occur and has occurred in the past even when we have met our publicly stated revenue andor earnings guidance 

reliance on fulfillment at the end of the quarter could cause our revenue for the applicable period to fall below expected levels 

as a result of customer buying patterns and the efforts of our sales force and channel partners to meet or exceed their sales objectives we have historically received a substantial portion of sales orders and generated a substantial portion of revenue during the last few weeks of each fiscal quarter in addition any significant interruption in our information technology systems which manage critical functions such as order processing revenue recognition financial forecasts inventory and supply chain management and trade compliance reviews could result in delayed order fulfillment and decreased revenue for that fiscal quarter if expected revenue at the end of any fiscal quarter is delayed for any reason including the failure of anticipated purchase orders to materialize our third party contract manufacturers’ inability to manufacture and ship products prior to fiscal quarterend to fulfill purchase orders received near the end of the fiscal quarter our failure to manage inventory to meet demand our inability to release new products on schedule any failure of our systems related to order review and processing or any delays in shipments based on trade compliance requirements our revenue for that quarter could fall below our expectations resulting in a decline in the trading price of our common stock 

changes in financial accounting standards may cause adverse unexpected revenue fluctuations and affect our reported results of operations 

a change in accounting policies can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective new pronouncements and varying interpretations of existing pronouncements have occurred with frequency and may occur in the future changes to existing rules or changes to the interpretations of existing rules could lead to changes in our accounting practices and such changes could adversely affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business 

if we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting the accuracy and timeliness of our financial reporting may be adversely affected 

as a public company we are required to design and maintain proper and effective internal controls over financial reporting and to report any material weaknesses in such internal controls section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 requires that we evaluate and determine the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting and provide a management report on the internal controls over financial reporting which must be attested to by our independent registered public accounting firm we have an ongoing program to review the design of our internal controls framework in keeping with changes in business needs implement necessary changes to our controls design and test the system and process controls necessary to comply with these requirements if in the future our internal controls over financial reporting are determined to be not effective resulting in a material weakness investor perceptions regarding the reliability of our financial statements may be adversely affected which could cause a decline in the market price of our stock and otherwise negatively affect our liquidity and financial condition 

we may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities 

our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be affected by changes in our business operations including acquisitions new offerings and changes in the jurisdictions in which we operate the provision for income taxes may also be impacted by changes in stockbased compensation changes in the research and development tax credit laws earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and being higher than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates transfer pricing adjustments not meeting the terms and conditions of tax holidays or incentives changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in actual results versus our estimates or changes in tax laws regulations accounting principles or interpretations thereof including changes to the tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals our results of operations and cash flows could be affected by future guidance implementing the provisions of the tax cuts and jobs act in addition we may be subject to examination of our income tax 

returns by the us internal revenue service and other tax authorities while we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes from such examinations and the adequacy of our provision for income taxes there can be no assurance that such provision is sufficient and that a determination by a tax authority will not have an adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows 

we are subject to governmental export and import controls that could subject us to liability or impair our ability to compete in international markets 

our products are subject to us export controls and may be exported outside the us only with the required level of export license or through an export license exception because we incorporate encryption technology into our products in addition various countries regulate the import of certain encryption technology and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute our products or our customers’ ability to implement our products in those countries changes in our products or changes in export and import regulations may create delays in the introduction of our products in international markets prevent our customers with international operations from deploying our products throughout their global systems or in some cases prevent the export or import of our products to certain countries altogether any change in export or import regulations or related legislation shift in approach to the enforcement or scope of existing regulations or change in the countries persons or technologies targeted by such regulations could result in decreased use of our products by or in our decreased ability to export or sell our products to existing or potential customers with international operations any decreased use of our products or limitation on our ability to export or sell our products would likely adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property and our products may infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties 

we rely on a combination of patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure of confidential and proprietary information to protect our intellectual property rights despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology monitoring unauthorized use of our products is difficult and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of our technology particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 

our industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the ordinary course of our business we are involved in disputes and licensing discussions with others regarding their claimed proprietary rights and cannot provide assurance that we will always successfully defend ourselves against such claims and such matters are subject to many uncertainties and outcomes are not predictable with assurance we expect that infringement claims may increase as the number of products and competitors in our market increases and overlaps occur also as we have gained greater visibility market exposure and competitive success we face a higher risk of being the subject of intellectual property infringement claims if we are found to infringe the proprietary rights of others or if we otherwise settle such claims we could be compelled to pay damages or royalties and either obtain a license to those intellectual property rights or alter our products so that they no longer infringe upon such proprietary rights any license could be very expensive to obtain or may not be available at all or may require us to make royalty payments which could adversely affect gross margins in future periods the actual liability in any such matters may be materially different from our estimate if any which could result in the need to adjust the liability and record additional expenses similarly changing our products or processes to avoid infringing upon the rights of others may be costly or impractical in addition we have initiated and may in the future initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to determine the scope and validity of our proprietary rights or those of our competitors any of these claims whether claims that we are infringing the proprietary rights of others or vice versa with or without merit may be timeconsuming result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel or require us to cease using infringing technology develop noninfringing technology or enter into royalty or licensing agreements further our license agreements typically require us to indemnify our customers distributors and resellers for infringement actions related to our technology which could cause us to become involved in infringement claims made against our customers distributors or resellers any of the abovedescribed circumstances relating to intellectual property rights disputes could result in our business and results of operations being harmed 

we incorporate open source software into our products although we monitor our use of open source closely the terms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by us courts and there is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products we could also be subject to similar conditions or restrictions should there be any changes in the licensing terms of the open source software incorporated into our products in either event we could be required to seek licenses from third parties in order to continue offering our products to reengineer our products or to discontinue the sale of our products in the event reengineering cannot 

be accomplished on a timely or successful basis any of which could adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

many of our products include intellectual property licensed from third parties in the future it may be necessary to renew licenses for third party intellectual property or obtain new licenses for other technology these third party licenses may not be available to us on acceptable terms if at all the inability to obtain certain licenses or litigation regarding the interpretation or enforcement of license rights and related intellectual property issues could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition furthermore we license some third party intellectual property on a nonexclusive basis and this may limit our ability to protect our intellectual property rights in our products 

our operating results are exposed to risks associated with international commerce 

as our international sales increase our operating results become more exposed to international operating risks additionally our international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks including the following 

• greater difficulty in enforcing contracts and accounts receivable collection and longer collection periods 

• the uncertainty of protection for intellectual property rights in some countries 

• greater risk of unexpected changes in regulatory practices tariffs and tax laws and treaties 

• risks associated with trade restrictions and foreign legal requirements including the importation certification and localization of our products required in foreign countries 

• greater risk of a failure of foreign employees partners distributors and resellers to comply with both us and foreign laws including antitrust regulations the us foreign corrupt practices act and any trade regulations ensuring fair trade practices 

• heightened risk of unfair or corrupt business practices in certain geographies and of improper or fraudulent sales arrangements that may impact financial results and result in restatements of or irregularities in financial statements 

• increased expenses incurred in establishing and maintaining office space and equipment for our international operations 

• greater difficulty in recruiting local experienced personnel and the costs and expenses associated with such activities 

• management communication and integration problems resulting from cultural and geographic dispersion 

• fluctuations in exchange rates between the us dollar and foreign currencies in markets where we do business 

• economic uncertainty around the world including continued economic uncertainty as a result of sovereign debt issues in europe and 

• general economic and political conditions in these foreign markets 

in addition on january 31 2020 the united kingdom withdrew from the european union commonly referred to as brexit brexit could lead to economic and legal uncertainty including volatility in global stock markets and currency exchange rates and increasingly divergent laws regulations and licensing requirements any of these effects of brexit among others could adversely affect our operations and financial results 

we must hire and train experienced personnel to staff and manage our foreign operations to the extent that we experience difficulties in recruiting training managing and retaining an international staff and specifically staff related to sales management and sales personnel we may experience difficulties in sales productivity in foreign markets we also enter into strategic distributor and reseller relationships with companies in certain international markets where we do not have a local presence if we are not able to maintain successful strategic distributor relationships internationally or recruit additional companies to enter into strategic distributor relationships our future success in these international markets could be limited business practices in the international markets that we serve may differ from those in the united states and may require us in the future to include terms other than our standard terms in customer contracts we intend to continue expanding into international markets sales outside of the americas represented 440 and 440 of our net revenues for the fiscal years ended september 30 2021 and 2020 respectively 

these factors and other factors could harm our ability to gain future international revenues and consequently materially impact our business operating results and financial condition the expansion of our existing international operations and entry into additional international markets will require significant management attention and financial resources our failure to successfully manage our international operations and the associated risks effectively could limit the future growth of our business 

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates which could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our sales contracts are denominated in us dollars and therefore substantially all of our revenue is not subject to foreign currency risk however a strengthening of the us dollar could increase the real cost of our solutions to our end customers outside of the united states which could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results in addition an increasing portion of our operating expenses is incurred outside the united states is denominated in foreign currencies and is subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates if we become more exposed to currency fluctuations and are not able to successfully hedge against the risks associated with currency fluctuations our operating results could be adversely affected to date we have not entered into any hedging arrangements with respect to foreign currency risk or other derivative instruments 

changes in governmental regulations could negatively affect our revenues 

many of our products are subject to various regulations promulgated by the united states and various foreign governments including but not limited to environmental regulations and regulations implementing export license requirements and restrictions on the import or export of some technologies especially encryption technology changes in governmental regulation and our inability or failure to obtain required approvals permits or registrations could harm our international and domestic sales and adversely affect our revenues business and operations 

new regulations related to conflict minerals may force us to incur additional expenses and could limit the supply and increase the costs of certain metals and minerals used in the manufacturing of our products 

in august 2012 the sec adopted new requirements under the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 or the doddfrank act for companies that use certain minerals and derivative metals referred to as conflict minerals regardless of their country of origin in their products whether or not these products are manufactured by third parties the doddfrank act requires companies to perform due diligence and disclose whether or not such minerals originate from the democratic republic of congo or adjoining countries we filed a report on form sd with the sec regarding such matters on may 27 2021 these requirements could adversely affect the sourcing availability and pricing of minerals or metals used in the manufacture of our products and the numerous components that go into our products all of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results in addition we will incur additional costs to comply with the disclosure requirements including costs related to determining the source of any relevant minerals and metals used in our products we have a complex supply chain and many components are sourced through our contract manufacturer and we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins for these minerals and metals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement as a result we may face reputational challenges with our customers and other stakeholders and possible regulatory risk 

we face litigation risks 

we are a party to lawsuits in the normal course of our business litigation in general and intellectual property and securities litigation in particular can be expensive lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations moreover the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict responding to lawsuits has been and will likely continue to be expensive and timeconsuming for us an unfavorable resolution of these lawsuits could adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

acquisitions present many risks and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that are contemplated at the time of the transaction 

with respect to our past acquisitions as well as any other future acquisitions we may undertake we may find that the acquired businesses products or technologies do not further our business strategy as expected that we paid more than what the assets are later worth or that economic conditions change all of which may generate future impairment charges our acquisitions may be viewed negatively by customers financial markets or investors there may be difficulty integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired business and we may have difficulty retaining the key personnel of the acquired business we may have difficulty in integrating the acquired technologies or products with our existing product lines our ongoing business and management’s attention may be disrupted or diverted by transition or integration issues and the complexity of managing geographically and culturally diverse locations we may have difficulty maintaining uniform standards controls procedures and policies across locations we may experience significant problems or liabilities associated with product quality technology and other matters 

our inability to successfully operate and integrate newlyacquired businesses appropriately effectively and in a timely manner or to retain key personnel of any acquired business could have a material adverse effect on our ability to take 

advantage of further growth in demand for integrated traffic management and security solutions and other advances in technology as well as on our revenues gross margins and expenses 

antitakeover provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us 

our board of directors has the authority to issue up to 10000000 shares of preferred stock and to determine the price rights preferences privileges and restrictions including voting rights of those shares without any further vote or action by the shareholders the rights of the holders of common stock may be subject to and may be adversely affected by the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future the issuance of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a change of control of our company without further action by our shareholders and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of the holders of common stock further certain provisions of our bylaws including a provision limiting the ability of shareholders to raise matters at a meeting of shareholders without giving advance notice may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or management of our company which could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock similarly state antitakeover laws in the state of washington related to corporate takeovers may prevent or delay a change of control of our company 

our stock price could be volatile particularly during times of economic uncertainty and volatility in domestic and international stock markets 

our stock price has been volatile and has fluctuated significantly in the past the trading price of our stock is likely to continue to be volatile and subject to fluctuations in the future some of the factors that could significantly affect the market price of our stock include 

• actual or anticipated variations in operating and financial results 

• analyst reports or recommendations 

• rumors announcements or press articles regarding our competitors’ operations management organization financial condition or financial statements and 

• other events or factors many of which are beyond our control 

the stock market in general and the market for technology companies in particular have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations these fluctuations have often been unrelated or disproportionate to operating performance the fluctuations may continue in the future and this could significantly impact the value of our stock and your investment 

if securities or industry analysts publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business or discontinue publishing research about our business the price and trading volume of our securities could decline 

the trading market for our common stock is influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us our business our market or our competitors if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our common stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business the price of our securities would likely decline if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly demand for our securities could decrease which might cause the price and trading volume of our securities to decline 

we face risks associated with having operations and employees located in israel 

we have offices and employees located in israel as a result political economic and military conditions in israel directly affect our operations the future of peace efforts between israel and its arab neighbors remains uncertain there has been a significant increase in hostilities and political unrest in israel in the past year the effects of these hostilities and violence on the israeli economy and our operations in israel are unclear and we cannot predict the effect on us of further increases in these hostilities or future armed conflict political instability or violence in the region in addition many of our employees in israel are obligated to perform annual reserve duty in the israeli military and are subject to being called for active duty under emergency circumstances we cannot predict the full impact of these conditions on us in the future particularly if emergency circumstances or an escalation in the political situation occurs if many of our employees in israel are called for active duty for a significant period of time our operations and our business could be disrupted and may not be able to function at full capacity current or future tensions and conflicts in the middle east could adversely affect our business operating results financial condition and cash flows 

our business is subject to the risks of earthquakes fire power outages floods and other catastrophic events and to interruption by manmade problems such as terrorism 

a significant natural disaster such as an earthquake a fire a flood or a significant power outage could have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition we have an administrative and product development office and a third party contract manufacturer located in the san francisco bay area a region known for seismic activity in addition natural disasters could affect our supply chain manufacturing vendors or logistics providers’ ability to provide materials and perform services such as manufacturing products or assisting with shipments on a timely basis in the event our or our service providers’ information technology systems or manufacturing or logistics abilities are hindered by any of the events discussed above shipments could be delayed resulting in missed financial targets such as revenue and shipment targets for a particular quarter in addition cyberattacks acts of terrorism or other geopolitical unrest could cause disruptions in our business or the business of our supply chain manufacturers logistics providers partners or endcustomers or the economy as a whole any disruption in the business of our supply chain manufacturers logistics providers partners or endcustomers that impacts sales at the end of a fiscal quarter could have a significant adverse impact on our quarterly results all of the aforementioned risks may be further increased if the disaster recovery plans for us and our suppliers prove to be inadequate to the extent that any of the above should result in delays or cancellations of customer orders or the delay in the manufacture deployment or shipment of our products our business financial condition and operating results would be adversely affected 

climate change may have an impact on our business 

risks related to climate change are increasing in both impact and type of risk we believe there will not be significant nearterm impacts to our offices worldwide due to climate change but longterm impacts remain unknown however there may be business operational risk due to the significant impacts climate change could pose to our employees’ lives our supply chain or electrical power availability from climaterelated weather events in addition rapidly changing customer and regulatory requirements to reduce carbon emissions present a risk of loss of business if we are not able to meet those requirements 

the effects of a pandemic or widespread health epidemic such as the coronavirus outbreak could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

the covid19 pandemic has disrupted the us and global economies and put unprecedented strain on governments healthcare systems educational institutions businesses and individuals around the world the impact and duration of which is difficult to assess or predict it is especially difficult to predict the impact on the global economic markets which have been and will continue to be highly dependent upon the actions of governments businesses and other enterprises in response to the pandemic as well as the effectiveness of those actions 

while our analysis shows covid19 did not have a significant impact on our results of operations for the fiscal year ended september 30 2021 the impacts of the global pandemic on our business and financial outlook are currently unknown areas that may or may not be adversely disrupted or impacted by the covid19 pandemic include but are not limited to customer demand for our products and services reductions in customer spend delayed or the inability to collect from our customers disruptions to our supply chain that could result in delays shortages or increased costs of our products disruptions to our operations in servicing our customers as a result of working remotely or business location closures which all may adversely impact our business results of operations and overall financial performance in future periods 

in addition to other risks listed in this “risk factors” section factors that may affect our operating results include but are not limited to 

• fluctuations in demand for our products and services due to changing market conditions pricing conditions technology evolution seasonality or other changes in the global economic environment 

• changes or fluctuations in sales and implementation cycles for our products and services

issuer purchases of equity securities 

on october 31 2018 we announced that our board of directors authorized an additional 10 billion for our common stock share repurchase program this authorization is incremental to the existing 44 billion program initially approved in october 2010 and expanded in each fiscal year thereafter acquisitions for the share repurchase programs will be made from time to time in private transactions accelerated share repurchase programs or open market purchases as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements the programs can be terminated at any time 

on february 3 2021 the company entered into accelerated share repurchase asr agreements with two financial institutions under which the company paid an aggregate of 500 million the asr agreements were accounted for as two separate transactions 1 a repurchase of common stock and 2 an equitylinked contract on the companys own stock upon execution of the asr agreements the company received an initial delivery of 21 million shares for an aggregate price of 400 million based on the market price of 19491 per share of the companys common stock on the date of the transaction the initial shares received by the company were retired immediately upon receipt the equitylinked contract for the remaining 100 million representing remaining shares to be delivered by the financial institutions under the asr agreements was recorded to common stock as of march 31 2021 and was settled in the third quarter of fiscal 2021 with the company receiving 449049 additional shares which were retired immediately upon receipt the total asr resulted in a repurchase of 25 million shares of the companys common stock at a volume weighted average repurchase price less an agreed upon discount of 19990 per share the shares received by the company were retired accounted for as a reduction to stockholder’s equity in the condensed consolidated balance sheets and treated as a repurchase of common stock for purposes of calculating earnings per share the company was not required to make any additional cash payments or delivery of common stock to the financial institutions upon settlement of the agreements

our management team monitors and analyzes a number of key performance indicators in order to manage our business and evaluate our financial and operating performance on a consolidated basis those indicators include 

• revenues  approximately 48 of our fiscal year 2021 revenues were derived from sales of our application security and delivery products including our bigip appliances and viprion chassis and related software modules and our softwareonly virtual editions local traffic manager ltm dns services formerly global traffic manager advanced firewall manager afm and policy enforcement manager pem that leverage the unique performance characteristics of our hardware and software architecture and products that incorporate acquired technology including application security manager asm and access policy manager apm nginx plus and nginx controller shape defense and enterprise defense and the secure web gateway and silverline ddos and application security offerings which are sold to customers on a subscription basis approximately 52 of our fiscal year 2021 revenues were derived from the sales of global services including annual maintenance contracts training and consulting services we carefully monitor the sales mix of our revenues within each reporting period we believe customer acceptance rates of our new products and feature enhancements are indicators of future trends we also consider overall revenue concentration by customer and by geographic region as additional indicators of current and future trends we are also monitoring the uncertainty related to the impacts that the covid19 pandemic has on the global economy and our customer base 

• cost of revenues and gross margins we strive to control our cost of revenues and thereby maintain our gross margins significant items impacting cost of revenues are hardware costs paid to our contract manufacturers thirdparty software license fees softwareasaservice infrastructure costs amortization of developed technology and personnel and overhead expenses our margins have remained relatively stable however factors such as sales price product and services mix inventory obsolescence returns component price increases warranty costs and the uncertainty surrounding the covid19 pandemic and its potential impacts to our supply chain could significantly impact our gross margins from quarter to quarter and represent significant indicators we monitor on a regular basis 

• operating expenses operating expenses are substantially driven by personnel and related overhead expenses existing headcount and future hiring plans are the predominant factors in analyzing and forecasting future operating expense trends other significant operating expenses that we monitor include marketing and promotions travel professional fees computer costs related to the development of new products and provision of services facilities and depreciation expenses 

• liquidity and cash flows our financial condition remains strong with significant cash and investments the decrease in cash and investments for fiscal year 2021 was primarily due to 5000 million of cash required for the repurchase of shares under our accelerated share repurchase agreements and 4113 million in cash paid for the acquisition of businesses primarily volterra in the second quarter of fiscal 2021 the decrease in cash and investments for fiscal year 2021 was partially offset by cash provided by operating activities of 6452 million going forward we believe the primary driver of cash flows will be net income from operations we will continue to evaluate possible acquisitions of or investments in businesses products or technologies that we believe are strategic which may require the use of cash additionally on january 31 2020 we 

entered into a revolving credit agreement the revolving credit agreement that provides for a senior unsecured revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of 3500 million the revolving credit facility we have the option to increase commitments under the revolving credit facility from time to time subject to certain conditions by up to 1500 million as of september 30 2021 there were no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility and we had available borrowing capacity of 3500 million 

• balance sheet we view cash shortterm and longterm investments deferred revenue accounts receivable balances and days sales outstanding as important indicators of our financial health deferred revenues continued to increase in fiscal 2021 due to the growth of our subscriptions business including the acquired deferred revenue associated with the volterra acquisition our days sales outstanding for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021 was 45 days sales outstanding is calculated by dividing ending accounts receivable by revenue per day for a given quarter 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we believe that of our significant accounting policies which are described in note 1 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity accordingly these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 

revenue recognition on october 1 2018 we adopted the new revenue recognition standard by applying the modified retrospective approach to those contracts which were not completed as of october 1 2018 results for reporting periods beginning after october 1 2018 are presented under the new revenue recognition standard while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for the prior periods 

we sell products through distributors resellers and directly to end users revenue related to our contracts with customers is recognized by following a fivestep process 

• identify the contracts with a customer evidence of a contract generally consists of a purchase order issued pursuant to the terms and conditions of a distributor reseller or end user agreement 

• identify the performance obligations in the contract performance obligations are identified in our contracts and include hardware hardwarebased software softwareonly solutions cloudbased subscription services as well as a broad range of service performance obligations including consulting training installation and maintenance 

• determine the transaction price the purchase price stated in an agreed upon purchase order is generally representative of the transaction price we offer several programs in which customers are eligible for certain levels of rebates if certain conditions are met when determining the transaction price we consider the effects of any variable consideration 

• allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract the transaction price in a contract is allocated based upon the relative standalone selling price of each distinct performance obligation identified in the contract 

• recognize revenue when or as the entity satisfies a performance obligation we satisfy performance obligations either over time or at a point in time as discussed in further detail below revenue is recognized at the time the related performance obligation is satisfied by transferring control of promised products and services to a customer 

revenue is recognized net of any taxes collected which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities shipping and handling fees charged to our customers are recognized as product revenue in the period shipped and the related costs for providing these services are recorded as a cost of sale 

the following is a description of the principal activities from which we generate revenue 

product 

revenue from the sale of our hardware and perpetual software products is generally recognized at a point in time when the product has been fulfilled and the customer is obligated to pay for the product we also offer several products by subscription either through termbased license agreements or as a service through our cloudbased platform revenue for termbased license agreements is recognized at a point in time when we deliver the software license to the customer and the 

subscription term has commenced for our softwareasaservice offerings revenue is recognized ratably as the services are provided hardware including the software run on those devices is considered systems revenue perpetual or subscription software offerings that are deployed on a standalone basis along with software sold as a service are considered software revenue when rights of return are present and we cannot estimate returns revenue is recognized when such rights of return lapse payment terms to customers are generally net 30 days to net 60 days 

global services 

revenues for postcontract customer support pcs are recognized on a straightline basis over the service contract term pcs includes a limited period of telephone support updates repair or replacement of any failed product or component that fails during the term of the agreement bug fixes and rights to upgrades when and if available consulting services are customarily billed at fixed hourly rates plus outofpocket expenses and revenues are recognized as the consulting is completed similarly training revenue is recognized as the training is completed 

contract acquisition costs 

sales commissions earned by our sales force are considered incremental and recoverable costs of obtaining a contract with a customer sales commissions for initial service contracts and subscription offerings are deferred and then amortized as an expense on a straightline basis over the period of benefit which management has determined to be 45 years and 3 years respectively 

significant judgments 

we enter into certain contracts with customers including flexible consumption programs and multiyear subscriptions with nonstandard terms and conditions management exercises significant judgment in assessing contractual terms in these arrangements to identify and evaluate performance obligations management allocates consideration to each performance obligation based on relative fair value using standalone selling price and recognizes associated revenue as control is transferred to the customer 

business combinations our business combinations are accounted for under the acquisition method we allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values the excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets 

on january 22 2021 we completed our acquisition of volterra inc for a total purchase price of 4272 million of which approximately 595 million of finitelived developed technology was recorded management valued the developed technology using the relieffromroyalty method under the income approach management applied significant judgment in estimating the fair value of the acquired developed technology which involved the use of a significant assumption with respect to the royalty rate 

covid19 update 

management has prioritized a humanfirst approach to the covid19 pandemic for f5 this means ensuring the health and safety of employees their families and our communities further this approach extends to our customers as we look for ways that we can support their operations during this crisis 

while our analysis shows covid19 did not have a significant impact on our results of operations for the fiscal year ended september 30 2021 the impacts of the global pandemic on our business and financial outlook are currently unknown global supply chain constraints in the wake of the covid19 pandemic continue to decrease our visibility into component availability and lead times are increasing for critical components necessary for the assembly of our hardware products we are undertaking efforts to mitigate these supply chain constraints but unavailability of components may impact our ability to complete assembly of our hardware products thereby limiting our ability to fulfill our sales to our customers in addition we are conducting business with substantial modifications to employee travel employee work locations and virtualization or cancellation of certain sales and marketing events among other modifications we will continue to actively monitor the situation and may take further actions that alter our business operations as may be required by federal state or local authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees customers partners suppliers and stockholders it is not clear what the potential effects any such alterations or modifications may have on our business including the effects on our customers and prospects or on our financial results

cash from operations could be affected by various risks and uncertainties including but not limited to the effects of the covid19 pandemic and other risks detailed in part i item 1a titled “risk factors” however we anticipate our current cash cash equivalents and investment balances anticipated cash flows generated from operations and available borrowing capacity on the revolver credit facility will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs

shape’s technology platform enables generalized aipowered user analytics while shape has focused on using these capabilities to detect advanced fraud and abuse going forward the same technology is being integrated throughout f5 to create general aipowered user analytics capabilities within and beyond cybersecurity use cases 

service provider solutions 

bigip offerings also comprise our service provider solutions that address the complex requirements for enabling fast secure reliable communications among the elements of existing infrastructures such as 4glte and evolving to newly designed cloudnative 5g networks network functions virtualization nfv environments and edge computing 

in addition to the solutions described above f5 also offers solutions for fixed and mobile service provider customers to enable fast secure reliable communications in their networks these solutions include intelligent traffic management services to classify and manipulate network traffic to successfully manage and migrate to newer technologies such as ipv4 to ipv6 and 4g to 5g our carrierclass network firewall services are used to secure the gin6 interface secure signaling threats and iot 

applications and detect and mitigate ddos attacks our solutions are also used by our customers to secure complex signaling for mobility protocols like diameter sip and gtp as well as iot protocols all f5 software solutions can be delivered on dedicated f5 hardware as virtual network functions vnfs that can use f5 vnf manager or other industry solutions to deploy and manage vnf instances and are evolving as container network functions cnf 

competition 

as f5 expands its reach and role into a broader set of multicloud solutions the companies that we consider competitors changes too in addition to server load balancing traffic management and other functions normally associated with application delivery our suite of solutions has expanded our addressable market into security and policy management where we compete with a number of companies focused on niche areas of application security the ability to create customized programmable services eg using irules enables our customers and our partners to design solutions to problems for which there is no offtheshelf solution as a result we believe the traditional definitions of our market do not encompass all of the features functions and capabilities of our products or accurately represent the addressable market for our solutions 

within the more narrowly defined traditional adc market several companies sell server load balancing products and capabilities these include citrix systems radware and a number of other competitors that have a smaller market presence or limited feature set such as a10 networks amazon web services array networks barracuda networks haproxy kemp technologies microsoft azure and vmware 

in application security we compete with companies that provide web application firewalls bot detection and mitigation carriergrade firewall carriergrade nat ssl orchestration access policy management ddos protection and fraud defense competitors include a10 networks akamai cisco citrix systems imperva juniper networks radware and symantecblue coat with the addition of shape additional fraud abuse and analytics solutions become indirect competitors including akamai cloudflare imperva distil networks fastly signal sciences and perimeterx 

the principal competitive factors in the markets in which we compete include form factor consumption model ecosystem integrations features and performance customer support brand recognition scope of distribution and sales channels and pricing some of our competitors have already tried or plan to adopt aggressive pricing policies to gain market share however because f5 offers superior performance broad functionality including lighterweight options with nginx and f5 cloud services we believe that we can and will compete effectively against such pricing policies 

corporate functions 

customer services and technical support

members of all our engineering teams collaborate closely with one another to ensure the interoperability and performance of our solutions 

we believe that robust and constant innovation is a necessity for f5 so we are also innovating in new ways for more than a year now we have had dedicated teams focused on testing new disruptive innovations in technology business models or customer segments we expect innovations resulting from the work of these teams will be complementary to our goal of delivering the broadest and most consistent portfolio of solutions across cloud and onpremises environments 

we rely on a combination of patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights f5 holds 387 patents in the united states and has 44 international patents with applications pending for various aspects of our technology our future success depends in part on our ability to protect our proprietary rights to the technologies used in our principal products despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use trade secrets or other information that we regard as proprietary in addition the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights as fully as the laws of the united states any issued patent may not preserve our proprietary position and competitors or others may develop technologies similar to or superior to our technology our failure to enforce and protect our intellectual property rights could harm our business operating results and financial condition 

in addition to our own proprietary software we incorporate software licensed from several thirdparty sources into our products these are generally term licenses which may renew annually and that generally provide for certain rights and licenses to support our customers post termination while we may not be able to renew all of these licenses in the future we believe that alternative technologies for these licenses are available both domestically and internationally

distributors vars and msps  as a key component of our sales strategy we have established relationships with a number of large national and international distributors local and specialized distributors vars and msps we derive a majority of our product sales from vars and msps relying on our large distributors for fulfillment training and partner enablement 

our agreements with our channel partners are not exclusive and do not prevent them from selling competitive products these agreements typically have oneyear terms with no obligation to renew and typically do not provide for exclusive sales territories or minimum purchase requirements

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the other information in this report the following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating our company and operations 

our business could be adversely impacted by conditions affecting the information technology market 

a substantial portion of our business depends on the demand for information technology by large enterprise customers and service providers in addition to the challenges presented by new cloud computing models we are dependent upon the overall economic health of our current and prospective customers and the continued growth and evolution of the internet international national regional and local economic conditions such as recessionary economic cycles protracted economic slowdown or further deterioration of the economy could adversely impact demand for our products demand for our products and services depends substantially upon the general demand for application delivery products and associated services which fluctuates based on numerous factors including capital spending levels and growth of our current and prospective customers as well as general economic conditions moreover the purchase of our products is often discretionary and may involve a significant commitment of capital and other resources future economic projections for the information technology sector are uncertain as companies continue to reassess their spending for technology projects and embrace new models for delivery of it services such as cloud computing and highly orchestrated software defined networking environments as a result spending priorities for our current and future customers may vary and demand for our products and services may be impacted in addition customer buying patterns are changing over time and more customers seek to rent software on a subscription basis and to reduce their total cost of ownership these evolving business models could lead to changes in demand and licensing strategies which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

cloudbased computing trends present competitive and execution risks 

customers are transitioning to a hybrid computing environment utilizing various cloudbased software and services accessed via various smart client devices pricing and delivery models are evolving and our competitors are developing and deploying cloudbased services for customers in addition new cloud infrastructures are enabling the emergence of new competitors including large cloud providers who offer their own adc functionality as well as smaller companies targeting the growing numbers of born in the cloud applications we are devoting significant resources to develop and deploy our own competing cloudbased software and services strategies while we believe our expertise and investments in software and infrastructure for cloudbased services provides us with a strong foundation to compete it is uncertain whether our strategies will attract the customers or generate the revenue required to be successful in addition to software development costs we are incurring costs to build and maintain infrastructure to support cloudcomputing services these costs may reduce the operating margins we have previously achieved whether we are successful in this new business model depends on our execution in a number of areas including 

• continuing to innovate and bring to market compelling cloudbased services that generate increasing traffic and market share 

• maintaining the utility compatibility and performance of our software on the growing array of cloud computing platforms and the enhanced interoperability requirements associated with orchestration of cloud computing environments and 

• implementing the infrastructure to deliver our own cloudbased services 

these new business models may reduce our revenues or operating margins and could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

industry consolidation may result in increased competition 

some of our competitors have made acquisitions or entered into partnerships or other strategic relationships to offer a more comprehensive solution than they had previously offered we have also entered into large strategic partnerships to enhance our competitive position in the marketplace as it companies attempt to strengthen or maintain their market positions in the evolving application delivery mobility cloud networking and cloud platform markets these companies continue to seek to deliver comprehensive it solutions to end users and combine enterpriselevel hardware and software solutions that may compete with our solutions and which could negatively impact our partnerships these consolidators or potential consolidators may have significantly greater financial technical and other resources than we do and may be better positioned to acquire and offer complementary products and services the companies resulting from these possible combinations may create more compelling product and service offerings and be able to offer greater pricing flexibility or sales and marketing support for such offerings than we can these heightened competitive pressures could result in a loss of customers or a reduction in our revenues or revenue growth rates all of which could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

we may not be able to compete effectively in the emerging application services market 

the markets we serve are new rapidly evolving and highly competitive and we expect competition to persist and intensify in the future our principal competitors in the application services market include citrix systems inc radware ltd and a number of other competitors that have a smaller market presence or limited feature set such as a10 networks amazon web services haproxy microsoft azure and vmware 

in related markets we compete with companies such as the following 

• cisco juniper networks and a10 networks for carriergrade firewall capabilities 

• akamai imperva and citrix systems in the web application firewall market 

• cisco juniper networks and a10 networks in carrier grade nat 

• symantecblue coat and a10 networks in ssl orchestration 

• pulse security and ping identity for access policy manager 

we expect to continue to face additional competition as new participants enter our markets as we continue to expand globally we may see new competitors in different geographic regions in addition larger companies with significant resources brand recognition and sales channels may form alliances with or acquire competing application services solutions from other companies and emerge as significant competitors potential competitors may bundle their products or incorporate an internet traffic management or security component into existing products in a manner that discourages users from purchasing our products any of these circumstances may limit our opportunities for growth and negatively impact our financial performance 

our success depends on our timely development of new products and features market acceptance of new product offerings and proper management of the timing of the life cycle of our products 

the markets for our products and services are characterized by 

• rapid technological change 

• evolving industry standards 

• consolidation of network and application functions into existing network infrastructure products 

• requirements that our products interoperate with those of other it vendors to enable ease of management 

• fluctuations in customer demand 

• changes in customer requirements and 

• frequent new product and service introductions and enhancements 

our continued success depends on our ability to identify and develop new products and new features for our existing products to meet the demands of these changes and the acceptance of those products and features by our existing and target customers in addition our products must interoperate with our end customers’ it infrastructure which often have different specifications deploy products from multiple vendors and utilize multiple protocol standards our customers’ it infrastructure is becoming more complex and we may be reliant on orchestration and interoperability with third party vendors on whom we are reliant for testing and support of new product versions and configurations if we are unable to identify develop and deploy new products and new product features on a timely basis our business and results of operations may be harmed 

the current development cycle for our products is on average 1224 months the introduction of new products or product enhancements may shorten the life cycle of our existing products or replace sales of some of our current products thereby offsetting the benefit of even a successful product introduction and may cause customers to defer purchasing our existing products in anticipation of the new products this could harm our operating results by decreasing sales increasing our inventory levels of older products and exposing us to greater risk of product obsolescence we have also experienced and may in the future experience delays in developing and releasing new products and product enhancements this has led to and may in the future lead to delayed sales increased expenses and lower quarterly revenue than anticipated also in the development of our products we have experienced delays in the prototyping of our products which in turn has led to delays in product introductions in addition complexity and difficulties in managing product transitions at the endoflife stage of a product can create excess inventory of components associated with the outgoing product that can lead to increased expenses any or all of the above problems could materially harm our business and results of operations 

our success depends on sales and continued innovation of our application delivery controller and application security product lines 

we expect to derive a significant portion of our net revenues from sales of our application delivery controller adc and application security products in the future implementation of our strategy depends upon these products being able to solve critical network availability performance and security problems for our customers if our products are unable to solve these problems for our customers or if we are unable to sustain the high levels of innovation in product feature sets needed to maintain leadership in what will continue to be a competitive market environment our business and results of operations will be harmed 

security vulnerabilities in our it systems or products as well as unforeseen product errors could have a material adverse impact on our business results of operations financial condition and reputation 

in the ordinary course of business we store sensitive data including intellectual property personal data our proprietary business information and that of our customers suppliers and business partners on our networks in addition we store sensitive data through cloudbased services that may be hosted by third parties and in data center infrastructure maintained by third parties the secure maintenance of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy our information systems and those of our partners and customers are subject to the increasing threat of intrusions by a wide range of actors including computer programmers hackers or sophisticated nationstate and nationstate supported actors or they may be compromised due to employee error or wrongful conduct malfeasance or other disruptions despite our security measures and those of our thirdparty vendors our information technology and infrastructure has experienced breaches or disruptions and may be vulnerable in the future to breach attacks or disruptions if any breach or attack compromises our networks creates system disruptions or slowdowns or exploits security vulnerabilities of our products the information stored on our networks or those of our customers could be accessed and modified publicly disclosed lost or stolen and we may be subject to liability to our customers suppliers business partners and others and suffer reputational and financial harm 

in addition our products are used to manage critical applications and data for customers and third parties may attempt to exploit security vulnerabilities in our products as well as our internal it systems as we continue to focus on the development and marketing of security solutions we become a bigger target for malicious computer hackers including sophisticated nationstate and nationstate supported actors who wish to exploit security vulnerabilities in our products or it systems 

we devote significant resources to addressing security vulnerabilities in our it systems product solutions and services through our efforts to engineer more secure solutions and services enhance security and reliability features in our solutions and services deploy security updates to address security vulnerabilities and seek to respond to known security incidents in sufficient time to minimize any potential adverse impact despite our efforts to harden our infrastructure and build secure solutions from time to time we experience attacks and other cyberthreats these attacks can seek to exploit among other things known or unknown vulnerabilities in technology included in our it infrastructure solutions and services while we have undertaken efforts to mitigate these vulnerabilities they could render our internal systems products and solutions and services susceptible to a cyberattack 

our products may also contain undetected errors or defects when first introduced or as new versions are released we have experienced these errors or defects in the past in connection with new products and product upgrades as our products and customer it infrastructures become increasingly complex customers may experience unforeseen errors in implementing our products into their it environments we expect that these errors or defects will be found from time to time in new or enhanced products after commencement of commercial shipments these problems may cause us to incur significant warranty and repair costs divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts and cause significant customer relations problems we may also be subject to liability claims for damages related to product errors or defects while we carry insurance policies covering this type of liability these policies may not provide sufficient protection should a claim be asserted a material product liability claim may harm our business and results of operations 

our products must successfully operate with products from other vendors as a result when problems occur in a network it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem the occurrence of software or hardware problems whether caused by our products or another vendor’s products may result in the delay or loss of market acceptance of our products the occurrence of any of these problems may harm our business and results of operations 

any errors defects or vulnerabilities in our products or it systems could result in 

• expenditures of significant financial and product development resources in efforts to analyze correct eliminate or workaround errors and defects or to address and eliminate vulnerabilities 

• remediation costs such as liability for stolen assets or information repairs or system damage 

• increased cybersecurity protection costs which may include systems and technology changes training and engagement of third party experts and consultants 

• increased insurance premiums 

• loss of existing or potential customers or channel partners 

• loss of proprietary information leading to lost competitive positioning and lost revenues 

• negative publicity and damage to our reputation 

• delayed or lost revenue 

• delay or failure to attain market acceptance 

• an increase in warranty claims compared with our historical experience or an increased cost of servicing warranty claims either of which would adversely affect our gross margins and 

• litigation regulatory inquiries or investigations that may be costly and harm our reputation 

we are dependent on various information technology systems and failures of or interruptions to those systems could harm our business 

many of our business processes depend upon our it systems the systems and processes of third parties and on interfaces with the systems of third parties for example our order entry system provides information to the systems of our contract manufacturers which enables them to build and ship our products if those systems fail or are interrupted or if our ability to connect to or interact with one or more networks is interrupted our processes may function at a diminished level or not at all this would harm our ability to ship products and our financial results may be harmed 

in addition reconfiguring our it systems or other business processes in response to changing business needs may be timeconsuming and costly to the extent this impacted our ability to react timely to specific market or business opportunities our financial results may be harmed 

our failure to adequately protect personal information could have a material adverse effect on our business 

a wide variety of local state national and international laws directives and regulations apply to the collection use retention protection disclosure transfer and other processing of personal data these data protection and privacyrelated laws and regulations continue to evolve and may result in everincreasing regulatory and public scrutiny and escalating levels of enforcement and sanctions and increased costs of compliance certain safeharbor exemptions upon which the company relies for data transfers have been challenged and may no longer be available to us in the future our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or to protect such data could result in enforcement action against us including fines imprisonment of company officials and public censure claims for damages by endcustomers and other affected individuals damage to our reputation and loss of goodwill both in relation to existing endcustomers and prospective endcustomers any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations financial performance and business changing definitions of personal data and personal information within the european union the united states and elsewhere especially relating to classification of ip addresses machine identification location data and other information may limit or inhibit our ability to operate or expand our business including limiting strategic partnerships that may involve the sharing of data the evolving data protection regulatory environment may require significant management attention and financial resources to analyze and modify our it infrastructure to meet these changing requirements all of which could reduce our operating margins and impact our operating results and financial condition 

our success depends on our key personnel and our ability to hire retain and motivate qualified executives sales and marketing operations product development and professional services personnel 

our success depends in large part on our ability to attract engage retain and integrate qualified executives and other key employees throughout all areas of our business in order to attract and retain executives and other key employees in a competitive marketplace we must provide a competitive compensation package including cash and equitybased compensation if we do not obtain the stockholder approval needed to continue granting equity compensation in a competitive manner our ability to attract retain and motivate executives and key employees could be weakened failure to successfully hire executives and key employees or the loss of any executives and key employees could have a significant impact on our operations we have recently experienced changes in our senior leadership team and we expect to continue to see changes as we build the team that is needed to execute our strategy changes in our management team may be disruptive to our business and any failure to successfully integrate key new hires or promoted employees could adversely affect our business and results of operations the complexity of our products and their integration into existing networks and ongoing support as well as the sophistication of our sales and marketing effort requires us to retain highly trained developers professional services customer support and sales personnel competition for qualified developers professional services customer support and sales personnel in our industry is intense especially in silicon valley and seattle where we have substantial operations and a need for highly skilled personnel because of the limited number of people available with the necessary technical skills and understanding of our products also to the extent we hire personnel from competitors we may be subject to allegations that they have been improperly solicited that they have divulged proprietary or other confidential information that they have violated noncompete obligations to their prior employers or that their former employers own their inventions or other work product our ability to hire and retain these personnel may be adversely affected by volatility or reductions in the price of our common stock or our ability to get approval from shareholders to offer additional common stock to our employees since these employees are generally granted restricted stock units the loss of services of any of our key personnel the inability to retain and attract qualified personnel in the future or delays in hiring qualified personnel may harm our business and results of operations in addition we recently announced a restructuring to realign our workforce to match strategic and financial objectives and optimize resources for long term growth including a reduction in force program impacting a number of employees this restructuring could lead to increased attrition amongst those employees who were not directly affected by the reduction in force program 

we recently implemented a restructuring program which we cannot guarantee will achieve its intended result 

in the first fiscal quarter of 2020 we completed a restructuring program to match strategic and financial objectives and optimize resources for long term growth we incur substantial costs to implement restructuring plans and our restructuring activities may subject us to litigation risks and expenses our past restructuring plans do not provide any assurance that additional restructuring plans will not be required or implemented in the future in addition our restructuring plans may have other consequences such as attrition beyond our planned reduction in workforce a negative effect on employee morale and productivity or our ability to attract highly skilled employees our competitors may also use our restructuring plans to seek to 

gain a competitive advantage over us as a result our restructuring plans may affect our revenue and other operating results in the future 

the average selling price of our products may decrease and our costs may increase which may negatively impact revenues and profits 

it is possible that the average selling prices of our products will decrease in the future in response to competitive pricing pressures increased sales discounts new product introductions by us or our competitors as well as the shift to more software consumption based and “as a service based” models or other factors therefore in order to maintain our profits we must develop and introduce new products and product enhancements on a timely basis and continually reduce our product costs our failure to do so could cause our revenue and profits to decline which would harm our business and results of operations in addition we may experience substantial periodtoperiod fluctuations in future operating results due to the erosion of our average selling prices 

our business may be harmed if our contract manufacturers are not able to provide us with adequate supplies of our products or if a single source of hardware assembly is lost or impaired 

we outsource the manufacturing of our hardware platforms to third party contract manufacturers who assemble these hardware platforms to our specifications we have experienced minor delays in shipments from contract manufacturers in the past however if we experience major delays in the future or other problems such as inferior quality and insufficient quantity of product any one or a combination of these factors may harm our business and results of operations the inability of our contract manufacturers to provide us with adequate supplies of our products or the loss of one or more of our contract manufacturers may cause a delay in our ability to fulfill orders while we obtain a replacement manufacturer and may harm our business and results of operations in particular we currently subcontract manufacturing of our products to a single contract manufacturer with whom we do not have a longterm contract if our arrangement with this single source of hardware assembly was terminated or otherwise impaired and we were not able to engage another contract manufacturer in a timely manner our business financial condition and results of operation could be adversely affected 

if the demand for our products grows we will need to increase our raw material and component purchases contract manufacturing capacity and internal test and quality control functions any disruptions in product flow may limit our revenue may harm our competitive position and may result in additional costs or cancellation of orders by our customers 

our business could suffer if there are any interruptions or delays in the supply of hardware components from our thirdparty sources 

we currently purchase several hardware components used in the assembly of our products from a number of single or limited sources lead times for these components vary significantly the unavailability of suitable components any interruption or delay in the supply of any of these hardware components or the inability to procure a similar component from alternate sources at acceptable prices within a reasonable time may delay assembly and sales of our products and hence our revenues and may harm our business and results of operations 

it is difficult to predict our future operating results because we have an unpredictable sales cycle 

our products have a lengthy sales cycle and the timing of our revenue is difficult to predict historically our sales cycle has ranged from approximately two to three months and has tended to lengthen as our products become increasingly complex also as our distribution strategy is focused on a channel model utilizing valueadded resellers distributors and systems integrators the level of variability in the length of sales cycle across transactions has increased and made it more difficult to predict the timing of many of our sales transactions sales of our products require us to educate potential customers in their use and benefits sales of our products are subject to delays from the lengthy internal budgeting approval and competitive evaluation processes that large enterprises and governmental entities may require for example customers frequently begin by evaluating our products on a limited basis and devote time and resources to testing our products before they decide whether or not to purchase customers may also defer orders as a result of anticipated releases of new products or enhancements by our competitors or us as a result our products have an unpredictable sales cycle that contributes to the uncertainty of our future operating results 

we may not be able to sustain or develop new distribution relationships and a reduction or delay in sales to significant distribution partners could hurt our business 

we sell our products and services through multiple distribution channels in the united states and internationally including leading industry distributors valueadded resellers systems integrators service providers and other indirect channel partners we have a limited number of agreements with companies in these channels and we may not be able to increase our number of distribution relationships or maintain our existing relationships recruiting and retaining qualified channel partners and training them in our technologies requires significant time and resources these channel partners may also market sell and support products and services that are competitive with ours and may devote more resources to the marketing sales and support of such competitive products our indirect sales channel structure could subject us to lawsuits potential liability and reputational harm if for example any of our channel partners misrepresent the functionality of our products or services to customers or violate laws or our corporate policies if we are unable to establish or maintain our indirect sales channels our business and results of operations will be harmed in addition one worldwide distributor of our products accounted for 167 of our total net revenue for fiscal year 2020 a substantial reduction or delay in sales of our products to these distribution partners if not replaced by sales to other indirect channel partners and distributors could harm our business operating results and financial condition 

a portion of our revenue is generated by sales to government entities which are subject to a number of challenges and risks 

sales to us and foreign federal state and local governmental agency endcustomers account for a significant portion of our revenues and we may in the future increase sales to government entities sales to government entities are subject to a number of risks selling to government entities can be highly competitive expensive and time consuming often requiring significant upfront time and expense without any assurance that these efforts will generate a sale the substantial majority of our sales to date to government entities have been made indirectly through our channel partners government certification requirements for products like ours may change thereby restricting our ability to sell into the federal government sector until we have attained the revised certification government demand and payment for our products and services may be impacted by public sector budgetary cycles and funding authorizations with funding reductions or delays adversely affecting public sector demand for our products and services government entities may have statutory contractual or other legal rights to terminate contracts with our distributors and resellers for convenience or due to a default and any such termination may adversely impact our future operating results governments routinely investigate and audit government contractors’ administrative processes and any unfavorable audit could result in the government refusing to continue buying our products and services a reduction of revenue or fines or civil or criminal liability if the audit uncovers improper or illegal activities which could adversely impact our operating results in a material way finally for purchases by the us government the government may require certain products to be manufactured in the united states and other relatively high cost manufacturing locations and we may not manufacture all products in locations that meet the requirements of the us government affecting our ability to sell these products to the us government 

misuse of our products could harm our reputation 

our products may be misused by endcustomers or third parties that obtain access to our products for example our products could be used to censor private access to certain information on the internet such use of our products for censorship could result in negative publicity and damage to our reputation in addition as many of our products are subject to export control regulations diversion of our products to restricted third parties by others could result in investigations penalties fines trade restrictions and negative publicity that could damage our reputation and materially impact our business operating results and financial condition 

our quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate in future periods which may cause our stock price to fluctuate 

our quarterly and annual operating results have varied significantly in the past and could vary significantly in the future which makes it difficult for us to predict our future operating results our operating results may fluctuate due to a variety of factors many of which are outside of our control including the changing and recently volatile us and global economic environment which may cause our stock price to fluctuate in particular we anticipate that the size of customer orders may increase as we continue to focus on larger business accounts a delay in the recognition of revenue even from just one account may have a significant negative impact on our results of operations for a given period in the past a majority of our sales have been realized near the end of a quarter accordingly a delay in an anticipated sale past the end of a particular quarter may negatively impact our results of operations for that quarter or in some cases that fiscal year additionally we have exposure to the credit risks of some of our customers and subtenants although we have programs in place that are designed to monitor and mitigate the associated risk there can be no assurance that such programs will be effective in reducing our credit risks adequately we monitor individual payment capability in granting credit arrangements seek to limit the total credit to amounts 

we believe our customers can pay and maintain reserves we believe are adequate to cover exposure for potential losses if there is a deterioration of a subtenant’s or a major customer’s creditworthiness or actual defaults are higher than expected future losses if incurred could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our operating results further our operating results may be below the expectations of securities analysts and investors in future quarters or years our failure to meet these expectations will likely harm the market price of our common stock such a decline could occur and has occurred in the past even when we have met our publicly stated revenue andor earnings guidance 

reliance on fulfillment at the end of the quarter could cause our revenue for the applicable period to fall below expected levels 

as a result of customer buying patterns and the efforts of our sales force and channel partners to meet or exceed their sales objectives we have historically received a substantial portion of sales orders and generated a substantial portion of revenue during the last few weeks of each fiscal quarter in addition any significant interruption in our information technology systems which manage critical functions such as order processing revenue recognition financial forecasts inventory and supply chain management and trade compliance reviews could result in delayed order fulfillment and decreased revenue for that fiscal quarter if expected revenue at the end of any fiscal quarter is delayed for any reason including the failure of anticipated purchase orders to materialize our third party contract manufacturers’ inability to manufacture and ship products prior to fiscal quarterend to fulfill purchase orders received near the end of the fiscal quarter our failure to manage inventory to meet demand our inability to release new products on schedule any failure of our systems related to order review and processing or any delays in shipments based on trade compliance requirements our revenue for that quarter could fall below our expectations resulting in a decline in the trading price of our common stock 

changes in financial accounting standards may cause adverse unexpected revenue fluctuations and affect our reported results of operations 

a change in accounting policies can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective new pronouncements and varying interpretations of existing pronouncements have occurred with frequency and may occur in the future changes to existing rules or changes to the interpretations of existing rules could lead to changes in our accounting practices and such changes could adversely affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business 

if we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting the accuracy and timeliness of our financial reporting may be adversely affected 

as a public company we are required to design and maintain proper and effective internal controls over financial reporting and to report any material weaknesses in such internal controls section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 requires that we evaluate and determine the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting and provide a management report on the internal controls over financial reporting which must be attested to by our independent registered public accounting firm we have an ongoing program to review the design of our internal controls framework in keeping with changes in business needs implement necessary changes to our controls design and test the system and process controls necessary to comply with these requirements if in the future our internal controls over financial reporting are determined to be not effective resulting in a material weakness investor perceptions regarding the reliability of our financial statements may be adversely affected which could cause a decline in the market price of our stock and otherwise negatively affect our liquidity and financial condition 

we may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities 

our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be affected by changes in our business operations including acquisitions new offerings and changes in the jurisdictions in which we operate the provision for income taxes may also be impacted by changes in stockbased compensation changes in the research and development tax credit laws earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and being higher than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates transfer pricing adjustments not meeting the terms and conditions of tax holidays or incentives changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in actual results versus our estimates or changes in tax laws regulations accounting principles or interpretations thereof including changes to the tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals our results of operations and cash flows could be affected by future guidance implementing the provisions of the tax cuts and jobs act in addition we may be subject to examination of our income tax returns by the us internal revenue service and other tax authorities while we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes from such examinations and the adequacy of our provision for income taxes there can be no assurance that such provision is sufficient and that a determination by a tax authority will not have an adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows 

we are subject to governmental export and import controls that could subject us to liability or impair our ability to compete in international markets 

our products are subject to us export controls and may be exported outside the us only with the required level of export license or through an export license exception because we incorporate encryption technology into our products in addition various countries regulate the import of certain encryption technology and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute our products or our customers’ ability to implement our products in those countries changes in our products or changes in export and import regulations may create delays in the introduction of our products in international markets prevent our customers with international operations from deploying our products throughout their global systems or in some cases prevent the export or import of our products to certain countries altogether any change in export or import regulations or related legislation shift in approach to the enforcement or scope of existing regulations or change in the countries persons or technologies targeted by such regulations could result in decreased use of our products by or in our decreased ability to export or sell our products to existing or potential customers with international operations any decreased use of our products or limitation on our ability to export or sell our products would likely adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property and our products may infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties 

we rely on a combination of patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure of confidential and proprietary information to protect our intellectual property rights despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology monitoring unauthorized use of our products is difficult and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of our technology particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 

our industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the ordinary course of our business we are involved in disputes and licensing discussions with others regarding their claimed proprietary rights and cannot provide assurance that we will always successfully defend ourselves against such claims and such matters are subject to many uncertainties and outcomes are not predictable with assurance we expect that infringement claims may increase as the number of products and competitors in our market increases and overlaps occur also as we have gained greater visibility market exposure and competitive success we face a higher risk of being the subject of intellectual property infringement claims if we are found to infringe the proprietary rights of others or if we otherwise settle such claims we could be compelled to pay damages or royalties and either obtain a license to those intellectual property rights or alter our products so that they no longer infringe upon such proprietary rights any license could be very expensive to obtain or may not be available at all or may require us to make royalty payments which could adversely affect gross margins in future periods the actual liability in any such matters may be materially different from our estimate if any which could result in the need to adjust the liability and record additional expenses similarly changing our products or processes to avoid infringing upon the rights of others may be costly or impractical in addition we have initiated and may in the future initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to determine the scope and validity of our proprietary rights or those of our competitors any of these claims whether claims that we are infringing the proprietary rights of others or vice versa with or without merit may be timeconsuming result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel or require us to cease using infringing technology develop noninfringing technology or enter into royalty or licensing agreements further our license agreements typically require us to indemnify our customers distributors and resellers for infringement actions related to our technology which could cause us to become involved in infringement claims made against our customers distributors or resellers any of the abovedescribed circumstances relating to intellectual property rights disputes could result in our business and results of operations being harmed 

we incorporate open source software into our products although we monitor our use of open source closely the terms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by us courts and there is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products we could also be subject to similar conditions or restrictions should there be any changes in the licensing terms of the open source software incorporated into our products in either event we could be required to seek licenses from third parties in order to continue offering our products to reengineer our products or to discontinue the sale of our products in the event reengineering cannot be accomplished on a timely or successful basis any of which could adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

many of our products include intellectual property licensed from third parties in the future it may be necessary to renew licenses for third party intellectual property or obtain new licenses for other technology these third party licenses may not be 

available to us on acceptable terms if at all the inability to obtain certain licenses or litigation regarding the interpretation or enforcement of license rights and related intellectual property issues could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition furthermore we license some third party intellectual property on a nonexclusive basis and this may limit our ability to protect our intellectual property rights in our products 

our operating results are exposed to risks associated with international commerce 

as our international sales increase our operating results become more exposed to international operating risks additionally our international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks including the following 

• greater difficulty in enforcing contracts and accounts receivable collection and longer collection periods 

• the uncertainty of protection for intellectual property rights in some countries 

• greater risk of unexpected changes in regulatory practices tariffs and tax laws and treaties 

• risks associated with trade restrictions and foreign legal requirements including the importation certification and localization of our products required in foreign countries 

• greater risk of a failure of foreign employees partners distributors and resellers to comply with both us and foreign laws including antitrust regulations the us foreign corrupt practices act and any trade regulations ensuring fair trade practices 

• heightened risk of unfair or corrupt business practices in certain geographies and of improper or fraudulent sales arrangements that may impact financial results and result in restatements of or irregularities in financial statements 

• increased expenses incurred in establishing and maintaining office space and equipment for our international operations 

• greater difficulty in recruiting local experienced personnel and the costs and expenses associated with such activities 

• management communication and integration problems resulting from cultural and geographic dispersion 

• fluctuations in exchange rates between the us dollar and foreign currencies in markets where we do business 

• economic uncertainty around the world including continued economic uncertainty as a result of sovereign debt issues in europe and 

• general economic and political conditions in these foreign markets 

in addition in june 2016 voters in the united kingdom approved an advisory referendum to withdraw from the european union commonly referred to as brexit the uncertainty surrounding the terms of the united kingdoms withdrawal and its consequences may cause our customers to closely monitor their costs and reduce their spending on our products and services 

we must hire and train experienced personnel to staff and manage our foreign operations to the extent that we experience difficulties in recruiting training managing and retaining an international staff and specifically staff related to sales management and sales personnel we may experience difficulties in sales productivity in foreign markets we also enter into strategic distributor and reseller relationships with companies in certain international markets where we do not have a local presence if we are not able to maintain successful strategic distributor relationships internationally or recruit additional companies to enter into strategic distributor relationships our future success in these international markets could be limited business practices in the international markets that we serve may differ from those in the united states and may require us in the future to include terms other than our standard terms in customer contracts we intend to continue expanding into international markets sales outside of the americas represented 440 and 445 of our net revenues for the fiscal years ended september 30 2020 and 2019 respectively 

these factors and other factors could harm our ability to gain future international revenues and consequently materially impact our business operating results and financial condition the expansion of our existing international operations and entry into additional international markets will require significant management attention and financial resources our failure to successfully manage our international operations and the associated risks effectively could limit the future growth of our business 

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates which could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our sales contracts are denominated in us dollars and therefore substantially all of our revenue is not subject to foreign currency risk however a strengthening of the us dollar could increase the real cost of our solutions to our end customers outside of the united states which could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results in addition an 

increasing portion of our operating expenses is incurred outside the united states is denominated in foreign currencies and is subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates if we become more exposed to currency fluctuations and are not able to successfully hedge against the risks associated with currency fluctuations our operating results could be adversely affected to date we have not entered into any hedging arrangements with respect to foreign currency risk or other derivative instruments 

changes in governmental regulations could negatively affect our revenues 

many of our products are subject to various regulations promulgated by the united states and various foreign governments including but not limited to environmental regulations and regulations implementing export license requirements and restrictions on the import or export of some technologies especially encryption technology changes in governmental regulation and our inability or failure to obtain required approvals permits or registrations could harm our international and domestic sales and adversely affect our revenues business and operations 

new regulations related to conflict minerals may force us to incur additional expenses and could limit the supply and increase the costs of certain metals and minerals used in the manufacturing of our products 

in august 2012 the sec adopted new requirements under the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 or the doddfrank act for companies that use certain minerals and derivative metals referred to as conflict minerals regardless of their country of origin in their products whether or not these products are manufactured by third parties the doddfrank act requires companies to perform due diligence and disclose whether or not such minerals originate from the democratic republic of congo or adjoining countries we filed a report on form sd with the sec regarding such matters on may 29 2020 these requirements could adversely affect the sourcing availability and pricing of minerals or metals used in the manufacture of our products and the numerous components that go into our products all of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results in addition we will incur additional costs to comply with the disclosure requirements including costs related to determining the source of any relevant minerals and metals used in our products we have a complex supply chain and many components are sourced through our contract manufacturer and we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins for these minerals and metals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement as a result we may face reputational challenges with our customers and other stakeholders and possible regulatory risk 

we face litigation risks 

we are a party to lawsuits in the normal course of our business litigation in general and intellectual property and securities litigation in particular can be expensive lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations moreover the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict responding to lawsuits has been and will likely continue to be expensive and timeconsuming for us an unfavorable resolution of these lawsuits could adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

acquisitions present many risks and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that are contemplated at the time of the transaction 

with respect to our past acquisitions as well as any other future acquisitions we may undertake we may find that the acquired businesses products or technologies do not further our business strategy as expected that we paid more than what the assets are later worth or that economic conditions change all of which may generate future impairment charges our acquisitions may be viewed negatively by customers financial markets or investors there may be difficulty integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired business and we may have difficulty retaining the key personnel of the acquired business we may have difficulty in integrating the acquired technologies or products with our existing product lines our ongoing business and management’s attention may be disrupted or diverted by transition or integration issues and the complexity of managing geographically and culturally diverse locations we may have difficulty maintaining uniform standards controls procedures and policies across locations we may experience significant problems or liabilities associated with product quality technology and other matters 

our inability to successfully operate and integrate newlyacquired businesses appropriately effectively and in a timely manner or to retain key personnel of any acquired business could have a material adverse effect on our ability to take advantage of further growth in demand for integrated traffic management and security solutions and other advances in technology as well as on our revenues gross margins and expenses 

antitakeover provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us 

our board of directors has the authority to issue up to 10000000 shares of preferred stock and to determine the price rights preferences privileges and restrictions including voting rights of those shares without any further vote or action by the shareholders the rights of the holders of common stock may be subject to and may be adversely affected by the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future the issuance of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a change of control of our company without further action by our shareholders and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of the holders of common stock further certain provisions of our bylaws including a provision limiting the ability of shareholders to raise matters at a meeting of shareholders without giving advance notice may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or management of our company which could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock similarly state antitakeover laws in the state of washington related to corporate takeovers may prevent or delay a change of control of our company 

our stock price could be volatile particularly during times of economic uncertainty and volatility in domestic and international stock markets 

our stock price has been volatile and has fluctuated significantly in the past the trading price of our stock is likely to continue to be volatile and subject to fluctuations in the future some of the factors that could significantly affect the market price of our stock include 

• actual or anticipated variations in operating and financial results 

• analyst reports or recommendations 

• rumors announcements or press articles regarding our competitors’ operations management organization financial condition or financial statements and 

• other events or factors many of which are beyond our control 

the stock market in general and the market for technology companies in particular have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations these fluctuations have often been unrelated or disproportionate to operating performance the fluctuations may continue in the future and this could significantly impact the value of our stock and your investment 

if securities or industry analysts publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business or discontinue publishing research about our business the price and trading volume of our securities could decline 

the trading market for our common stock is influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us our business our market or our competitors if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our common stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business the price of our securities would likely decline if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly demand for our securities could decrease which might cause the price and trading volume of our securities to decline 

we face risks associated with having operations and employees located in israel

our management team monitors and analyzes a number of key performance indicators in order to manage our business and evaluate our financial and operating performance on a consolidated basis those indicators include 

• revenues  the majority of our revenues are derived from sales of our application delivery controller adc products including our bigip appliances and viprion chassis and related software modules and our softwareonly virtual editions local traffic manager ltm dns services formerly global traffic manager advanced firewall manager afm and policy enforcement manager pem that leverage the unique performance characteristics of our hardware and software architecture and products that incorporate acquired technology including application security manager asm and access policy manager apm nginx plus and nginx controller shape defense and enterprise defense and the secure web gateway and silverline ddos and application security offerings which are sold to customers on a subscription basis we also derive revenues from the sales of services including annual maintenance contracts training and consulting services we carefully monitor the sales mix of our revenues within each reporting period we believe customer acceptance rates of our new products and feature enhancements are indicators of future trends we also consider overall revenue concentration by customer and by geographic region as additional indicators of current and future trends we are also monitoring the uncertainty related to the impacts that the covid19 pandemic has on the global economy and our customer base 

• cost of revenues and gross margins we strive to control our cost of revenues and thereby maintain our gross margins significant items impacting cost of revenues are hardware costs paid to our contract manufacturers thirdparty software license fees softwareasaservice infrastructure amortization of developed technology and personnel and overhead expenses our margins have remained relatively stable however factors such as sales price product and services mix inventory obsolescence returns component price increases warranty costs and the uncertainty surrounding the covid19 pandemic and its potential impacts to our supply chain could significantly impact our gross margins from quarter to quarter and represent significant indicators we monitor on a regular basis 

• operating expenses operating expenses are substantially driven by personnel and related overhead expenses existing headcount and future hiring plans are the predominant factors in analyzing and forecasting future operating expense trends other significant operating expenses that we monitor include marketing and promotions travel professional fees computer costs related to the development of new products and provision of services facilities and depreciation expenses 

• liquidity and cash flows our financial condition remains strong with significant cash and investments the decrease in cash and cash equivalents for fiscal year 2020 was primarily due to 9556 million in cash paid for the acquisition of shape in the 

second quarter of fiscal 2020 as well as 1000 million of cash required for the repurchase of outstanding common stock under our share repurchase program in fiscal year 2020 and 599 million of capital expenditures related to the expansion of our facilities to support our operations worldwide as well as investments in information technology infrastructure and equipment purchases to support our core business activities going forward we believe the primary driver of cash flows will be net income from operations the decrease in cash and cash equivalents for fiscal year 2020 was partially offset by cash provided by operating activities of 6609 million and 4000 million in cash proceeds from the issuance of debt in connection with our acquisition of shape we will continue to evaluate possible acquisitions of or investments in businesses products or technologies that we believe are strategic which may require the use of cash additionally on january 31 2020 we entered into a revolving credit agreement the revolving credit agreement that provides for a senior unsecured revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of 3500 million the revolving credit facility we have the option to increase commitments under the revolving credit facility from time to time subject to certain conditions by up to 1500 million as of september 30 2020 there were no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility and we had available borrowing capacity of 3500 million 

• balance sheet we view cash shortterm and longterm investments deferred revenue accounts receivable balances and days sales outstanding as important indicators of our financial health deferred revenues continued to increase in fiscal 2020 due to the growth of our subscriptions business including the acquired deferred revenue associated with the shape acquisition our days sales outstanding for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020 was 43 days sales outstanding is calculated by dividing ending accounts receivable by revenue per day for a given quarter 

critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we believe that of our significant accounting policies which are described in note 1 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity accordingly these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 

revenue recognition on october 1 2018 we adopted the new revenue recognition standard by applying the modified retrospective approach to those contracts which were not completed as of october 1 2018 results for reporting periods beginning after october 1 2018 are presented under the new revenue recognition standard while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for the prior periods 

we sell products through distributors resellers and directly to end users revenue related to our contracts with customers is recognized by following a fivestep process 

• identify the contracts with a customer evidence of a contract generally consists of a purchase order issued pursuant to the terms and conditions of a distributor reseller or end user agreement 

• identify the performance obligations in the contract performance obligations are identified in our contracts and include hardware hardwarebased software softwareonly solutions cloudbased subscription services as well as a broad range of service performance obligations including consulting training installation and maintenance 

• determine the transaction price the purchase price stated in an agreed upon purchase order is generally representative of the transaction price we offer several programs in which customers are eligible for certain levels of rebates if certain conditions are met when determining the transaction price we consider the effects of any variable consideration 

• allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract the transaction price in a contract is allocated based upon the relative standalone selling price of each distinct performance obligation identified in the contract 

• recognize revenue when or as the entity satisfies a performance obligation we satisfy performance obligations either over time or at a point in time as discussed in further detail below revenue is recognized at the time the related performance obligation is satisfied by transferring control of promised products and services to a customer 

the following is a description of the principal activities from which we generate revenue 

product 

revenue from the sale of our hardware and perpetual software products is generally recognized at a point in time when the product has been fulfilled and the customer is obligated to pay for the product we also offer several products by subscription either through termbased license agreements or as a service through our cloudbased platform revenue for termbased license agreements is recognized at a point in time when we deliver the software license to the customer and the subscription term has commenced for our softwareasaservice offerings revenue is recognized ratably as the services are provided hardware including the software run on those devices is considered systems revenue perpetual or subscription software offerings that are deployed on a standalone basis along with software sold as a service are considered software revenue when rights of return are present and we cannot estimate returns revenue is recognized when such rights of return lapse payment terms to customers are generally net 30 days to net 60 days 

services 

revenues for postcontract customer support pcs are recognized on a straightline basis over the service contract term pcs includes a limited period of telephone support updates repair or replacement of any failed product or component that fails during the term of the agreement bug fixes and rights to upgrades when and if available consulting services are customarily billed at fixed hourly rates plus outofpocket expenses and revenues are recognized as the consulting is completed similarly training revenue is recognized as the training is completed 

contract acquisition costs 

sales commissions earned by our sales force are considered incremental and recoverable costs of obtaining a contract with a customer sales commissions for initial service contracts and subscription offerings are deferred and then amortized as an expense on a straightline basis over the period of benefit which management has determined to be 45 years and 3 years respectively 

significant judgments 

we enter into certain contracts with customers including enterprise license arrangements with nonstandard terms and conditions management exercises significant judgment in assessing contractual terms in these arrangements to identify and evaluate performance obligations and total consideration management allocates consideration to each performance obligation based on relative fair value using standalone selling price and recognizes associated revenue as control is transferred to the customer 

business combinations our business combinations are accounted for under the acquisition method we allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values the excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets 

on january 24 2020 we completed our acquisition of shape security inc for a total purchase price of 10 billion of which approximately 1200 million of finitelived developed technology was recorded management valued the developed technology using the multiperiod excess earnings method under the income approach management applied significant judgment in estimating the fair value of the acquired developed technology which involved the use of a significant assumption with respects to the revenue growth rate and technology migration curve 

covid19 update 

management has prioritized a humanfirst approach to the covid19 pandemic for f5 this means ensuring the health and safety of employees their families and our communities further this approach extends to our customers as we look for ways that we can support their operations during this crisis 

while our analysis shows covid19 did not have a significant impact on our results of operations for the fiscal year ended september 30 2020 the impacts of the global pandemic on our business and financial outlook are currently unknown we are conducting business with substantial modifications to employee travel employee work locations and virtualization or cancellation of certain sales and marketing events among other modifications we will continue to actively monitor the situation and may take further actions that alter our business operations as may be required by federal state or local authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees customers partners suppliers and stockholders it is not clear what the potential effects any such alterations or modifications may have on our business including the effects on our customers and prospects or on our financial results

cash from operations could be affected by various risks and uncertainties including but not limited to the effects of the covid19 pandemic and other risks detailed in part i item 1a titled “risk factors” however we anticipate our current cash cash equivalents and investment balances anticipated cash flows generated from operations and available borrowing capacity on the revolver credit facility will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs 

cash used in investing activities during fiscal year 2020 was 7470 million compared to cash used in investing activities of 4146 million in fiscal year 2019 and cash used in investing activities of 4560 million in fiscal year 2018 cash used in investing activities for fiscal year 2020 was primarily the result of 9556 million in cash paid for the acquisition of shape along with capital expenditures related to maintaining our operations worldwide and the purchase of investments partially offset by the maturity and sale of investments cash used in investing activities for fiscal year 2019 was primarily the result of 6116 million in cash paid for the acquisition of nginx along with capital expenditures related to the buildout of our new corporate headquarters and the purchase of investments partially offset by the maturity and sale of investments cash used in investing activities for fiscal year 2018 was primarily the result of the purchase of investments and capital expenditures related to maintaining our operations worldwide partially offset by the sale and maturity of investments 

cash provided by financing activities was 3372 million for fiscal year 2020 compared to cash used in financing activities of 1554 million for fiscal year 2019 and 5513 million for fiscal year 2018 cash provided by financing activities for fiscal year 2020 included 4000 million in cash proceeds from a term loan as well as cash received from the exercise of employee stock options and stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan of 528 million partially offset by 1000 million in cash used to repurchase common stock under our share repurchase program and 100 million in cash used to make a principal payment on our term loan cash used in financing activities for fiscal year 2019 included 2010 million to 

repurchase common stock under our share repurchase program which was partially offset by cash received from the exercise of employee stock options and stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan of 456 million cash used in financing activities for fiscal year 2018 included 6001 million to repurchase common stock under our share repurchase program which was partially offset by cash received from the exercise of employee stock options and stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan of 488 million 

on january 31 2020 we entered into a revolving credit agreement the revolving credit agreement that provides for a senior unsecured revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of 3500 million the revolving credit facility we have the option to increase commitments under the revolving credit facility from time to time subject to certain conditions by up to 1500 million as of september 30 2020 there were no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility and we had available borrowing capacity of 3500 million 

based on our current operating and capital expenditure forecasts we believe that our existing cash and investment balances together with cash generated from operations should be sufficient to meet our operating requirements for the next twelve months our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our rate of revenue growth the expansion of our sales and marketing activities the timing and extent of expansion into new territories the timing of introductions of new products and enhancements of existing products the continuing market acceptance of our products and cash paid for future acquisitions 

obligations and commitments 

as of september 30 2020 we had approximately 548 million of tax liabilities including interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions see note 9 to our consolidated financial statements because of the high degree of uncertainty regarding the settlement of these liabilities we are unable to estimate the years in which future cash outflows may occur 

as of september 30 2020 our principal commitments consisted of borrowings under the term loan facility and obligations outstanding under operating leases 

in connection with the acquisition of shape on january 24 2020 we entered into a term credit agreement term credit agreement with certain institutional lenders that provides for a senior unsecured term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of 4000 million the term loan facility the proceeds from the term loan facility were primarily used to finance the acquisition of shape and related expenses as of september 30 2020  3900 million of principal amount under the term loan facility was outstanding there is a financial covenant that requires us to maintain a leverage ratio calculated as of the last day of each fiscal quarter of consolidated total indebtedness to consolidated ebitda this covenant may result in a higher interest rate on our outstanding principal borrowings on the term loan facility in future periods depending on the companys performance we will monitor the effect that the covid19 pandemic may have on our leverage ratio calculation but do not believe there will be a material impact to the interest payable on our borrowings under the term loan facility refer to note 7 of our consolidated financial statements for the scheduled principal maturities of the term loan facility as of september 30 2020 

we outsource the manufacturing of our preconfigured hardware platforms to contract manufacturers who assemble each product to our specifications our agreement with our largest contract manufacturer allows them to procure component inventory on our behalf based upon a rolling production forecast we are contractually obligated to purchase the component inventory in accordance with the forecast unless we give notice of order cancellation in advance of applicable lead times 

recently adopted accounting standards 

in may 2014 the fasb issued asu 201409 revenue from contracts with customers topic 606 asu 201409 asu 201409 and the related amendments outline a new single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance including industryspecific guidance the new model requires revenue recognition to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration a company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services we adopted this new accounting standard and the related amendments on october 1 2018 using the modified retrospective method refer to note 2  revenue from contracts with customers for further discussion 

in february 2016 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued asu 201602 leases topic 842 asu 201602 which requires lessees to recognize on the balance sheet a rightofuse asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term and a corresponding lease liability for all leases with terms greater than twelve months our leases consist primarily of operating leases for our offices and lab spaces we do not have finance leases the guidance also requires qualitative and quantitative disclosures designed to assess the amount timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases we adopted this standard on october 1 2019 on a modified retrospective basis by applying the new standard to our lease portfolio as of october 1 2019 under the modified retrospective method financial results reported in periods prior to fiscal 2020 are unchanged as a result of the adoption of this standard we recognized lease liabilities and corresponding rightofuse assets for our longterm leases for office space which had a material impact to our consolidated balance sheets the adoption of this standard had no impact on the consolidated income statements and consolidated statements of cash flows refer to note 8  leases for further discussion 

upon adoption of the standard we elected the package of three practical expedients for existing and expired contracts to not reassess the existence of additional leases lease classification or the treatment of initial direct costs we also apply the shortterm lease exemption for leases with an original expected term of 12 months or less and expense such leases monthtomonth and do not record a rightofuse asset or lease liability shortterm lease activity under the exception is not significant additionally we do not separate lease and nonlease components in the allocation of minimum lease payments for our office space and equipment leases as such separation is not significant 

we include in minimum lease payments fixed and variable payments based on a rate or index but exclude variable payments based on satisfying future benchmarks or actual future costs incurred such amounts are expensed as incurred to calculate the net present value we apply an incremental borrowing rate this incremental borrowing rate is determined using a portfolio approach based on the rate of interest we would pay to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments on a collateralized basis over a similar term renewal options to extend lease terms are excluded from the minimum lease term at lease commencement 

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

in june 2016 the fasb issued asu 201613 financial instruments  credit losses topic 326 measurement of credit losses on financial instruments asu 201613 which modifies the accounting for credit losses for most financial assets and requires the use of an expected loss model replacing the currently used incurred loss method under this model entities will be required to estimate the lifetime expected credit loss on such instruments and record an allowance to offset the amortized cost basis of the financial asset resulting in a net presentation of the amount expected to be collected on the financial asset the new standard is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after december 15 2019 early adoption is permitted we do not anticipate that the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

in august 2018 the fasb issued asu 201815 intangibles  goodwill and other  internaluse software subtopic 35040 asu 201815 which aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internaluse software and hosting arrangements that include an internal use software license the accounting for the service element of a hosting arrangement that is a service contract is not affected by the amendments in this update the new standard is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after december 15 2019 early adoption is permitted we do not anticipate that the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

interest rate risk our cash equivalents consist of highquality securities as specified in our investment policy guidelines the policy limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue or issuer to a maximum of 5 of the total portfolio with the exception of us treasury and agency securities and money market funds which are exempt from size limitation the policy requires investments in securities that mature in three years or less with the average maturity being no greater than one and a half years these securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if interest rates increase a decrease of one percent in the average interest rate would have resulted in a decrease of approximately 23 million in our interest income for the fiscal year 2020 

  



foreign currency risk the majority of our sales and expenses are denominated in us dollars and as a result we have not experienced significant foreign currency transaction gains and losses to date while we have conducted some transactions in foreign currencies during the fiscal year ended 2020 and expect to continue to do so we do not anticipate that foreign currency transaction gains or losses will be significant at our current level of operations however as we continue to expand our operations internationally transaction gains or losses may become significant in the future we have not engaged in foreign currency hedging to date however we may do so in the future

our enterprisegrade application services are available as cloudbased softwareasaservice and softwareonly solutions optimized for multicloud environments with modules that can run independently or as part of an integrated solution on our highperformance appliances in connection with our solutions we offer a broad range of professional services including consulting training installation maintenance and other technical support services 

on may 8 2019 we completed the acquisition of nginx inc nginx the open source leader in application delivery for modern applications nginx is the world’s leading web server by market share powering more than 400 million websites the acquisition enables f5 to offer multicloud application services across a broader range of environments than either company could have addressed independently providing the easeofuse and flexibility developers require while also delivering the scale security reliability and enterprise readiness it operations teams demand 

our customers include large enterprise businesses public sector institutions governments and service providers we conduct our business globally and manage our business by geography our business is organized into the following three geographic regions americas europe middle east and africa emea and asia pacific china and japan apac 

total revenue in fiscal year 2019 increased 4 to 2242 million total revenue is comprised of services revenue of 1257 million and product revenue of 986 million while the majority of our product revenue today is derived from appliance sales we are actively managing a transformation to a software and saasdriven business with software revenue growing 60 in fiscal year 2019 

at the end of fiscal years 2019 and 2018 we had product backlog of approximately 174 million and 305 million respectively backlog represents orders confirmed with a purchase order for products to be shipped generally within 90 days to customers with approved credit status orders are subject to cancellation rescheduling by customers or product specification changes by customers although we believe that the backlog orders are firm purchase orders may be canceled by the customer 

prior to shipment without significant penalty for this reason we believe that our product backlog at any given date is not a reliable indicator of future revenues

strategy and priorities 

f5 is at an inflection point moving from a hardwarecentric adc leader to a multicloud application services leader that helps over 25000 enterprise customers with their digital transformations enabling them to be more applicationcentric and decreasing the time it takes to bring an application to market f5 is uniquely positioned to offer an application services architecture that spans from code creation to end user making it possible for our customers to develop and deploy their applications in days instead of months securely and at scale across any environment 

idc estimates there were over 314 million enterprise application workloads in the world in 2018 and forecasts that number to grow to approximately 18 billion by 2023 while the number of applications is growing 5x the complexity of deploying managing and securing these applications is increasing with enterprises embracing new highly distributed architectures and multicloud environments simultaneously the risk of cyberattacks is increasing with the majority of threats targeting applications or the identity of the person accessing that application 

our goal is to lead the industry in providing application services that ensure the secure fast and reliable delivery of applications to any user anywhere anytime  regardless of a users location or where the application resides these application services include availability security performance and visibility they also include managing and orchestrating resources as well as coordinating services across multiple data centers networks and cloudbased resources 

key components of our strategy include 

expanding our addressable market by being multiplatform and multicloud while expanding the value we deliver with a growing range of application services 

today our platform reach extends across all the different ways that customers want to consume application services in addition to our hardware appliances and softwarebased virtual editions f5 application services can also be consumed via standalone software on a perapplication basis via a saas model and as a managed service these deployment models mean that f5 services can follow the application wherever it resides whether in a private data center a private cloud a public cloud microservices environments or across a multicloud environment 

we also continue to expand the number of services we offer we have developed a portfolio of application services that extends beyond our industryleading traffic management capabilities to encompass advanced security functionality including web application firewall waf antibot access management ssl termination and orchestration layer4 firewall and ddos protection we are also investing heavily in services that increase application portfolio visibility as well as services to help customers increase the value of their applications by extracting data and insights via an analytics engine 

our multifaceted approach addresses the needs of today’s evolving hybrid infrastructures and sharply differentiates our products from our competitors’ offerings moreover in step with our product development efforts and acquisition strategies we believe our current addressable market is significantly broader and more diverse than the adc market as industry analysts have defined it 

investing in technology to meet evolving customer needs 

we meet with our customers often and maintain multiple customer advisory relationships to ensure that our development efforts are aligned with their needs we continue to invest in research and development efforts that leverage the unique attributes of our traffic management operating system tmos platform as well as new technologies to deliver new features and functions that address the complex changing needs of our customers the majority of our investment is related to software development though we continue concurrent development of tightly integrated hardware that delivers consistent highperformance we also look for opportunities to acquire technologies that either extend our reach to new applications or expand our role in developing deploying operating securing and governing those applications nginx for example extends our reach to cloudnative and microservices environments and extends our role into application servers web servers and api gateways 

continuing to build and expand relationships with strategic technology partners 

f5 works with many of the world’s leading technology companies to improve manageability enable automation strengthen security and ensure faster and more successful deployments joint customers benefit from the integration and interoperability that result from this close collaboration in recent years we have developed partnerships with leading public cloud providers such as amazon web services microsoft azure google cloud platform and alibaba cloud we continue to partner with and build integrations for equinix cisco dell fireeye ibmred hat okta and vmware 

enabling modern devops practices is critical for our customers practicing agile development and accelerating applications’ time to market f5 integrates into automation toolkits for deploying application services into ansible hashicorpterraform chef puppet and salt stack for microservices in container environments f5 integrates with kubernetes and red hat openshift to enable application services in northsouth traffic enhances basic kubernetes environments natively with 

enterprisegrade delivery services and runs a simplified service mesh in kubernetes for eastwest traffic strong evolving partner integrations allow organizations to inject enterprisegrade application services into their cicd toolchains which means that developers can focus all their energy on creating applications that delight customers and deliver business value 

we plan to continue building on our existing relationships and to extend our competitive edge by developing new strategic partnerships with other technology leaders and emerging players 

engaging in open source and technology communities 

f5 demonstrated its belief in open source technologies with the acquisition of nginx the popular open source project trusted by more than 400 million websites and developers worldwide this commitment to open source and developer communities will continue as we build on the momentum of 2019 

in fiscal 2019 f5 reached over 25000 technologists at devops community events and saw threefold increases in devops share of voice metrics with the nginx acquisition f5 will continue its devops community engagement investing in thoughtleadership initiatives and hiring technical fellows in the office of the cto 

we will continue to support our network architects as they manage and play a bigger role in leading their company’s digital transformations our online community devcentral lets customers and partners discuss and share the ways in which they use our programmable technologies to solve problems and enhance the security performance and availability of their applications devcentral also provides a valuable window into our customers’ constantly evolving needs that helps guide product development efforts a number of solutions posted by devcentral participants have already become standard features in newer product releases 

f5 products and solutions

nginx 

under the nginx brand we offer 

 we believe the combined forces of f5 and nginx will enable multicloud application services across a broader range of environments than either company could have addressed independently providing the easeofuse and flexibility developers require while also delivering the scale security reliability and enterprise readiness network operations teams demand 

f5 cloud services 

on march 27 2019 we introduced f5 cloud services our saas platform f5 cloud services is a portfolio of enterprisegrade offerings designed to support modern cloud application delivery and security use cases for cloudnative applications microservices and containerbased environments built from the ground up to support devops workflows for modern application teams f5 cloud services can be consumed as a utility through a payasyougo model offering predictable pricing

competition 

as f5 expands its reach and role into a broader set of multicloud application services the companies that we consider as competitors changes too in addition to server load balancing traffic management and other functions normally associated with application delivery our suite of application services has expanded our addressable market into security and policy management where we compete with a number of companies focused on niche areas of application security the ability to create customized programmable services eg using irules enables our customers and our partners to design solutions to problems for which there is no offtheshelf solution as a result we believe the traditional definitions of our market do not encompass all of the features functions and capabilities of our products or accurately represent the addressable market for our solutions 

within the more narrowly defined traditional adc market several companies sell server load balancing products and capabilities these include citrix systems inc radware ltd and a number of other competitors that have a smaller market presence or limited feature set such as a10 networks amazon web services array networks inc barracuda networks inc haproxy kemp technologies microsoft azure and vmware 

in application security we compete with companies that provide web application firewalls bot detection and mitigation carriergrade firewall carriergrade nat ssl orchestration access policy management and ddos protection competitors include a10 akamai cisco citrix imperva juniper radware and symantecblue coat 

the principal competitive factors in the markets in which we compete include form factor consumption model ecosystem integrations features and performance customer support brand recognition scope of distribution and sales channels and pricing some of our competitors have already tried or plan to adopt aggressive pricing policies to gain market share however because f5 offers superior performance broad functionality and lighterweight options with nginx and f5 cloud services coupled with the unique capabilities of our products we believe that we can and will compete effectively against such pricing policies 

corporate functions 

customer services and technical support

we provide these services directly to end users and also utilize a multitiered support model leveraging the capabilities of our channel partners our technical support staff is strategically located in regional service centers to support our global customer base 

product development 

we believe our future success depends on our ability to maintain technology leadership by continuing to improve our products and by developing new products to meet the changing needs of our customers and partners our engineering organization uses standard processes for the development documentation and quality control of services software and systems that are designed to meet these goals these processes include working with our business development and marketing teams customers and partners to identify technology innovation opportunities to better meet the evolving needs of our addressable markets 

over 90 percent of our engineers are engaged in software development in eight major locations the bigip ltm dns and automation tool chain offerings are primarily developed in seattle washington development of security products is centered in tel aviv israel and san jose california with our web application firewall and websafemobilesafe centered in tel aviv and our core firewall afm and identity and access products and technologies developed in san jose policy enforcement manager is also developed in san jose nginx products are developed in san francisco california cork ireland and moscow russia 

our hardware engineering team is located in spokane washington san jose california and tel aviv israel 

smaller development sites including boulder colorado warsaw poland and lowell massachusetts also support the core development teams in the larger centers additionally we have recently opened a dedicated facility to continue to scale and extend engineering across the portfolio in hyderabad india 

members of all our engineering teams collaborate closely with one another to ensure the interoperability and performance of our solutions 

we believe that robust and constant innovation is a necessity for f5 so we are also innovating in new ways for more than a year now we have had dedicated teams focused on testing new disruptive innovations in technology business models or customer segments we expect innovations resulting from the work of these teams will be complementary to our goal of delivering the broadest and most consistent portfolio of application services across cloud and onpremises environments 

during the first quarter of our fiscal 2019 we announced one of the first innovations to come from this program an open beta of our aspen mesh solution with the shift from monolithic to microservice architectures a rapidly increasing number of applications are being deployed in container environments yet there is still a need for services that help enterprises monitor manage and control microservicebased applications at runtime aspen mesh provides critical enterprise features in a platform built on top of istio so organizations can enjoy the benefits of an open source approach without foregoing the features support and guarantees needed to power enterprise applications 

during that same quarter we also introduced the customer early access preview of f5 cloud services a software as a service saas portfolio f5 cloud services provide highavailability selfservice and fully managed saas solutions that are easily provisioned and configured within minutes through an intuitive user interface via declarative apis as enterprisegrade offerings they are designed to support modern deployment scenarios such as cloudnative applications microservices and containerbased environments consumed as a utility through a payasyougo model f5 cloud services offer predictable pricing flexibility and the ability to autoscale to meet application workload demands they also deliver foundational security capabilities and will offer additional protections through future services that allow companies to configure and automate defenses for multiple attack vectors offering f5 capabilities through a saas delivery model provides an extensible framework to deliver additional services as needed over time and throughout an application’s development and production lifecycle 

we rely on a combination of patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights f5 holds 320 patents in the united states and has 43 international patents with applications pending for various aspects of our technology our future success depends in part on our ability to protect our proprietary rights to the technologies used in our principal products despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use trade secrets or other information that we regard as proprietary in addition the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights as fully as the laws of the united states any issued patent may not preserve our proprietary position and competitors or others may develop technologies similar to or superior to our technology our failure to enforce and protect our intellectual property rights could harm our business operating results and financial condition 

in addition to our own proprietary software we incorporate software licensed from several thirdparty sources into our products these are generally term licenses which may renew annually and that generally provide for certain rights and licenses to support our customers post termination while we may not be able to renew all of these licenses in the future we believe that alternative technologies for these licenses are available both domestically and internationally

systems integrators we also market our products through strategic relationships with systems integrators including dell services hp enterprise services and ibm global services who include our products as core components of application deployments or networkbased solutions they deploy for their customers in most cases systems integrators do not directly purchase our products for resale to their customers instead they typically recommend our products as part of broader solutions such as enterprise resource planning erp or customer relationship management crm solutions that incorporate our products for high availability and enhanced performance

 item 1a 

risk factors 

tableend in addition to the other information in this report the following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating our company and operations 

our business could be adversely impacted by conditions affecting the information technology market 

a substantial portion of our business depends on the demand for information technology by large enterprise customers and service providers in addition to the challenges presented by new cloud computing models we are dependent upon the overall economic health of our current and prospective customers and the continued growth and evolution of the internet international national regional and local economic conditions such as recessionary economic cycles protracted economic slowdown or further deterioration of the economy could adversely impact demand for our products demand for our products and services depends substantially upon the general demand for application delivery products and associated services which fluctuates based on numerous factors including capital spending levels and growth of our current and prospective customers as well as general economic conditions moreover the purchase of our products is often discretionary and may involve a significant commitment of capital and other resources future economic projections for the information technology sector are uncertain as companies continue to reassess their spending for technology projects and embrace new models for delivery of it services such as cloud computing and highly orchestrated software defined networking environments as a result spending priorities for our current and future customers may vary and demand for our products and services may be impacted in addition customer buying patterns are changing over time and more customers seek to rent software on a subscription basis and to reduce their total cost of ownership these evolving business models could lead to changes in demand and licensing strategies which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

cloudbased computing trends present competitive and execution risks 

customers are transitioning to a hybrid computing environment utilizing various cloudbased software and services accessed via various smart client devices pricing and delivery models are evolving and our competitors are developing and deploying cloudbased services for customers in addition new cloud infrastructures are enabling the emergence of new competitors including large cloud providers who offer their own adc functionality as well as smaller companies targeting the growing numbers of born in the cloud applications we are devoting significant resources to develop and deploy our own competing cloudbased software and services strategies while we believe our expertise and investments in software and infrastructure for cloudbased services provides us with a strong foundation to compete it is uncertain whether our strategies will attract the customers or generate the revenue required to be successful in addition to software development costs we are incurring costs to build and maintain infrastructure to support cloudcomputing services these costs may reduce the operating margins we have previously achieved whether we are successful in this new business model depends on our execution in a number of areas including 

 these new business models may reduce our revenues or operating margins and could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

industry consolidation may result in increased competition 

some of our competitors have made acquisitions or entered into partnerships or other strategic relationships to offer a more comprehensive solution than they had previously offered we have also entered into large strategic partnerships to enhance our competitive position in the marketplace as it companies attempt to strengthen or maintain their market positions in the evolving application delivery mobility cloud networking and cloud platform markets these companies continue to seek to deliver comprehensive it solutions to end users and combine enterpriselevel hardware and software solutions that may compete with our solutions and which could negatively impact our partnerships these consolidators or potential consolidators may have significantly greater financial technical and other resources than we do and may be better positioned to acquire and offer complementary products and services the companies resulting from these possible combinations may create more compelling product and service offerings and be able to offer greater pricing flexibility or sales and marketing support for such offerings than we can these heightened competitive pressures could result in a loss of customers or a reduction in our revenues or revenue growth rates all of which could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

we may not be able to compete effectively in the emerging application services market 

the markets we serve are new rapidly evolving and highly competitive and we expect competition to persist and intensify in the future our principal competitors in the application services market include citrix systems inc radware ltd and a number of other competitors that have a smaller market presence or limited feature set such as a10 networks amazon web services array networks inc barracuda networks inc haproxy kemp technologies microsoft azure and vmware 

in related markets we compete with companies such as the following 

 we expect to continue to face additional competition as new participants enter our markets as we continue to expand globally we may see new competitors in different geographic regions in addition larger companies with significant resources brand recognition and sales channels may form alliances with or acquire competing application services solutions from other companies and emerge as significant competitors potential competitors may bundle their products or incorporate an internet 

traffic management or security component into existing products in a manner that discourages users from purchasing our products any of these circumstances may limit our opportunities for growth and negatively impact our financial performance 

our success depends on our timely development of new products and features market acceptance of new product offerings and proper management of the timing of the life cycle of our products 

the markets for our products and services are characterized by 

 our continued success depends on our ability to identify and develop new products and new features for our existing products to meet the demands of these changes and the acceptance of those products and features by our existing and target customers in addition our products must interoperate with our end customers’ it infrastructure which often have different specifications deploy products from multiple vendors and utilize multiple protocol standards our customers’ it infrastructure is becoming more complex and we may be reliant on orchestration and interoperability with third party vendors on whom we are reliant for testing and support of new product versions and configurations if we are unable to identify develop and deploy new products and new product features on a timely basis our business and results of operations may be harmed 

the current development cycle for our products is on average 1224 months the introduction of new products or product enhancements may shorten the life cycle of our existing products or replace sales of some of our current products thereby offsetting the benefit of even a successful product introduction and may cause customers to defer purchasing our existing products in anticipation of the new products this could harm our operating results by decreasing sales increasing our inventory levels of older products and exposing us to greater risk of product obsolescence we have also experienced and may in the future experience delays in developing and releasing new products and product enhancements this has led to and may in the future lead to delayed sales increased expenses and lower quarterly revenue than anticipated also in the development of our products we have experienced delays in the prototyping of our products which in turn has led to delays in product introductions in addition complexity and difficulties in managing product transitions at the endoflife stage of a product can create excess inventory of components associated with the outgoing product that can lead to increased expenses any or all of the above problems could materially harm our business and results of operations 

our success depends on sales and continued innovation of our application delivery controller and application security product lines 

we expect to derive a significant portion of our net revenues from sales of our application delivery controller adc and application security products in the future implementation of our strategy depends upon these products being able to solve critical network availability performance and security problems for our customers if our products are unable to solve these problems for our customers or if we are unable to sustain the high levels of innovation in product feature sets needed to maintain leadership in what will continue to be a competitive market environment our business and results of operations will be harmed 

security vulnerabilities in our it systems or products as well as unforeseen product errors could have a material adverse impact on our business results of operations financial condition and reputation 

in the ordinary course of business we store sensitive data including intellectual property personal data our proprietary business information and that of our customers suppliers and business partners on our networks in addition we store sensitive data through cloudbased services that may be hosted by third parties and in data center infrastructure maintained by third parties the secure maintenance of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy our information systems and those of our partners and customers are subject to the increasing threat of intrusions by a wide range of actors including computer programmers hackers or sophisticated nationstate and nationstate supported actors or they may be compromised due to employee error or wrongful conduct malfeasance or other disruptions despite our security measures and those of our thirdparty vendors our information technology and infrastructure has experienced breaches or disruptions and may be vulnerable in the future to breach attacks or disruptions if any breach or attack compromises our networks creates system 

disruptions or slowdowns or exploits security vulnerabilities of our products the information stored on our networks or those of our customers could be accessed and modified publicly disclosed lost or stolen and we may be subject to liability to our customers suppliers business partners and others and suffer reputational and financial harm 

in addition our products are used to manage critical applications and data for customers and third parties may attempt to exploit security vulnerabilities in our products as well as our internal it systems as we continue to focus on the development and marketing of security solutions we become a bigger target for malicious computer hackers including sophisticated nationstate and nationstate supported actors who wish to exploit security vulnerabilities in our products or it systems 

we devote significant resources to addressing security vulnerabilities in our it systems product solutions and services through our efforts to engineer more secure solutions and services enhance security and reliability features in our solutions and services deploy security updates to address security vulnerabilities and seek to respond to known security incidents in sufficient time to minimize any potential adverse impact despite our efforts to harden our infrastructure and build secure solutions from time to time we experience attacks and other cyberthreats these attacks can seek to exploit among other things known or unknown vulnerabilities in technology included in our it infrastructure solutions and services while we have undertaken efforts to mitigate these vulnerabilities they could render our internal systems products and solutions and services susceptible to a cyberattack 

our products may also contain undetected errors or defects when first introduced or as new versions are released we have experienced these errors or defects in the past in connection with new products and product upgrades as our products and customer it infrastructures become increasingly complex customers may experience unforeseen errors in implementing our products into their it environments we expect that these errors or defects will be found from time to time in new or enhanced products after commencement of commercial shipments these problems may cause us to incur significant warranty and repair costs divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts and cause significant customer relations problems we may also be subject to liability claims for damages related to product errors or defects while we carry insurance policies covering this type of liability these policies may not provide sufficient protection should a claim be asserted a material product liability claim may harm our business and results of operations 

our products must successfully operate with products from other vendors as a result when problems occur in a network it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem the occurrence of software or hardware problems whether caused by our products or another vendor’s products may result in the delay or loss of market acceptance of our products the occurrence of any of these problems may harm our business and results of operations 

any errors defects or vulnerabilities in our products or it systems could result in 

 we are dependent on various information technology systems and failures of or interruptions to those systems could harm our business 

many of our business processes depend upon our it systems the systems and processes of third parties and on interfaces with the systems of third parties for example our order entry system provides information to the systems of our contract manufacturers which enables them to build and ship our products if those systems fail or are interrupted or if our ability to 

connect to or interact with one or more networks is interrupted our processes may function at a diminished level or not at all this would harm our ability to ship products and our financial results may be harmed 

in addition reconfiguring our it systems or other business processes in response to changing business needs may be timeconsuming and costly to the extent this impacted our ability to react timely to specific market or business opportunities our financial results may be harmed 

our failure to adequately protect personal information could have a material adverse effect on our business 

a wide variety of local state national and international laws directives and regulations apply to the collection use retention protection disclosure transfer and other processing of personal data these data protection and privacyrelated laws and regulations continue to evolve and may result in everincreasing regulatory and public scrutiny and escalating levels of enforcement and sanctions and increased costs of compliance certain safeharbor exemptions upon which the company relies for data transfers have been challenged and may no longer be available to us in the future our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or to protect such data could result in enforcement action against us including fines imprisonment of company officials and public censure claims for damages by endcustomers and other affected individuals damage to our reputation and loss of goodwill both in relation to existing endcustomers and prospective endcustomers any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations financial performance and business changing definitions of personal data and personal information within the european union the united states and elsewhere especially relating to classification of ip addresses machine identification location data and other information may limit or inhibit our ability to operate or expand our business including limiting strategic partnerships that may involve the sharing of data the evolving data protection regulatory environment may require significant management attention and financial resources to analyze and modify our it infrastructure to meet these changing requirements all of which could reduce our operating margins and impact our operating results and financial condition 

our success depends on our key personnel and our ability to hire retain and motivate qualified executives sales and marketing operations product development and professional services personnel 

our success depends in large part on our ability to attract engage retain and integrate qualified executives and other key employees throughout all areas of our business in order to attract and retain executives and other key employees in a competitive marketplace we must provide a competitive compensation package including cash and equitybased compensation if we do not obtain the stockholder approval needed to continue granting equity compensation in a competitive manner our ability to attract retain and motivate executives and key employees could be weakened failure to successfully hire executives and key employees or the loss of any executives and key employees could have a significant impact on our operations we have recently experienced changes in our senior leadership team including the appointment of mika yamamoto as the companys chief marketing and customer experience officer effective may 6 2019 gus robertson as the general manager of nginx effective may 8 2019 and geng lin as the chief technology officer effective july 1 2019 and we expect to continue to see changes as we build the team that is needed to execute our strategy changes in our management team may be disruptive to our business and any failure to successfully integrate key new hires or promoted employees could adversely affect our business and results of operations the complexity of our products and their integration into existing networks and ongoing support as well as the sophistication of our sales and marketing effort requires us to retain highly trained developers professional services customer support and sales personnel competition for qualified developers professional services customer support and sales personnel in our industry is intense especially in silicon valley and seattle where we have substantial operations and a need for highly skilled personnel because of the limited number of people available with the necessary technical skills and understanding of our products also to the extent we hire personnel from competitors we may be subject to allegations that they have been improperly solicited that they have divulged proprietary or other confidential information that they have violated noncompete obligations to their prior employers or that their former employers own their inventions or other work product our ability to hire and retain these personnel may be adversely affected by volatility or reductions in the price of our common stock or our ability to get approval from shareholders to offer additional common stock to our employees since these employees are generally granted restricted stock units the loss of services of any of our key personnel the inability to retain and attract qualified personnel in the future or delays in hiring qualified personnel may harm our business and results of operations in addition we recently announced a restructuring to realign our workforce to match strategic and financial objectives and optimize resources for long term growth including a reduction in force program impacting a number of employees this restructuring could lead to increased attrition amongst those employees who were not directly affected by the reduction in force program 

we recently implemented a restructuring program which we cannot guarantee will achieve its intended result 

in july 2018 we announced a restructuring program to match strategic and financial objectives and optimize resources for long term growth we incur substantial costs to implement restructuring plans and our restructuring activities may subject us to 

litigation risks and expenses our past restructuring plans do not provide any assurance that additional restructuring plans will not be required or implemented in the future in addition our restructuring plans may have other consequences such as attrition beyond our planned reduction in workforce a negative effect on employee morale and productivity or our ability to attract highly skilled employees our competitors may also use our restructuring plans to seek to gain a competitive advantage over us as a result our restructuring plans may affect our revenue and other operating results in the future 

the average selling price of our products may decrease and our costs may increase which may negatively impact revenues and profits 

it is possible that the average selling prices of our products will decrease in the future in response to competitive pricing pressures increased sales discounts new product introductions by us or our competitors as well as the shift to more software consumption based and “as a service based” models or other factors therefore in order to maintain our profits we must develop and introduce new products and product enhancements on a timely basis and continually reduce our product costs our failure to do so could cause our revenue and profits to decline which would harm our business and results of operations in addition we may experience substantial periodtoperiod fluctuations in future operating results due to the erosion of our average selling prices 

our business may be harmed if our contract manufacturers are not able to provide us with adequate supplies of our products or if a single source of hardware assembly is lost or impaired 

we outsource the manufacturing of our hardware platforms to third party contract manufacturers who assemble these hardware platforms to our specifications we have experienced minor delays in shipments from contract manufacturers in the past however if we experience major delays in the future or other problems such as inferior quality and insufficient quantity of product any one or a combination of these factors may harm our business and results of operations the inability of our contract manufacturers to provide us with adequate supplies of our products or the loss of one or more of our contract manufacturers may cause a delay in our ability to fulfill orders while we obtain a replacement manufacturer and may harm our business and results of operations in particular we currently subcontract manufacturing of our products to a single contract manufacturer with whom we do not have a longterm contract if our arrangement with this single source of hardware assembly was terminated or otherwise impaired and we were not able to engage another contract manufacturer in a timely manner our business financial condition and results of operation could be adversely affected 

if the demand for our products grows we will need to increase our raw material and component purchases contract manufacturing capacity and internal test and quality control functions any disruptions in product flow may limit our revenue may harm our competitive position and may result in additional costs or cancellation of orders by our customers 

our business could suffer if there are any interruptions or delays in the supply of hardware components from our thirdparty sources 

we currently purchase several hardware components used in the assembly of our products from a number of single or limited sources lead times for these components vary significantly the unavailability of suitable components any interruption or delay in the supply of any of these hardware components or the inability to procure a similar component from alternate sources at acceptable prices within a reasonable time may delay assembly and sales of our products and hence our revenues and may harm our business and results of operations 

it is difficult to predict our future operating results because we have an unpredictable sales cycle 

our products have a lengthy sales cycle and the timing of our revenue is difficult to predict historically our sales cycle has ranged from approximately two to three months and has tended to lengthen as our products become increasingly complex also as our distribution strategy is focused on a channel model utilizing valueadded resellers distributors and systems integrators the level of variability in the length of sales cycle across transactions has increased and made it more difficult to predict the timing of many of our sales transactions sales of our products require us to educate potential customers in their use and benefits sales of our products are subject to delays from the lengthy internal budgeting approval and competitive evaluation processes that large enterprises and governmental entities may require for example customers frequently begin by evaluating our products on a limited basis and devote time and resources to testing our products before they decide whether or not to purchase customers may also defer orders as a result of anticipated releases of new products or enhancements by our competitors or us as a result our products have an unpredictable sales cycle that contributes to the uncertainty of our future operating results 

we may not be able to sustain or develop new distribution relationships and a reduction or delay in sales to significant distribution partners could hurt our business 

we sell our products and services through multiple distribution channels in the united states and internationally including leading industry distributors valueadded resellers systems integrators service providers and other indirect channel partners we have a limited number of agreements with companies in these channels and we may not be able to increase our number of distribution relationships or maintain our existing relationships recruiting and retaining qualified channel partners and training them in our technologies requires significant time and resources these channel partners may also market sell and support products and services that are competitive with ours and may devote more resources to the marketing sales and support of such competitive products our indirect sales channel structure could subject us to lawsuits potential liability and reputational harm if for example any of our channel partners misrepresent the functionality of our products or services to customers or violate laws or our corporate policies if we are unable to establish or maintain our indirect sales channels our business and results of operations will be harmed in addition three worldwide distributors of our products accounted for 384 of our total net revenue for fiscal year 2019  a substantial reduction or delay in sales of our products to these distribution partners if not replaced by sales to other indirect channel partners and distributors could harm our business operating results and financial condition 

a portion of our revenue is generated by sales to government entities which are subject to a number of challenges and risks 

sales to us and foreign federal state and local governmental agency endcustomers account for a significant portion of our revenues and we may in the future increase sales to government entities sales to government entities are subject to a number of risks selling to government entities can be highly competitive expensive and time consuming often requiring significant upfront time and expense without any assurance that these efforts will generate a sale the substantial majority of our sales to date to government entities have been made indirectly through our channel partners government certification requirements for products like ours may change thereby restricting our ability to sell into the federal government sector until we have attained the revised certification government demand and payment for our products and services may be impacted by public sector budgetary cycles and funding authorizations with funding reductions or delays adversely affecting public sector demand for our products and services government entities may have statutory contractual or other legal rights to terminate contracts with our distributors and resellers for convenience or due to a default and any such termination may adversely impact our future operating results governments routinely investigate and audit government contractors’ administrative processes and any unfavorable audit could result in the government refusing to continue buying our products and services a reduction of revenue or fines or civil or criminal liability if the audit uncovers improper or illegal activities which could adversely impact our operating results in a material way finally for purchases by the us government the government may require certain products to be manufactured in the united states and other relatively high cost manufacturing locations and we may not manufacture all products in locations that meet the requirements of the us government affecting our ability to sell these products to the us government 

misuse of our products could harm our reputation 

our products may be misused by endcustomers or third parties that obtain access to our products for example our products could be used to censor private access to certain information on the internet such use of our products for censorship could result in negative publicity and damage to our reputation in addition as many of our products are subject to export control regulations diversion of our products to restricted third parties by others could result in investigations penalties fines trade restrictions and negative publicity that could damage our reputation and materially impact our business operating results and financial condition 

our quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate in future periods which may cause our stock price to fluctuate 

our quarterly and annual operating results have varied significantly in the past and could vary significantly in the future which makes it difficult for us to predict our future operating results our operating results may fluctuate due to a variety of factors many of which are outside of our control including the changing and recently volatile us and global economic environment which may cause our stock price to fluctuate in particular we anticipate that the size of customer orders may increase as we continue to focus on larger business accounts a delay in the recognition of revenue even from just one account may have a significant negative impact on our results of operations for a given period in the past a majority of our sales have been realized near the end of a quarter accordingly a delay in an anticipated sale past the end of a particular quarter may negatively impact our results of operations for that quarter or in some cases that fiscal year additionally we have exposure to the credit risks of some of our customers and subtenants although we have programs in place that are designed to monitor and mitigate the associated risk there can be no assurance that such programs will be effective in reducing our credit risks adequately we monitor individual payment capability in granting credit arrangements seek to limit the total credit to amounts 

we believe our customers can pay and maintain reserves we believe are adequate to cover exposure for potential losses if there is a deterioration of a subtenant’s or a major customer’s creditworthiness or actual defaults are higher than expected future losses if incurred could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our operating results further our operating results may be below the expectations of securities analysts and investors in future quarters or years our failure to meet these expectations will likely harm the market price of our common stock such a decline could occur and has occurred in the past even when we have met our publicly stated revenue andor earnings guidance 

reliance on shipments at the end of the quarter could cause our revenue for the applicable period to fall below expected levels 

as a result of customer buying patterns and the efforts of our sales force and channel partners to meet or exceed their sales objectives we have historically received a substantial portion of sales orders and generated a substantial portion of revenue during the last few weeks of each fiscal quarter in addition any significant interruption in our information technology systems which manage critical functions such as order processing revenue recognition financial forecasts inventory and supply chain management and trade compliance reviews could result in delayed order fulfillment and decreased revenue for that fiscal quarter if expected revenue at the end of any fiscal quarter is delayed for any reason including the failure of anticipated purchase orders to materialize our third party contract manufacturers’ inability to manufacture and ship products prior to fiscal quarterend to fulfill purchase orders received near the end of the fiscal quarter our failure to manage inventory to meet demand our inability to release new products on schedule any failure of our systems related to order review and processing or any delays in shipments based on trade compliance requirements our revenue for that quarter could fall below our expectations resulting in a decline in the trading price of our common stock 

changes in financial accounting standards may cause adverse unexpected revenue fluctuations and affect our reported results of operations 

a change in accounting policies can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective new pronouncements and varying interpretations of existing pronouncements have occurred with frequency and may occur in the future changes to existing rules or changes to the interpretations of existing rules could lead to changes in our accounting practices and such changes could adversely affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business 

if we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting the accuracy and timeliness of our financial reporting may be adversely affected 

as a public company we are required to design and maintain proper and effective internal controls over financial reporting and to report any material weaknesses in such internal controls section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 requires that we evaluate and determine the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting and provide a management report on the internal controls over financial reporting which must be attested to by our independent registered public accounting firm we have an ongoing program to review the design of our internal controls framework in keeping with changes in business needs implement necessary changes to our controls design and test the system and process controls necessary to comply with these requirements if in the future our internal controls over financial reporting are determined to be not effective resulting in a material weakness investor perceptions regarding the reliability of our financial statements may be adversely affected which could cause a decline in the market price of our stock and otherwise negatively affect our liquidity and financial condition 

we may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities 

our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be affected by changes in our business operations including acquisitions new offerings and changes in the jurisdictions in which we operate the provision for income taxes may also be impacted by changes in stockbased compensation changes in the research and development tax credit laws earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and being higher than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates transfer pricing adjustments not meeting the terms and conditions of tax holidays or incentives changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in actual results versus our estimates or changes in tax laws regulations accounting principles or interpretations thereof including changes to the tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals our results of operations and cash flows could be affected by future guidance implementing the provisions of the tax cuts and jobs act in addition we may be subject to examination of our income tax returns by the us internal revenue service and other tax authorities while we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes from such examinations and the adequacy of our provision for income taxes there can be no assurance that such provision is sufficient and that a determination by a tax authority will not have an adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows 

we are subject to governmental export and import controls that could subject us to liability or impair our ability to compete in international markets 

our products are subject to us export controls and may be exported outside the us only with the required level of export license or through an export license exception because we incorporate encryption technology into our products in addition various countries regulate the import of certain encryption technology and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute our products or our customers’ ability to implement our products in those countries changes in our products or changes in export and import regulations may create delays in the introduction of our products in international markets prevent our customers with international operations from deploying our products throughout their global systems or in some cases prevent the export or import of our products to certain countries altogether any change in export or import regulations or related legislation shift in approach to the enforcement or scope of existing regulations or change in the countries persons or technologies targeted by such regulations could result in decreased use of our products by or in our decreased ability to export or sell our products to existing or potential customers with international operations any decreased use of our products or limitation on our ability to export or sell our products would likely adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property and our products may infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties 

we rely on a combination of patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure of confidential and proprietary information to protect our intellectual property rights despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology monitoring unauthorized use of our products is difficult and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of our technology particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 

our industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the ordinary course of our business we are involved in disputes and licensing discussions with others regarding their claimed proprietary rights and cannot provide assurance that we will always successfully defend ourselves against such claims and such matters are subject to many uncertainties and outcomes are not predictable with assurance we expect that infringement claims may increase as the number of products and competitors in our market increases and overlaps occur also as we have gained greater visibility market exposure and competitive success we face a higher risk of being the subject of intellectual property infringement claims if we are found to infringe the proprietary rights of others or if we otherwise settle such claims we could be compelled to pay damages or royalties and either obtain a license to those intellectual property rights or alter our products so that they no longer infringe upon such proprietary rights any license could be very expensive to obtain or may not be available at all or may require us to make royalty payments which could adversely affect gross margins in future periods the actual liability in any such matters may be materially different from our estimate if any which could result in the need to adjust the liability and record additional expenses similarly changing our products or processes to avoid infringing upon the rights of others may be costly or impractical in addition we have initiated and may in the future initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to determine the scope and validity of our proprietary rights or those of our competitors any of these claims whether claims that we are infringing the proprietary rights of others or vice versa with or without merit may be timeconsuming result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel or require us to cease using infringing technology develop noninfringing technology or enter into royalty or licensing agreements further our license agreements typically require us to indemnify our customers distributors and resellers for infringement actions related to our technology which could cause us to become involved in infringement claims made against our customers distributors or resellers any of the abovedescribed circumstances relating to intellectual property rights disputes could result in our business and results of operations being harmed 

we incorporate open source software into our products although we monitor our use of open source closely the terms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by us courts and there is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products we could also be subject to similar conditions or restrictions should there be any changes in the licensing terms of the open source software incorporated into our products in either event we could be required to seek licenses from third parties in order to continue offering our products to reengineer our products or to discontinue the sale of our products in the event reengineering cannot be accomplished on a timely or successful basis any of which could adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

many of our products include intellectual property licensed from third parties in the future it may be necessary to renew licenses for third party intellectual property or obtain new licenses for other technology these third party licenses may not be 

available to us on acceptable terms if at all the inability to obtain certain licenses or litigation regarding the interpretation or enforcement of license rights and related intellectual property issues could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition furthermore we license some third party intellectual property on a nonexclusive basis and this may limit our ability to protect our intellectual property rights in our products 

our operating results are exposed to risks associated with international commerce 

as our international sales increase our operating results become more exposed to international operating risks additionally our international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks including the following 

 in addition in june 2016 voters in the united kingdom approved an advisory referendum to withdraw from the european union commonly referred to as brexit the uncertainty surrounding the terms of the united kingdoms withdrawal and its consequences may cause our customers to closely monitor their costs and reduce their spending on our products and services 

we must hire and train experienced personnel to staff and manage our foreign operations to the extent that we experience difficulties in recruiting training managing and retaining an international staff and specifically staff related to sales management and sales personnel we may experience difficulties in sales productivity in foreign markets we also enter into strategic distributor and reseller relationships with companies in certain international markets where we do not have a local presence if we are not able to maintain successful strategic distributor relationships internationally or recruit additional companies to enter into strategic distributor relationships our future success in these international markets could be limited business practices in the international markets that we serve may differ from those in the united states and may require us in the future to include terms other than our standard terms in customer contracts we intend to continue expanding into international markets sales outside of the americas represented 445 and 443 of our net revenues for the fiscal years ended september 30 2019 and 2018  respectively 

these factors and other factors could harm our ability to gain future international revenues and consequently materially impact our business operating results and financial condition the expansion of our existing international operations and entry into additional international markets will require significant management attention and financial resources our failure to successfully manage our international operations and the associated risks effectively could limit the future growth of our business 

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates which could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our sales contracts are denominated in us dollars and therefore substantially all of our revenue is not subject to foreign currency risk however a strengthening of the us dollar could increase the real cost of our solutions to our end customers outside of the united states which could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results in addition an 

increasing portion of our operating expenses is incurred outside the united states is denominated in foreign currencies and is subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates if we become more exposed to currency fluctuations and are not able to successfully hedge against the risks associated with currency fluctuations our operating results could be adversely affected to date we have not entered into any hedging arrangements with respect to foreign currency risk or other derivative instruments 

changes in governmental regulations could negatively affect our revenues 

many of our products are subject to various regulations promulgated by the united states and various foreign governments including but not limited to environmental regulations and regulations implementing export license requirements and restrictions on the import or export of some technologies especially encryption technology changes in governmental regulation and our inability or failure to obtain required approvals permits or registrations could harm our international and domestic sales and adversely affect our revenues business and operations 

new regulations related to conflict minerals may force us to incur additional expenses and could limit the supply and increase the costs of certain metals and minerals used in the manufacturing of our products 

in august 2012 the sec adopted new requirements under the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 or the doddfrank act for companies that use certain minerals and derivative metals referred to as conflict minerals regardless of their country of origin in their products whether or not these products are manufactured by third parties the doddfrank act requires companies to perform due diligence and disclose whether or not such minerals originate from the democratic republic of congo or adjoining countries we filed a report on form sd with the sec regarding such matters on may 31 2019 these requirements could adversely affect the sourcing availability and pricing of minerals or metals used in the manufacture of our products and the numerous components that go into our products all of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results in addition we will incur additional costs to comply with the disclosure requirements including costs related to determining the source of any relevant minerals and metals used in our products we have a complex supply chain and many components are sourced through our contract manufacturer and we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins for these minerals and metals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement as a result we may face reputational challenges with our customers and other stakeholders and possible regulatory risk 

we face litigation risks 

we are a party to lawsuits in the normal course of our business litigation in general and intellectual property and securities litigation in particular can be expensive lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations moreover the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict responding to lawsuits has been and will likely continue to be expensive and timeconsuming for us an unfavorable resolution of these lawsuits could adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

acquisitions present many risks and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that are contemplated at the time of the transaction 

with respect to our past acquisitions as well as any other future acquisitions we may undertake we may find that the acquired businesses products or technologies do not further our business strategy as expected that we paid more than what the assets are later worth or that economic conditions change all of which may generate future impairment charges our acquisitions may be viewed negatively by customers financial markets or investors there may be difficulty integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired business and we may have difficulty retaining the key personnel of the acquired business we may have difficulty in integrating the acquired technologies or products with our existing product lines our ongoing business and management’s attention may be disrupted or diverted by transition or integration issues and the complexity of managing geographically and culturally diverse locations we may have difficulty maintaining uniform standards controls procedures and policies across locations we may experience significant problems or liabilities associated with product quality technology and other matters 

our inability to successfully operate and integrate newlyacquired businesses appropriately effectively and in a timely manner or to retain key personnel of any acquired business could have a material adverse effect on our ability to take advantage of further growth in demand for integrated traffic management and security solutions and other advances in technology as well as on our revenues gross margins and expenses 

antitakeover provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us 

our board of directors has the authority to issue up to 10000000 shares of preferred stock and to determine the price rights preferences privileges and restrictions including voting rights of those shares without any further vote or action by the shareholders the rights of the holders of common stock may be subject to and may be adversely affected by the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future the issuance of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a change of control of our company without further action by our shareholders and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of the holders of common stock further certain provisions of our bylaws including a provision limiting the ability of shareholders to raise matters at a meeting of shareholders without giving advance notice may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or management of our company which could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock similarly state antitakeover laws in the state of washington related to corporate takeovers may prevent or delay a change of control of our company 

our stock price could be volatile particularly during times of economic uncertainty and volatility in domestic and international stock markets 

our stock price has been volatile and has fluctuated significantly in the past the trading price of our stock is likely to continue to be volatile and subject to fluctuations in the future some of the factors that could significantly affect the market price of our stock include 

 the stock market in general and the market for technology companies in particular have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations these fluctuations have often been unrelated or disproportionate to operating performance the fluctuations may continue in the future and this could significantly impact the value of our stock and your investment 

if securities or industry analysts publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business or discontinue publishing research about our business the price and trading volume of our securities could decline 

the trading market for our common stock is influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us our business our market or our competitors if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our common stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business the price of our securities would likely decline if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly demand for our securities could decrease which might cause the price and trading volume of our securities to decline 

we face risks associated with having operations and employees located in israel 

we have offices and employees located in israel as a result political economic and military conditions in israel directly affect our operations the future of peace efforts between israel and its arab neighbors remains uncertain there has been a significant increase in hostilities and political unrest in israel in the past year the effects of these hostilities and violence on the israeli economy and our operations in israel are unclear and we cannot predict the effect on us of further increases in these hostilities or future armed conflict political instability or violence in the region in addition many of our employees in israel are obligated to perform annual reserve duty in the israeli military and are subject to being called for active duty under emergency circumstances we cannot predict the full impact of these conditions on us in the future particularly if emergency circumstances or an escalation in the political situation occurs if many of our employees in israel are called for active duty for a significant period of time our operations and our business could be disrupted and may not be able to function at full capacity current or future tensions and conflicts in the middle east could adversely affect our business operating results financial condition and cash flows 

our business is subject to the risks of earthquakes fire power outages floods and other catastrophic events and to interruption by manmade problems such as terrorism 

a significant natural disaster such as an earthquake a fire a flood or a significant power outage could have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition we have an administrative and product development office and a third party contract manufacturer located in the san francisco bay area a region known for seismic activity in addition natural disasters could affect our supply chain manufacturing vendors or logistics providers’ ability to provide 

materials and perform services such as manufacturing products or assisting with shipments on a timely basis in the event our or our service providers’ information technology systems or manufacturing or logistics abilities are hindered by any of the events discussed above shipments could be delayed resulting in missed financial targets such as revenue and shipment targets for a particular quarter in addition cyberattacks acts of terrorism or other geopolitical unrest could cause disruptions in our business or the business of our supply chain manufacturers logistics providers partners or endcustomers or the economy as a whole any disruption in the business of our supply chain manufacturers logistics providers partners or endcustomers that impacts sales at the end of a fiscal quarter could have a significant adverse impact on our quarterly results all of the aforementioned risks may be further increased if the disaster recovery plans for us and our suppliers prove to be inadequate to the extent that any of the above should result in delays or cancellations of customer orders or the delay in the manufacture deployment or shipment of our products our business financial condition and operating results would be adversely affected 

in addition to other risks listed in this “risk factors” section factors that may affect our operating results include but are not limited to

our management team monitors and analyzes a number of key performance indicators in order to manage our business and evaluate our financial and operating performance on a consolidated basis those indicators include 



facilities to support our operations worldwide as well as investments in information technology infrastructure and equipment purchases to support our core business activities we will continue to evaluate possible acquisitions of or investments in businesses products or technologies that we believe are strategic which may require the use of cash or other financing arrangements 



critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we believe that of our significant accounting policies which are described in note 1 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity accordingly these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 

revenue recognition on october 1 2018 we adopted the new revenue recognition standard by applying the modified retrospective approach to those contracts which were not completed as of october 1 2018 results for reporting periods beginning after october 1 2018 are presented under the new revenue recognition standard while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for the prior periods 

we sell products through distributors resellers and directly to end users revenue related to our contracts with customers is recognized by following a fivestep process 

 the following is a description of the principal activities from which we generate revenue 

product 

revenue from the sale of our hardware and perpetual software products is generally recognized at a point in time when the product has been fulfilled and the customer is obligated to pay for the product when rights of return are present and we cannot estimate returns revenue is recognized when such rights of return lapse payment terms to domestic customers are generally net 30 days to net 45 days payment terms to international customers range from net 30 days to net 120 days based on normal and customary trade practices in the individual markets

we also offer several products by subscription either through termbased license agreements or as a service through our cloudbased silverline platform revenue for termbased license agreements is recognized at a point in time when we deliver the software license to the customer and the subscription term has commenced for our softwareasaservice silverline offerings revenue is recognized ratably as the services are provided 

support and professional services 

revenues for postcontract customer support pcs are recognized on a straightline basis over the service contract term pcs includes a limited period of telephone support updates repair or replacement of any failed product or component that fails during the term of the agreement bug fixes and rights to upgrades when and if available consulting services are customarily billed at fixed hourly rates plus outofpocket expenses and revenues are recognized as the consulting is completed similarly training revenue is recognized as the training is completed 

contract acquisition costs 

sales commissions earned by our sales force are considered incremental and recoverable costs of obtaining a contract with a customer sales commissions for initial service contracts and subscription offerings are deferred and then amortized as an expense on a straightline basis over the period of benefit which management has determined to be 45 years and 3 years  respectively 

significant judgments 

we enter into certain contracts with customers including enterprise license arrangements with nonstandard terms and conditions management exercises significant judgment in assessing contractual terms in these arrangements to identify and evaluate performance obligations and total consideration management allocates consideration to each performance obligation based on relative fair value using standalone selling price and recognizes associated revenue as control is transferred to the customer 

business combinations our business combinations are accounted for under the acquisition method we allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values the excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets 

on may 8 2019 we completed our acquisition of nginx inc for a total purchase price of 6432 million  of which approximately 625 million of finitelived developed technology was recorded management valued the developed technology using the relieffromroyalty method under the income approach this method reflects the present value of the projected cash flows that are expected to be generated from the licensing of the asset to thirdparties management applied significant judgment in estimating the fair value of the acquired developed technology which involved the use of a significant assumption with respect to the royalty rate

increase of 85 million in interest income compared to the prior year partially offset by foreign currency losses of 75 million  compared to the prior year 

provision for income taxes we recorded a 210 provision for income taxes for fiscal year 2019  compared to 249 in fiscal year 2018 and 269 in fiscal year 2017  the decrease in the effective tax rate from fiscal year 2018 to 2019 is primarily due to a further reduction in the us federal income tax rate to 21 the nonrecurring tax expense recorded in fiscal year 2018 for deemed repatriation of undistributed foreign earnings and remeasurement of net deferred tax assets partially offset by a decrease in tax deductible stock compensation the decrease in the effective tax rate from fiscal year 2017 to 2018 was primarily due to the impacts of the tax cuts and jobs act enacted on december 22 2017 partially offset with foreign tax credits from a onetime distribution in fiscal year 2017 

we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount we believe is morelikelythannot to be realized in making these determinations we consider historical and projected taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the appropriateness of a valuation allowance the net increase in the valuation allowance of 07 million for fiscal year 2019 and 46 million for fiscal year 2018 was primarily related to tax net operating losses incurred in certain foreign jurisdictions and state tax credit carryforwards our net deferred tax assets as of september 30 2019  2018 and 2017 were 274 million  334 million and 532 million  respectively 

our worldwide effective tax rate may fluctuate based on a number of factors including variations in projected taxable income in the various geographic locations in which we operate changes in the valuation of our net deferred tax assets resolution of potential exposures tax positions taken on tax returns filed in the various geographic locations in which we operate and the introduction of new accounting standards or changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof in the various geographic locations in which we operate we have recorded liabilities to address potential tax exposures related to business and income tax positions we have taken that could be challenged by taxing authorities the ultimate resolution of these potential exposures may be greater or less than the liabilities recorded which could result in an adjustment to our future tax expense 

liquidity and capital resources 

we have funded our operations with our cash balances cash generated from operations and proceeds from public offerings of our securities 

  



cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and longterm investments totaled 13307 million as of september 30 2019  compared to 14506 million as of september 30 2018  representing a decrease of 1199 million  the decrease was primarily due to 6116 million in cash paid for the acquisition of nginx in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 as well as 2010 million of cash required for the repurchase of outstanding common stock under our share repurchase program in fiscal year 2019 and 1035 million of capital expenditures related to the expansion of our facilities to support our operations worldwide the decrease was partially offset by cash provided by operating activities of 7478 million  as of september 30 2019  558 of our cash and cash equivalents and investment balances were outside of the us the cash and cash equivalents and investment balances outside of the us are subject to fluctuation based on the settlement of intercompany balances in fiscal year 2018  the increase to cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and longterm investments from the prior year was primarily due to cash provided by operating activities of 7611 million  partially offset by 6001 million of cash required for the repurchase of outstanding common stock under our share repurchase program and 535 million of capital expenditures related to the expansion of our facilities to support our operations worldwide as of september 30 2018  376 of our cash and cash equivalents and investment balances were outside of the us 

cash provided by operating activities during fiscal year 2019 was 7478 million compared to 7611 million in fiscal year 2018 and 7403 million in fiscal year 2017  cash provided by operating activities resulted primarily from cash generated from net income after adjusting for noncash charges such as stockbased compensation depreciation and amortization charges and changes in operating assets and liabilities 

cash used in investing activities during fiscal year 2019 was 4146 million compared to cash used in investing activities of 4560 million in fiscal year 2018 and cash used in investing activities of 322 million in fiscal year 2017  cash used in investing activities for fiscal year 2019 was primarily the result of 6116 million in cash paid for the acquisition of nginx along with capital expenditures related to the buildout of our new corporate headquarters and the purchase of investments partially offset by the maturity and sale of investments cash used in investing activities for fiscal years 2018 and 2017 was primarily the result of the purchase of investments and capital expenditures related to maintaining our operations worldwide partially offset by the sale and maturity of investments

based on our current operating and capital expenditure forecasts we believe that our existing cash and investment balances together with cash generated from operations should be sufficient to meet our operating requirements for the next twelve months our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our rate of revenue growth the expansion of our sales and marketing activities the timing and extent of expansion into new territories the timing of introductions of new products and enhancements of existing products the continuing market acceptance of our products and cash paid for future acquisitions

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

tableend interest rate risk our cash equivalents consist of highquality securities as specified in our investment policy guidelines the policy limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue or issuer to a maximum of 5 of the total portfolio with the exception of us treasury and agency securities and money market funds which are exempt from size limitation the policy requires investments in securities that mature in three years or less with the average maturity being no greater than one and a half years these securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if interest rates increase a decrease of one percent in the average interest rate would have resulted in a decrease of approximately 122 million in our interest income for the fiscal year 2019  

  



foreign currency risk the majority of our sales and expenses are denominated in us dollars and as a result we have not experienced significant foreign currency transaction gains and losses to date while we have conducted some transactions in foreign currencies during the fiscal year ended 2019 and expect to continue to do so we do not anticipate that foreign currency transaction gains or losses will be significant at our current level of operations however as we continue to expand our operations internationally transaction gains or losses may become significant in the future we have not engaged in foreign currency hedging to date however we may do so in the future

industry context 

growth and evolution of applications 

today as more and more businesses go digital increasingly the value of the modern enterprise resides in its applications and its data in all applications make up the digital dna of an enterprise enabling new customer experiences increased revenue opportunities and scaled operations in fact research shows that there are over 250 million enterprise application workloads alive in the world today growing to approximately 17 billion over the next few years applications have become a primary vehicle through which businesses develop and deliver their goods and services whether physical or digital in nature 

emergence of the dynamic data center and multicloud infrastructures 

from a broad perspective the goal of it organizations is to optimize the secure delivery of applications to users wherever they are and whenever they need them regardless of where those applications exist f5 helps organizations accomplish this goal with softwarebased application services that support varied and evolving deployment models 

dynamic data center  server virtualization has enabled organizations to group or partition data center compute resources to meet user demand dynamically and reconfigure these virtual resources easily and quickly as demand changes more recently softwaredefined networking sdn offers organizations a means to reduce costs increase flexibility and simplify deployment and management of it infrastructure through network virtualization f5 products play key roles in application delivery and security in both environments 

multicloud environments  many organizations are taking advantage of the growing availability of private and public cloud resources as a flexible secure and reliable alternative to owning and managing static infrastructure components directly f5 state of application delivery soad and other studies show that customers are increasingly moving towards multicloud architectures where applications onpremises must coexist and collaborate with applications in the cloud and across multiple clouds f5 solutions can simplify the deployment delivery security and management of applications in such environments 

these changes in the data center and multicloud environments have created new challenges for the security of networks data and applications with increasing frequency sophisticated attackers have sought to compromise applications particularly in highly distributed environments moreover advanced denialofservice attacks have exposed major vulnerabilities in the security perimeter of corporate networks by overwhelming devices and effectively shutting down the networks in addition many networklevel security threats are directly related to the improper use of the same protocols that applications depend on to transmit data intrusion detection and prevention devices which rely on signature databases of known threats afford some protection against these types of attacks however they offer limited protection against many of the most common threats including information leakage content spoofing crosssite request forgery or “zeroday” attacks designed to exploit a variety of application vulnerabilities 

in addition to preventing the threat of attacks designed to disrupt destroy or block access to network applications organizations are faced with the equally daunting challenge of controlling access to applications and data the proliferation of mobile devices has given users with smart phones tablets and laptops the ability to access corporate materials from virtually anywhere via private and public cloud resources as well as traditional data centers this in turn has increased the difficulty of ensuring that mobile users are only able to access applications and data for which they are authorized and that applications and data are protected from access by unauthorized users 

application services 

application services are network and security services  sometimes referred to as layer 47 services or even application delivery services there is a large and growing variety of these services available today covering availability performance security identity and access management to name a few 

in our view application services emerged from the disaggregation of capabilities that formerly were integrated into devices such as application delivery controllers adcs but are now softwaredefined loosely coupled and easily consumed in essence making it easier to attach an individual service to an application based on a specific need at a specific point in time 

the benefit of robust application services is that they enable it to enforce consistent service quality across the entire application portfolio this “consistent service quality” means that there is an additional layer of security availability and reliability that is enforced independently of whether the applications have such capabilities builtin or not it is critical in a time where much of the user experience is digital in nature delivered via the cloud and increasingly built by teams of developers outside of the it organization 

when made a core part of an enterprisewide infrastructure an application services provider like f5 can provide a level of assurance to the business that its application portfolio remains available reliable and secure 

the need to optimize the secure delivery of applications and data 

with the ongoing evolution and increasing complexity of it infrastructures there is a growing need to optimize the secure delivery of applications and data over ip networks ipbased traffic passing between enduser devices servers and cloud resources is divided into discrete packets that travel by multiple routes to their destination where they are reassembled the basic disassembly routing and reassembly of transmissions are relatively straightforward and require limited intelligence by contrast managing inspecting modifying redirecting and securing application traffic going to and from servers can require highly intelligent systems capable of performing an expanding array of functions broadly speaking all of those functions are aspects of application delivery 

application delivery services dynamically manage secure and optimize the flow of traffic between users and servers physical or virtual and cloud environments freeing up other resources by offloading common network functions such as encryption ipv4ipv6 translation compression authentication rateshaping and a variety of specialized functions including network and application security services policy management and wan optimization that would otherwise have to be coded into applications since most large enterprises have hundreds — if not thousands — of applications it isnt practical to replicate these functions within each instance of an application and maintain consistent policies across a broad spectrum of different applications in traditional data centers it has been common practice to deploy an array of point products in front of server farms to provide various services but that typically requires integrating maintaining and upgrading disparate technologies from different vendors a process that is timeconsuming and expensive in terms of both capital and operating costs from a security standpoint it is also much more difficult to audit traffic passing through multiple devices in such environments a more practical and efficient solution is a comprehensive set of integrated application delivery services on a single highperformance device in virtual and cloud environments where flexibility is a priority software designed to run on standard hypervisors provides the same services and many of the benefits associated with hardwarebased solutions 

although application delivery services are broadly applicable within enterprise and service provider it infrastructures service providers face unique challenges as they attempt to modernize and scale their networks to deal with the flood of data generated by smart phones tablets wearables and other mobile devices to cope with these challenges many service providers have been migrating legacy 2g3g infrastructures to 4g5glte networks and evolved packet core epc data centers that require an array of network and application services today most of those services are deployed on separate appliances from different vendors and service providers are actively seeking solutions that will enable them to lower costs and improve reliability and performance by consolidating services and reducing the number of devices increasingly they are also demanding software solutions designed to run on commodity hardware that can be repurposed as needed to cope with the dramatic increase in signaling traffic associated with 4g5glte networks the challenges of migrating legacy infrastructure and the need to integrate charging and enforcement functions with subscriber data service providers have also adopted the diameter signaling protocol as the de facto standard for communication within their evolving data centers

sales and marketing 

sales 

we sell our products and services to large enterprise customers and service providers through a variety of channels including distributors valueadded resellers vars managed service providers msps and systems integrators a substantial amount of our revenue for fiscal year 2018  was derived from these channel sales our sales teams work closely with our channel partners and also sell our products and services directly to major accounts 

f5 sales teams our inside sales team generates and qualifies leads for regional sales managers and helps manage accounts by serving as a liaison between the field and internal corporate resources our field sales personnel are located in major cities in four sales regions the americas primarily the united states europe the middle east and africa emea japan and the asia pacific region apac field sales personnel work closely with our channel partners to assist them as necessary in the sale of our products and services to their customers we reward our partners that identify new business and provide sales expertise for our portfolio of products and solutions through various incentive programs we also sell our products and services directly to customers primarily large enterprises whose accounts are managed by our major account team systems engineers with deep technical domain expertise support our regional sales account managers and channel partners by participating in joint sales calls and providing presale technical solution engineering and support resources as needed 

distributors vars and msps as a key component of our sales strategy we have established relationships with a number of large national and international distributors local and specialized distributors vars and msps we derive a 

majority of our product sales from vars and msps rely on our large distributors for fulfillment training and partner enablement 

our agreements with these channel partners are not exclusive and do not prevent them from selling competitive products these agreements typically have terms of one year with no obligation to renew and typically do not provide for exclusive sales territories or minimum purchase requirements 

for fiscal year 2018  sales to five  of our worldwide distributors ingram micro inc tech data synnex corporation arrow ecs and westcon group inc represented 166  116  108  107  and 104  of our total revenues respectively our agreements with these distributors are standard nonexclusive distribution agreements that renew automatically on an annual basis and generally can be terminated by either party with 90 days written notice prior to the start of any renewal term the agreements grant ingram micro inc tech data synnex corporation arrow ecs and westcon group inc the right to distribute our products to resellers with no minimum purchase requirements 

systems integrators we also market our products through strategic relationships with systems integrators including dell services hp enterprise services and ibm global services who include our products as core components of application deployments or networkbased solutions they deploy for their customers in most cases systems integrators do not directly purchase our products for resale to their customers instead they typically recommend our products as part of broader solutions such as enterprise resource planning erp or customer relationship management crm solutions that incorporate our products for high availability and enhanced performance 

resellers and technology partners  historically our ability to compete with much larger companies has been strengthened through partnerships with large systems and software vendors currently we partner with dell and hp who resell our products and with other large technology companies including microsoft oracle vmware and cisco who recommend our products to their customers management of these relationships is the responsibility of our business development team which closely monitors technology companies in adjacent and complementary markets for opportunities to partner with those whose solutions are complementary to ours and could enable us to expand our addressable market

hardware components for our products consist primarily of commodity parts and certain custom components designed and approved by our hardware engineering group most of our components are purchased from sources which we believe are readily available from other suppliers however some components used in the assembly of our products are purchased from a single or limited source 

testing of all subassemblies and assembled systems of our products is performed at flexs facilities in zhuhai china and guadalajara mexico a small number of systems are built up to a nonfunctional state and shipped to guadalajara for configuration and final testing systems built and fulfilled in zhuhai are for distribution to apac and japan end users systems 

built in guadalajara are shipped to the flexs fulfillment center in milpitas california for distribution primarily to emea and the americas 

competition 

the expanding capabilities of our product offerings have enabled us to address a growing array of market opportunities many of which are outside the bounds of the application delivery networking market as defined and measured by industry analysts such as gartner dell’oro and others in addition to server load balancing traffic management and other functions normally associated with application delivery our suite of integrated product modules has expanded our addressable market into security and policy management where we compete with a growing number of companies not included among traditional adc vendors the ability to create customized programmable services using irules icontrol icall and similar technologies has also enabled us our customers and our partners to design solutions to problems for which there is no offtheshelf solution as a result we believe the traditional definitions of our market do not encompass all of the features functions and capabilities of our products or accurately represent the addressable market for those products 

within the more narrowly defined traditional adc market several companies sell server load balancing products and capabilities these include citrix systems inc radware ltd and a number of other competitors that have a smaller market presence or limited feature set such as a10 networks amazon web services microsoft array networks inc avi networks barracuda networks inc nginx ha proxy and kemp technologies 

in related markets we compete with companies such as the following 

 the principal competitive factors in the markets in which we compete include product features and performance customer support brand recognition the scope of distribution and sales channels and pricing certain of our competitors have employed and may in the future adopt aggressive pricing policies to gain market share however because of the superior performance broad functionality and unique capabilities of our products which have resulted in high levels of customer satisfaction and growing brand awareness we believe that we can and will compete effectively against such pricing policies 

intellectual property 

we rely on a combination of patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights f5 holds 313  patents in the united states and has 23 international patents with applications pending for various aspects of our technology our future success depends in part on our ability to protect our proprietary rights to the technologies used in our principal products despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use trade secrets or other information that we regard as proprietary in addition the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights as fully as do the laws of the united states any issued patent may not preserve our proprietary position and competitors or others may develop technologies similar to or superior to our technology our failure to enforce and protect our intellectual property rights could harm our business operating results and financial condition 

in addition to our own proprietary software we incorporate software licensed from several thirdparty sources into our products these are generally term licenses which may renew annually and that generally provide for certain rights and licenses to support our customers post termination while we may not be able to renew certain of these licenses in the future we believe that alternative technologies for these licenses are available both domestically and internationally 

employees 

as of september 30 2018  we had 4409 fulltime employees including 1268  in product development 1682 in sales and marketing 891  in professional services and technical support and 475  in accounting and finance administration and operations 

none of our employees are represented by a labor union we have experienced no work stoppages and believe that our employee relations are good

 item 1a 

risk factors 

tableend in addition to the other information in this report the following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating our company and operations 

our business could be adversely impacted by conditions affecting the information technology market 

a substantial portion of our business depends on the demand for information technology by large enterprise customers and service providers in addition to the challenges presented by new cloud computing models we are dependent upon the overall economic health of our current and prospective customers and the continued growth and evolution of the internet international national regional and local economic conditions such as recessionary economic cycles protracted economic slowdown or further deterioration of the economy could adversely impact demand for our products demand for our products and services depends substantially upon the general demand for application delivery products and associated services which fluctuates based on numerous factors including capital spending levels and growth of our current and prospective customers as well as general economic conditions moreover the purchase of our products is often discretionary and may involve a significant commitment of capital and other resources future economic projections for the information technology sector are uncertain as companies continue to reassess their spending for technology projects and embrace new models for delivery of it services such as cloud computing and highly orchestrated software defined networking environments as a result spending priorities for our current and future customers may vary and demand for our products and services may be impacted in addition customer buying patterns are changing over time and more customers seek to rent software on a subscription basis and to reduce their total cost of ownership these evolving business models could lead to changes in demand and licensing strategies which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

cloudbased computing trends present competitive and execution risks 

customers are transitioning to a hybrid computing environment utilizing various cloudbased software and services accessed via various smart client devices pricing and delivery models are evolving and our competitors are developing and deploying cloudbased services for customers in addition new cloud infrastructures are enabling the emergence of new competitors including large cloud providers who offer their own adc functionality as well as smaller companies targeting the growing numbers of born in the cloud applications we are devoting significant resources to develop and deploy our own competing cloudbased software and services strategies while we believe our expertise and investments in software and infrastructure for cloudbased services provides us with a strong foundation to compete it is uncertain whether our strategies will attract the customers or generate the revenue required to be successful in addition to software development costs we are incurring costs to build and maintain infrastructure to support cloudcomputing services these costs may reduce the operating margins we have previously achieved whether we are successful in this new business model depends on our execution in a number of areas including 

 these new business models may reduce our revenues or operating margins and could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

industry consolidation may result in increased competition 

some of our competitors have made acquisitions or entered into partnerships or other strategic relationships to offer a more comprehensive solution than they had previously offered we have also entered into large strategic partnerships to enhance our competitive position in the marketplace as it companies attempt to strengthen or maintain their market positions in the evolving application delivery mobility cloud networking and cloud platform markets these companies continue to seek to deliver comprehensive it solutions to end users and combine enterpriselevel hardware and software solutions that may compete with our solutions and which could negatively impact our partnerships these consolidators or potential consolidators may have significantly greater financial technical and other resources than we do and may be better positioned to acquire and offer complementary products and services the companies resulting from these possible combinations may create more compelling product and service offerings and be able to offer greater pricing flexibility or sales and marketing support for such offerings than we can these heightened competitive pressures could result in a loss of customers or a reduction in our revenues or revenue growth rates all of which could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

we may not be able to compete effectively in the emerging application services market 

the markets we serve are new rapidly evolving and highly competitive and we expect competition to persist and intensify in the future our principal competitors in the application services market include citrix systems inc radware ltd and a number of other competitors that have a smaller market presence or limited feature set such as a10 networks amazon 

web services microsoft array networks inc avi networks barracuda networks inc nginx ha proxy and kemp technologies 

in related markets we compete with companies such as the following 

 we expect to continue to face additional competition as new participants enter our markets as we continue to expand globally we may see new competitors in different geographic regions in addition larger companies with significant resources brand recognition and sales channels may form alliances with or acquire competing application services solutions from other companies and emerge as significant competitors potential competitors may bundle their products or incorporate an internet traffic management or security component into existing products in a manner that discourages users from purchasing our products any of these circumstances may limit our opportunities for growth and negatively impact our financial performance 

our success depends on our timely development of new products and features market acceptance of new product offerings and proper management of the timing of the life cycle of our products 

the markets for our products and services are characterized by 

 our continued success depends on our ability to identify and develop new products and new features for our existing products to meet the demands of these changes and the acceptance of those products and features by our existing and target customers in addition our products must interoperate with our end customers’ it infrastructure which often have different specifications deploy products from multiple vendors and utilize multiple protocol standards our customers’ it infrastructure is becoming more complex and we may be reliant on orchestration and interoperability with third party vendors on whom we are reliant for testing and support of new product versions and configurations if we are unable to identify develop and deploy new products and new product features on a timely basis our business and results of operations may be harmed 

the current development cycle for our products is on average 1224 months the introduction of new products or product enhancements may shorten the life cycle of our existing products or replace sales of some of our current products thereby offsetting the benefit of even a successful product introduction and may cause customers to defer purchasing our existing products in anticipation of the new products this could harm our operating results by decreasing sales increasing our inventory levels of older products and exposing us to greater risk of product obsolescence we have also experienced and may in the future experience delays in developing and releasing new products and product enhancements this has led to and may in the future lead to delayed sales increased expenses and lower quarterly revenue than anticipated also in the development of our products we have experienced delays in the prototyping of our products which in turn has led to delays in product introductions in addition complexity and difficulties in managing product transitions at the endoflife stage of a product can create excess inventory of components associated with the outgoing product that can lead to increased expenses any or all of the above problems could materially harm our business and results of operations 

our success depends on sales and continued innovation of our application delivery controller and application security product lines 

we expect to derive a significant portion of our net revenues from sales of our application delivery controller adc and application security products in the future implementation of our strategy depends upon these products being able to solve critical network availability performance and security problems for our customers if our products are unable to solve these problems for our customers or if we are unable to sustain the high levels of innovation in product feature sets needed to maintain leadership in what will continue to be a competitive market environment our business and results of operations will be harmed 

security vulnerabilities in our it systems or products as well as unforeseen product errors could have a material adverse impact on our business results of operations financial condition and reputation 

in the ordinary course of business we store sensitive data including intellectual property personal data our proprietary business information and that of our customers suppliers and business partners on our networks in addition we store sensitive data through cloudbased services that may be hosted by third parties and in data center infrastructure maintained by third parties the secure maintenance of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy our information systems and those of our partners and customers are subject to the increasing threat of intrusions by a wide range of actors including computer programmers hackers or sophisticated nationstate and nationstate supported actors or they may be compromised due to employee error or wrongful conduct malfeasance or other disruptions despite our security measures and those of our thirdparty vendors our information technology and infrastructure has experienced breaches or disruptions and may be vulnerable in the future to breach attacks or disruptions if any breach or attack compromises our networks creates system disruptions or slowdowns or exploits security vulnerabilities of our products the information stored on our networks or those of our customers could be accessed and modified publicly disclosed lost or stolen and we may be subject to liability to our customers suppliers business partners and others and suffer reputational and financial harm 

in addition our products are used to manage critical applications and data for customers and third parties may attempt to exploit security vulnerabilities in our products as well as our internal it systems as we continue to focus on the development and marketing of security solutions we become a bigger target for malicious computer hackers including sophisticated nationstate and nationstate supported actors who wish to exploit security vulnerabilities in our products or it systems 

we devote significant resources to addressing security vulnerabilities in our it systems product solutions and services through our efforts to engineer more secure solutions and services enhance security and reliability features in our solutions and services deploy security updates to address security vulnerabilities and seek to respond to known security incidents in sufficient time to minimize any potential adverse impact despite our efforts to harden our infrastructure and build secure solutions from time to time we experience attacks and other cyberthreats these attacks can seek to exploit among other things known or unknown vulnerabilities in technology included in our it infrastructure solutions and services for example in january 2018 vulnerabilities in certain microprocessors were publicly announced under the names spectre and meltdown while we have undertaken efforts to mitigate these vulnerabilities they could render our internal systems products and solutions and services susceptible to a cyberattack 

our products may also contain undetected errors or defects when first introduced or as new versions are released we have experienced these errors or defects in the past in connection with new products and product upgrades as our products and customer it infrastructures become increasingly complex customers may experience unforeseen errors in implementing our products into their it environments we expect that these errors or defects will be found from time to time in new or enhanced products after commencement of commercial shipments these problems may cause us to incur significant warranty and repair costs divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts and cause significant customer relations problems we may also be subject to liability claims for damages related to product errors or defects while we carry insurance policies covering this type of liability these policies may not provide sufficient protection should a claim be asserted a material product liability claim may harm our business and results of operations 

our products must successfully operate with products from other vendors as a result when problems occur in a network it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem the occurrence of software or hardware problems whether caused by our products or another vendor’s products may result in the delay or loss of market acceptance of our products the occurrence of any of these problems may harm our business and results of operations 

any errors defects or vulnerabilities in our products or it systems could result in 



 we are dependent on various information technology systems and failures of or interruptions to those systems could harm our business 

many of our business processes depend upon our it systems the systems and processes of third parties and on interfaces with the systems of third parties for example our order entry system provides information to the systems of our contract manufacturers which enables them to build and ship our products if those systems fail or are interrupted or if our ability to connect to or interact with one or more networks is interrupted our processes may function at a diminished level or not at all this would harm our ability to ship products and our financial results may be harmed 

in addition reconfiguring our it systems or other business processes in response to changing business needs may be timeconsuming and costly to the extent this impacted our ability to react timely to specific market or business opportunities our financial results may be harmed 

our failure to adequately protect personal information could have a material adverse effect on our business 

a wide variety of local state national and international laws directives and regulations apply to the collection use retention protection disclosure transfer and other processing of personal data these data protection and privacyrelated laws and regulations continue to evolve and may result in everincreasing regulatory and public scrutiny and escalating levels of enforcement and sanctions and increased costs of compliance certain safeharbor exemptions upon which the company relies for data transfers have been challenged and may no longer be available to us in the future our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or to protect such data could result in enforcement action against us including fines imprisonment of company officials and public censure claims for damages by endcustomers and other affected individuals damage to our reputation and loss of goodwill both in relation to existing endcustomers and prospective endcustomers any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations financial performance and business changing definitions of personal data and personal information within the european union the united states and elsewhere especially relating to classification of ip addresses machine identification location data and other information may limit or inhibit our ability to operate or expand our business including limiting strategic partnerships that may involve the sharing of data the evolving data protection regulatory environment may require significant management attention and financial resources to analyze and modify our it infrastructure to meet these changing requirements all of which could reduce our operating margins and impact our operating results and financial condition 

our success depends on our key personnel and our ability to hire retain and motivate qualified executives sales and marketing operations product development and professional services personnel 

our success depends in large part on our ability to attract engage retain and integrate qualified executives and other key employees throughout all areas of our business in order to attract and retain executives and other key employees in a competitive marketplace we must provide a competitive compensation package including cash and equitybased compensation if we do not obtain the stockholder approval needed to continue granting equity compensation in a competitive manner our ability to attract retain and motivate executives and key employees could be weakened failure to successfully hire executives and key employees or the loss of any executives and key employees could have a significant impact on our operations we have recently experienced changes in our senior leadership team including the appointment of frank pelzer as the companys chief financial officer effective may 21 2018 and chad whalen as the executive vice president of worldwide sales effective july 9 2018 and we expect to continue to see changes as we build the team that is needed to execute our strategy changes in our management team may be disruptive to our business and any failure to successfully integrate key new 

hires or promoted employees could adversely affect our business and results of operations the complexity of our products and their integration into existing networks and ongoing support as well as the sophistication of our sales and marketing effort requires us to retain highly trained developers professional services customer support and sales personnel competition for qualified developers professional services customer support and sales personnel in our industry is intense especially in silicon valley and seattle where we have substantial operations and a need for highly skilled personnel because of the limited number of people available with the necessary technical skills and understanding of our products also to the extent we hire personnel from competitors we may be subject to allegations that they have been improperly solicited that they have divulged proprietary or other confidential information that they have violated noncompete obligations to their prior employers or that their former employers own their inventions or other work product our ability to hire and retain these personnel may be adversely affected by volatility or reductions in the price of our common stock or our ability to get approval from shareholders to offer additional common stock to our employees since these employees are generally granted restricted stock units the loss of services of any of our key personnel the inability to retain and attract qualified personnel in the future or delays in hiring qualified personnel may harm our business and results of operations in addition we recently announced a restructuring to realign our workforce to match strategic and financial objectives and optimize resources for long term growth including a reduction in force program impacting a number of employees this restructuring could lead to increased attrition amongst those employees who were not directly affected by the reduction in force program 

we recently implemented a restructuring program which we cannot guarantee will achieve its intended result 

in july 2018 we announced a restructuring program to match strategic and financial objectives and optimize resources for long term growth we incur substantial costs to implement restructuring plans and our restructuring activities may subject us to litigation risks and expenses our past restructuring plans do not provide any assurance that additional restructuring plans will not be required or implemented in the future in addition our restructuring plans may have other consequences such as attrition beyond our planned reduction in workforce a negative effect on employee morale and productivity or our ability to attract highly skilled employees our competitors may also use our restructuring plans to seek to gain a competitive advantage over us as a result our restructuring plans may affect our revenue and other operating results in the future 

the average selling price of our products may decrease and our costs may increase which may negatively impact revenues and profits 

it is possible that the average selling prices of our products will decrease in the future in response to competitive pricing pressures increased sales discounts new product introductions by us or our competitors as well as the shift to more software consumption based and “as a service based” models or other factors therefore in order to maintain our profits we must develop and introduce new products and product enhancements on a timely basis and continually reduce our product costs our failure to do so could cause our revenue and profits to decline which would harm our business and results of operations in addition we may experience substantial periodtoperiod fluctuations in future operating results due to the erosion of our average selling prices 

our business may be harmed if our contract manufacturers are not able to provide us with adequate supplies of our products or if a single source of hardware assembly is lost or impaired 

we outsource the manufacturing of our hardware platforms to third party contract manufacturers who assemble these hardware platforms to our specifications we have experienced minor delays in shipments from contract manufacturers in the past however if we experience major delays in the future or other problems such as inferior quality and insufficient quantity of product any one or a combination of these factors may harm our business and results of operations the inability of our contract manufacturers to provide us with adequate supplies of our products or the loss of one or more of our contract manufacturers may cause a delay in our ability to fulfill orders while we obtain a replacement manufacturer and may harm our business and results of operations in particular we currently subcontract manufacturing of our products to a single contract manufacturer with whom we do not have a longterm contract if our arrangement with this single source of hardware assembly was terminated or otherwise impaired and we were not able to engage another contract manufacturer in a timely manner our business financial condition and results of operation could be adversely affected 

if the demand for our products grows we will need to increase our raw material and component purchases contract manufacturing capacity and internal test and quality control functions any disruptions in product flow may limit our revenue may harm our competitive position and may result in additional costs or cancellation of orders by our customers 

our business could suffer if there are any interruptions or delays in the supply of hardware components from our thirdparty sources 

we currently purchase several hardware components used in the assembly of our products from a number of single or limited sources lead times for these components vary significantly the unavailability of suitable components any 

interruption or delay in the supply of any of these hardware components or the inability to procure a similar component from alternate sources at acceptable prices within a reasonable time may delay assembly and sales of our products and hence our revenues and may harm our business and results of operations 

it is difficult to predict our future operating results because we have an unpredictable sales cycle 

our products have a lengthy sales cycle and the timing of our revenue is difficult to predict historically our sales cycle has ranged from approximately two to three months and has tended to lengthen as our products become increasingly complex also as our distribution strategy is focused on a channel model utilizing valueadded resellers distributors and systems integrators the level of variability in the length of sales cycle across transactions has increased and made it more difficult to predict the timing of many of our sales transactions sales of our products require us to educate potential customers in their use and benefits sales of our products are subject to delays from the lengthy internal budgeting approval and competitive evaluation processes that large enterprises and governmental entities may require for example customers frequently begin by evaluating our products on a limited basis and devote time and resources to testing our products before they decide whether or not to purchase customers may also defer orders as a result of anticipated releases of new products or enhancements by our competitors or us as a result our products have an unpredictable sales cycle that contributes to the uncertainty of our future operating results 

we may not be able to sustain or develop new distribution relationships and a reduction or delay in sales to significant distribution partners could hurt our business 

we sell our products and services through multiple distribution channels in the united states and internationally including leading industry distributors valueadded resellers systems integrators service providers and other indirect channel partners we have a limited number of agreements with companies in these channels and we may not be able to increase our number of distribution relationships or maintain our existing relationships recruiting and retaining qualified channel partners and training them in our technologies requires significant time and resources these channel partners may also market sell and support products and services that are competitive with ours and may devote more resources to the marketing sales and support of such competitive products our indirect sales channel structure could subject us to lawsuits potential liability and reputational harm if for example any of our channel partners misrepresent the functionality of our products or services to customers or violate laws or our corporate policies if we are unable to establish or maintain our indirect sales channels our business and results of operations will be harmed in addition five worldwide distributors of our products accounted for 601  of our total net revenue for fiscal year 2018  four worldwide distributors of our products accounted for 566  of our total net revenue for fiscal year 2017  a substantial reduction or delay in sales of our products to these distribution partners if not replaced by sales to other indirect channel partners and distributors could harm our business operating results and financial condition 

a portion of our revenue is generated by sales to government entities which are subject to a number of challenges and risks 

sales to us and foreign federal state and local governmental agency endcustomers account for a significant portion of our revenues and we may in the future increase sales to government entities sales to government entities are subject to a number of risks selling to government entities can be highly competitive expensive and time consuming often requiring significant upfront time and expense without any assurance that these efforts will generate a sale the substantial majority of our sales to date to government entities have been made indirectly through our channel partners government certification requirements for products like ours may change thereby restricting our ability to sell into the federal government sector until we have attained the revised certification government demand and payment for our products and services may be impacted by public sector budgetary cycles and funding authorizations with funding reductions or delays adversely affecting public sector demand for our products and services government entities may have statutory contractual or other legal rights to terminate contracts with our distributors and resellers for convenience or due to a default and any such termination may adversely impact our future operating results governments routinely investigate and audit government contractors’ administrative processes and any unfavorable audit could result in the government refusing to continue buying our products and services a reduction of revenue or fines or civil or criminal liability if the audit uncovers improper or illegal activities which could adversely impact our operating results in a material way finally for purchases by the us government the government may require certain products to be manufactured in the united states and other relatively high cost manufacturing locations and we may not manufacture all products in locations that meet the requirements of the us government affecting our ability to sell these products to the us government 

misuse of our products could harm our reputation 

our products may be misused by endcustomers or third parties that obtain access to our products for example our products could be used to censor private access to certain information on the internet such use of our products for censorship could result in negative publicity and damage to our reputation in addition as many of our products are subject to export control regulations diversion of our products to restricted third parties by others could result in investigations penalties fines trade restrictions and negative publicity that could damage our reputation and materially impact our business operating results and financial condition 

our quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate in future periods which may cause our stock price to fluctuate 

our quarterly and annual operating results have varied significantly in the past and could vary significantly in the future which makes it difficult for us to predict our future operating results our operating results may fluctuate due to a variety of factors many of which are outside of our control including the changing and recently volatile us and global economic environment which may cause our stock price to fluctuate in particular we anticipate that the size of customer orders may increase as we continue to focus on larger business accounts a delay in the recognition of revenue even from just one account may have a significant negative impact on our results of operations for a given period in the past a majority of our sales have been realized near the end of a quarter accordingly a delay in an anticipated sale past the end of a particular quarter may negatively impact our results of operations for that quarter or in some cases that fiscal year additionally we have exposure to the credit risks of some of our customers and subtenants although we have programs in place that are designed to monitor and mitigate the associated risk there can be no assurance that such programs will be effective in reducing our credit risks adequately we monitor individual payment capability in granting credit arrangements seek to limit the total credit to amounts we believe our customers can pay and maintain reserves we believe are adequate to cover exposure for potential losses if there is a deterioration of a subtenant’s or a major customer’s creditworthiness or actual defaults are higher than expected future losses if incurred could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our operating results further our operating results may be below the expectations of securities analysts and investors in future quarters or years our failure to meet these expectations will likely harm the market price of our common stock such a decline could occur and has occurred in the past even when we have met our publicly stated revenue andor earnings guidance 

reliance on shipments at the end of the quarter could cause our revenue for the applicable period to fall below expected levels 

as a result of customer buying patterns and the efforts of our sales force and channel partners to meet or exceed their sales objectives we have historically received a substantial portion of sales orders and generated a substantial portion of revenue during the last few weeks of each fiscal quarter in addition any significant interruption in our information technology systems which manage critical functions such as order processing revenue recognition financial forecasts inventory and supply chain management and trade compliance reviews could result in delayed order fulfillment and decreased revenue for that fiscal quarter if expected revenue at the end of any fiscal quarter is delayed for any reason including the failure of anticipated purchase orders to materialize our third party contract manufacturers’ inability to manufacture and ship products prior to fiscal quarterend to fulfill purchase orders received near the end of the fiscal quarter our failure to manage inventory to meet demand our inability to release new products on schedule any failure of our systems related to order review and processing or any delays in shipments based on trade compliance requirements our revenue for that quarter could fall below our expectations resulting in a decline in the trading price of our common stock 

changes in financial accounting standards may cause adverse unexpected revenue fluctuations and affect our reported results of operations 

a change in accounting policies can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective new pronouncements and varying interpretations of existing pronouncements have occurred with frequency and may occur in the future changes to existing rules or changes to the interpretations of existing rules could lead to changes in our accounting practices and such changes could adversely affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business 

if we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting the accuracy and timeliness of our financial reporting may be adversely affected 

as a public company we are required to design and maintain proper and effective internal controls over financial reporting and to report any material weaknesses in such internal controls section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 requires that we evaluate and determine the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting and provide a management report on the internal controls over financial reporting which must be attested to by our independent registered public accounting firm we have an ongoing program to review the design of our internal controls framework in keeping with 

changes in business needs implement necessary changes to our controls design and test the system and process controls necessary to comply with these requirements if in the future our internal controls over financial reporting are determined to be not effective resulting in a material weakness investor perceptions regarding the reliability of our financial statements may be adversely affected which could cause a decline in the market price of our stock and otherwise negatively affect our liquidity and financial condition 

we may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities 

our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely affected by nondeductible stockbased compensation changes in the research and development tax credit laws earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and being higher than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates transfer pricing adjustments not meeting the terms and conditions of tax holidays or incentives changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in actual results versus our estimates or changes in tax laws regulations accounting principles or interpretations thereof including changes to the tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals the us the european union and its member states and a number of other countries have made changes or are actively pursuing changes in this regard in addition like other companies we may be subject to examination of our income tax returns by the us internal revenue service and other tax authorities while we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes from such examinations and the adequacy of our provision for income taxes there can be no assurance that such provision is sufficient and that a determination by a tax authority will not have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

the tax cuts and jobs act enacted on december 22 2017 imposes a tax on the deemed repatriation of undistributed foreign earnings as of december 31 2017 effective january 1 2018 the new us tax law provides a deduction for the foreignsource portion of dividends received from specified foreign corporations we have recorded a tax expense for the deemed repatriation of foreign earnings as of december 31 2017 and any estimated deferred tax liabilities associated with a future repatriation of earnings to the united states these estimates are based on existing legislative provisions and regulatory guidance which are subject to change 

we are subject to governmental export and import controls that could subject us to liability or impair our ability to compete in international markets 

our products are subject to us export controls and may be exported outside the us only with the required level of export license or through an export license exception because we incorporate encryption technology into our products in addition various countries regulate the import of certain encryption technology and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute our products or our customers’ ability to implement our products in those countries changes in our products or changes in export and import regulations may create delays in the introduction of our products in international markets prevent our customers with international operations from deploying our products throughout their global systems or in some cases prevent the export or import of our products to certain countries altogether any change in export or import regulations or related legislation shift in approach to the enforcement or scope of existing regulations or change in the countries persons or technologies targeted by such regulations could result in decreased use of our products by or in our decreased ability to export or sell our products to existing or potential customers with international operations any decreased use of our products or limitation on our ability to export or sell our products would likely adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property and our products may infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties 

we rely on a combination of patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure of confidential and proprietary information to protect our intellectual property rights despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology monitoring unauthorized use of our products is difficult and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of our technology particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 

our industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the ordinary course of our business we are involved in disputes and licensing discussions with others regarding their claimed proprietary rights and cannot provide assurance that we will always successfully defend ourselves against such claims and such matters are subject to many uncertainties and outcomes are not predictable with assurance we expect that infringement claims may increase as the number of products and competitors in our market increases and overlaps occur also as we have gained greater visibility market exposure and competitive success we face a higher risk of being the subject of intellectual property infringement claims if we are found to infringe the proprietary rights of others or if we otherwise settle such claims we could be compelled to pay damages or royalties and either obtain a 

license to those intellectual property rights or alter our products so that they no longer infringe upon such proprietary rights any license could be very expensive to obtain or may not be available at all or may require us to make royalty payments which could adversely affect gross margins in future periods the actual liability in any such matters may be materially different from our estimate if any which could result in the need to adjust the liability and record additional expenses similarly changing our products or processes to avoid infringing upon the rights of others may be costly or impractical in addition we have initiated and may in the future initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to determine the scope and validity of our proprietary rights or those of our competitors any of these claims whether claims that we are infringing the proprietary rights of others or vice versa with or without merit may be timeconsuming result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel or require us to cease using infringing technology develop noninfringing technology or enter into royalty or licensing agreements further our license agreements typically require us to indemnify our customers distributors and resellers for infringement actions related to our technology which could cause us to become involved in infringement claims made against our customers distributors or resellers any of the abovedescribed circumstances relating to intellectual property rights disputes could result in our business and results of operations being harmed 

we incorporate open source software into our products although we monitor our use of open source closely the terms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by us courts and there is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products we could also be subject to similar conditions or restrictions should there be any changes in the licensing terms of the open source software incorporated into our products in either event we could be required to seek licenses from third parties in order to continue offering our products to reengineer our products or to discontinue the sale of our products in the event reengineering cannot be accomplished on a timely or successful basis any of which could adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

many of our products include intellectual property licensed from third parties in the future it may be necessary to renew licenses for third party intellectual property or obtain new licenses for other technology these third party licenses may not be available to us on acceptable terms if at all the inability to obtain certain licenses or litigation regarding the interpretation or enforcement of license rights and related intellectual property issues could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition furthermore we license some third party intellectual property on a nonexclusive basis and this may limit our ability to protect our intellectual property rights in our products 

our operating results are exposed to risks associated with international commerce 

as our international sales increase our operating results become more exposed to international operating risks additionally our international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks including the following 



in addition in june 2016 voters in the united kingdom approved an advisory referendum to withdraw from the european union commonly referred to as brexit subsequently in march 2017 the united kingdoms government invoked article 50 of the treaty on european union which formally triggered the twoyear negotiation process to exit the european union the uncertainty surrounding the terms of the united kingdoms withdrawal and its consequences may cause our customers to closely monitor their costs and reduce their spending on our products and services 

we must hire and train experienced personnel to staff and manage our foreign operations to the extent that we experience difficulties in recruiting training managing and retaining an international staff and specifically staff related to sales management and sales personnel we may experience difficulties in sales productivity in foreign markets we also enter into strategic distributor and reseller relationships with companies in certain international markets where we do not have a local presence if we are not able to maintain successful strategic distributor relationships internationally or recruit additional companies to enter into strategic distributor relationships our future success in these international markets could be limited business practices in the international markets that we serve may differ from those in the united states and may require us in the future to include terms other than our standard terms in customer contracts we intend to continue expanding into international markets sales outside of the americas represented 443  and 433  of our net revenues for the fiscal years ended september 30 2018  and 2017  respectively 

these factors and other factors could harm our ability to gain future international revenues and consequently materially impact our business operating results and financial condition the expansion of our existing international operations and entry into additional international markets will require significant management attention and financial resources our failure to successfully manage our international operations and the associated risks effectively could limit the future growth of our business 

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates which could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our sales contracts are denominated in us dollars and therefore substantially all of our revenue is not subject to foreign currency risk however a strengthening of the us dollar could increase the real cost of our solutions to our end customers outside of the united states which could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results in addition an increasing portion of our operating expenses is incurred outside the united states is denominated in foreign currencies and is subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates if we become more exposed to currency fluctuations and are not able to successfully hedge against the risks associated with currency fluctuations our operating results could be adversely affected to date we have not entered into any hedging arrangements with respect to foreign currency risk or other derivative instruments 

changes in governmental regulations could negatively affect our revenues 

many of our products are subject to various regulations promulgated by the united states and various foreign governments including but not limited to environmental regulations and regulations implementing export license requirements and restrictions on the import or export of some technologies especially encryption technology changes in governmental regulation and our inability or failure to obtain required approvals permits or registrations could harm our international and domestic sales and adversely affect our revenues business and operations 

new regulations related to conflict minerals may force us to incur additional expenses and could limit the supply and increase the costs of certain metals and minerals used in the manufacturing of our products 

in august 2012 the sec adopted new requirements under the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 or the doddfrank act for companies that use certain minerals and derivative metals referred to as conflict minerals regardless of their country of origin in their products whether or not these products are manufactured by third parties the doddfrank act requires companies to perform due diligence and disclose whether or not such minerals originate from the democratic republic of congo or adjoining countries we filed a report on form sd with the sec regarding such matters on may 31 2018 these requirements could adversely affect the sourcing availability and pricing of minerals or metals used in the manufacture of our products and the numerous components that go into our products all of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results in addition we will incur additional costs to comply with the disclosure requirements including costs related to determining the source of any relevant minerals and metals used in our products we have a complex supply chain and many components are sourced through our contract manufacturer and we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins for these minerals and metals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement as a result we may face reputational challenges with our customers and other stakeholders and possible regulatory risk 

we face litigation risks 

we are a party to lawsuits in the normal course of our business litigation in general and intellectual property and securities litigation in particular can be expensive lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations moreover the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict responding to lawsuits has been and will likely continue to be expensive and timeconsuming for us an unfavorable resolution of these lawsuits could adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

acquisitions present many risks and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that are contemplated at the time of the transaction 

with respect to our past acquisitions as well as any other future acquisitions we may undertake we may find that the acquired businesses products or technologies do not further our business strategy as expected that we paid more than what the assets are later worth or that economic conditions change all of which may generate future impairment charges our acquisitions may be viewed negatively by customers financial markets or investors there may be difficulty integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired business and we may have difficulty retaining the key personnel of the acquired business we may have difficulty in integrating the acquired technologies or products with our existing product lines our ongoing business and management’s attention may be disrupted or diverted by transition or integration issues and the complexity of managing geographically and culturally diverse locations we may have difficulty maintaining uniform standards controls procedures and policies across locations we may experience significant problems or liabilities associated with product quality technology and other matters 

our inability to successfully operate and integrate newlyacquired businesses appropriately effectively and in a timely manner or to retain key personnel of any acquired business could have a material adverse effect on our ability to take advantage of further growth in demand for integrated traffic management and security solutions and other advances in technology as well as on our revenues gross margins and expenses 

antitakeover provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us 

our board of directors has the authority to issue up to 10000000 shares of preferred stock and to determine the price rights preferences privileges and restrictions including voting rights of those shares without any further vote or action by the shareholders the rights of the holders of common stock may be subject to and may be adversely affected by the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future the issuance of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a change of control of our company without further action by our shareholders and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of the holders of common stock further certain provisions of our bylaws including a provision limiting the ability of shareholders to raise matters at a meeting of shareholders without giving advance notice may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or management of our company which could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock similarly state antitakeover laws in the state of washington related to corporate takeovers may prevent or delay a change of control of our company 

our stock price could be volatile particularly during times of economic uncertainty and volatility in domestic and international stock markets 

our stock price has been volatile and has fluctuated significantly in the past the trading price of our stock is likely to continue to be volatile and subject to fluctuations in the future some of the factors that could significantly affect the market price of our stock include 

 the stock market in general and the market for technology companies in particular have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations these fluctuations have often been unrelated or disproportionate to operating performance the fluctuations may continue in the future and this could significantly impact the value of our stock and your investment 

if securities or industry analysts publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business or discontinue publishing research about our business the price and trading volume of our securities could decline 

the trading market for our common stock is influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us our business our market or our competitors if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our common stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business the price of our securities would likely decline if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly demand for our securities could decrease which might cause the price and trading volume of our securities to decline 

we face risks associated with having operations and employees located in israel 

we have offices and employees located in israel as a result political economic and military conditions in israel directly affect our operations the future of peace efforts between israel and its arab neighbors remains uncertain there has been a significant increase in hostilities and political unrest in israel in the past year the effects of these hostilities and violence on the israeli economy and our operations in israel are unclear and we cannot predict the effect on us of further increases in these hostilities or future armed conflict political instability or violence in the region in addition many of our employees in israel are obligated to perform annual reserve duty in the israeli military and are subject to being called for active duty under emergency circumstances we cannot predict the full impact of these conditions on us in the future particularly if emergency circumstances or an escalation in the political situation occurs if many of our employees in israel are called for active duty for a significant period of time our operations and our business could be disrupted and may not be able to function at full capacity current or future tensions and conflicts in the middle east could adversely affect our business operating results financial condition and cash flows 

our business is subject to the risks of earthquakes fire power outages floods and other catastrophic events and to interruption by manmade problems such as terrorism 

a significant natural disaster such as an earthquake a fire a flood or a significant power outage could have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition we have an administrative and product development office and a third party contract manufacturer located in the san francisco bay area a region known for seismic activity in addition natural disasters could affect our supply chain manufacturing vendors or logistics providers’ ability to provide materials and perform services such as manufacturing products or assisting with shipments on a timely basis in the event our or our service providers’ information technology systems or manufacturing or logistics abilities are hindered by any of the events discussed above shipments could be delayed resulting in missed financial targets such as revenue and shipment targets for a particular quarter in addition cyberattacks acts of terrorism or other geopolitical unrest could cause disruptions in our business or the business of our supply chain manufacturers logistics providers partners or endcustomers or the economy as a whole any disruption in the business of our supply chain manufacturers logistics providers partners or endcustomers that impacts sales at the end of a fiscal quarter could have a significant adverse impact on our quarterly results all of the aforementioned risks may be further increased if the disaster recovery plans for us and our suppliers prove to be inadequate to the extent that any of the above should result in delays or cancellations of customer orders or the delay in the manufacture deployment or shipment of our products our business financial condition and operating results would be adversely affected 

in addition to other risks listed in this “risk factors” section factors that may affect our operating results include but are not limited to

due to growth in the amount of annual maintenance contracts purchased on new products and maintenance renewal contracts related to our existing product installation base our days sales outstanding for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018  was 47  

critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we believe that of our significant accounting policies which are described in note 1 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity accordingly these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 

revenue recognition we sell products through distributors resellers and directly to end users revenue is recognized provided that all of the following criteria have been met 

 revenue from the sale of products is generally recognized when the product has been shipped and the customer is obligated to pay for the product when rights of return are present and we cannot estimate returns revenue is recognized when such rights of return lapse payment terms to domestic customers are generally net 30 days to net 45 days payment terms to international customers range from net 30 days to net 120 days based on normal and customary trade practices in the individual markets 

revenues for postcontract customer support pcs are recognized on a straightline basis over the service contract term pcs includes a limited period of telephone support updates repair or replacement of any failed product or component that fails during the term of the agreement bug fixes and rights to upgrades when and if available consulting services are customarily billed at fixed hourly rates plus outofpocket expenses and revenues are recognized when the consulting has been completed training revenue is recognized when the training has been completed 

arrangement consideration is first allocated between software consisting of nonessential and standalone software and nonsoftware deliverables the majority of our products are hardware appliances which contain software essential to the overall functionality of the products hardware appliances are generally sold with pcs and on occasion with consulting andor training services arrangement consideration in such multiple element transactions is allocated to each element based on a fair value hierarchy where the selling price for an element is based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe if available thirdparty evidence tpe if available and vsoe is not available or the best estimate of selling price besp if neither vsoe or tpe is available 

for software deliverables we allocate revenue between multiple elements based on software revenue recognition guidance software revenue recognition guidance requires revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements to be allocated to each element based on the relative fair values of those elements the fair value of an element must be based on vsoe where fair value of delivered elements is not available revenue is recognized on the “residual method” based on the fair value of undelivered elements if evidence of fair value of one or more undelivered elements does not exist all revenue is deferred and recognized at the earlier of the delivery of those elements or the establishment of fair value of the remaining undelivered elements 

we establish vsoe for our products pcs consulting and training services based on the sales price charged for each element when sold separately the sales price is discounted from the applicable list price based on various factors including the type of customer volume of sales geographic region and program level our list prices are generally not fair value as discounts 

may be given based on the factors enumerated above we use historical sales transactions to determine whether vsoe can be established for each of the elements in most instances vsoe of fair value is the sales price of actual standalone unbundled transactions within the past 12 month period when a substantial majority of transactions more than 80 are priced within a narrow range which we have determined to be plus or minus 15 of the median sales price 

we believe that the vsoe of fair value of training and consulting services is represented by the billable rate per hour based on the rates charged to customers when they purchase standalone training or consulting services the price of consulting services is not based on the type of customer volume of sales geographic region or program level 

we are typically not able to determine vsoe or tpe for nonsoftware products tpe is determined based on competitor prices for similar elements when sold separately generally our gotomarket strategy differs from that of other competitive products or services in its markets and our offerings contain a significant level of differentiation such that the comparable pricing of products with similar functionality cannot be obtained furthermore we are unable to reliably determine the selling prices on a standalone basis of similar products offered by our competitors 

when we are unable to establish selling price using vsoe or tpe we use besp in our allocation of arrangement consideration the objective of besp is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a standalone basis we have been able to establish besp through the list price less a discount deemed appropriate to maintain a reasonable gross margin management regularly reviews gross margin information at the consolidated level nonsoftware product besp is determined through our review of historical sales transactions within the past 12 month period additional factors considered in determining an appropriate besp include but are not limited to cost of products pricing practices geographies customer classes and distribution channels 

we regularly validate the vsoe of fair value and besp for elements in its multiple element arrangements we account for taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities on a net basis and excluded these amounts from revenues 

accounting for income taxes we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure including assessing the risks associated with tax audits together with assessing temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities due to the evolving nature and complexity of tax rules combined with the large number of jurisdictions in which we operate it is possible that our estimates of our tax liability could change in the future which may result in additional tax liabilities and adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

results of operations 

the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

  



net revenues total net revenues increased 34  in fiscal year 2018  from fiscal year 2017  compared to an increase of 48  in fiscal year 2017  from the prior year overall revenue growth for the year ended september 30 2018  was primarily due to increased service revenues as a result of our increased installed base of products international revenues represented 496  486  and 489  of net revenues in fiscal years 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively we expect international sales will continue to represent a significant portion of net revenues although we cannot provide assurance that international revenues as a percentage of net revenues will remain at current levels 

net product revenues decreased 05  in fiscal year 2018  from fiscal year 2017  compared to a increase of 21  in fiscal year 2017  from the prior year the decrease  of 46 million  in net product sales for fiscal year 2018  was due to a decrease in systems revenue partially offset by an increase in software revenue the increase of 202 million  in net product sales for fiscal year 2017  was primarily due to an increase of 277 million  in sales of our application services solutions growth in sales of our softwareonly virtual editions contributed to the increase in product revenue for fiscal year 2017 

net service revenues increased   67  in fiscal year 2018  from fiscal year 2017  compared to an increase of 71  in fiscal year 2017  from the prior year the increases in service revenue were the result of increased purchases or renewals of maintenance contracts driven by additions to our installed base of products 

the following distributors of our products accounted for more than 10 of total net revenue 



 the following distributors of our products accounted for more than 10 of total receivables 

  



 no other distributors accounted for more than 10 of total net revenue or receivables   



cost of net product revenues cost of net product revenues consist of finished products purchased from our contract manufacturers manufacturing overhead freight warranty provisions for excess and obsolete inventory and amortization expenses in connection with developed technology from acquisitions cost of net product revenues increased  to 1811 million  in fiscal year 2018  up 29  from the prior year primarily due to an increase in payments to our contract manufacturers due to

however research and development headcount at the end of fiscal year 2017  decreased to 1192  from 1211  at the end of fiscal year 2016  due to a reduction in workforce that took place in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017  research and development expense included stockbased compensation expense of 473 million  534 million  and 526 million  for fiscal years 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively we expect research and development expenses to be consistent as a percentage of net revenue in the foreseeable future

other income net other income net consists primarily of interest income and foreign currency transaction gains and losses other income net increased   13 million  in fiscal year 2018  as compared to fiscal year 2017  and increased 90 million  in fiscal year 2017  as compared to fiscal year 2016  interest income was 170 million  85 million  and 66 million  for fiscal years 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively the increase in other income net for fiscal year 2018  was primarily due to an increase of 85 million  in interest income compared to the prior year partially offset by foreign currency losses of 75 million  compared to the prior year the increase in other income net for fiscal year 2017  as compared to fiscal year 2016  was primarily due to 70 million  in foreign currency gains compared to the prior year 

provision for income taxes we recorded a 249  provision for income taxes for fiscal year 2018  compared to 269  in fiscal year 2017  and 335  in fiscal year 2016  the decrease in the effective tax rate from fiscal year 2017 to 2018 was primarily due to the impacts of the tax cuts and jobs act enacted on december 22 2017 partially offset with foreign tax 

credits from a one time distribution in fiscal year 2017 significant impacts of the tax cuts and jobs act include a reduction in the us federal income tax rate from 35 to 245 partially offset with a tax on the deemed repatriation of undistributed foreign earnings and a remeasurement of our net deferred tax assets several provisions of the tax cuts and jobs act are not effective for us until fiscal year 2019 including a further reduction in the us federal income tax rate to 21 a deduction for foreign derived intangible income repeal of the deduction for income attributable to domestic production activities and a tax on global intangible lowtaxed income the decrease in the effective tax rate from fiscal year 2016 to 2017 was primarily due to the impact of foreign income and foreign tax credits from a one time distribution of prior year foreign earnings partially offset with a benefit recorded in fiscal year 2016 from the retroactive extension of the united states federal credit for increasing research activities 

we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount we believe is morelikelythannot to be realized in making these determinations we consider historical and projected taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the appropriateness of a valuation allowance the net increase in the valuation allowance of 46 million  for fiscal year 2018 and 36 million  for fiscal year 2017 was primarily related to tax net operating losses incurred in certain foreign jurisdictions and state tax credit carryforwards our net deferred tax assets as of september 30 2018  2017  and 2016  were 334 million  532 million  and 494 million  respectively 

our worldwide effective tax rate may fluctuate based on a number of factors including variations in projected taxable income in the various geographic locations in which we operate changes in the valuation of our net deferred tax assets resolution of potential exposures tax positions taken on tax returns filed in the various geographic locations in which we operate and the introduction of new accounting standards or changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof in the various geographic locations in which we operate we have recorded liabilities to address potential tax exposures related to business and income tax positions we have taken that could be challenged by taxing authorities the ultimate resolution of these potential exposures may be greater or less than the liabilities recorded which could result in an adjustment to our future tax expense 

liquidity and capital resources 

we have funded our operations with our cash balances cash generated from operations and proceeds from public offerings of our securities 

  



cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and longterm investments totaled 14506 million  as of september 30 2018  compared to 13017 million  as of september 30 2017  representing an increase of 1489 million  the increase was primarily due to cash provided by operating activities of 7611 million  partially offset by 6001 million  of cash required for the repurchase of outstanding common stock under our share repurchase program in fiscal year 2018  and 535 million  of capital expenditures related to the expansion of our facilities to support our operations worldwide as of september 30 2018  376  of our cash and cash equivalents and investment balances were outside of the us the cash and cash equivalents and investment balances outside of the us are subject to fluctuation based on the settlement of intercompany balances in fiscal year 2017  the increase to cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and longterm investments from the prior year was primarily due to cash provided by operating activities of 7403 million  partially offset by 6001 million of cash required for the repurchase of outstanding common stock under our share repurchase program in fiscal year 2017 and 387 million  of capital expenditures related to the expansion of our facilities to support our operations worldwide as of september 30 2017  377  of our cash and cash equivalents and investment balances were outside of the us 

cash provided by operating activities during fiscal year 2018  was 7611 million  compared to 7403 million  in fiscal year 2017  and 7115 million  in fiscal year 2016  cash provided by operating activities resulted primarily from cash generated from net income after adjusting for noncash charges such as stockbased compensation depreciation and amortization charges and changes in operating assets and liabilities 

cash used in investing activities during fiscal year 2018  was 4560 million  compared to cash used in investing activities of 323 million  in fiscal year 2017  and cash provided by investing activities of 627 million  in fiscal year 2016  cash used in investing activities for fiscal year 2018  was primarily the result of the purchase of investments and capital expenditures related to maintaining our operations worldwide partially offset by the sale and maturity of investments cash used in investing activities for fiscal year 2017  was primarily the result of the purchase of investments and capital expenditures related to maintaining our operations worldwide partially offset by the sale and maturity of investments cash provided by investing activities for fiscal year 2016  was primarily the result of the sale and maturity of investments partially offset by the purchase of investments and capital expenditures related to the expansion of our facilities to support our operations worldwide 

cash used in financing activities was 5513 million  for fiscal year 2018  compared to 5460 million  for fiscal year 2017  and 6526 million  for fiscal year 2016  cash used in financing activities for fiscal year 2018  included 6001 million  to repurchase common stock under our share repurchase program which was partially offset by cash received from the exercise of employee stock options and stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan of 488 million  cash used in financing activities for fiscal year 2017  included 6001 million  to repurchase common stock under our share repurchase program which was partially offset by cash received from the exercise of employee stock options and stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan of 470 million  and excess tax benefits related to sharebased compensation of 70 million  cash used in financing activities for fiscal year 2016  included 7001 million  to repurchase common stock under our share repurchase program which was partially offset by cash received from the exercise of employee stock options and stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan of 449 million  and excess tax benefits related to sharebased compensation of 26 million  

based on our current operating and capital expenditure forecasts we believe that our existing cash and investment balances together with cash generated from operations should be sufficient to meet our operating requirements for the next twelve months our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our rate of revenue growth the expansion of our sales and marketing activities the timing and extent of expansion into new territories the timing of introductions of new products and enhancements of existing products and the continuing market acceptance of our products 

obligations and commitments 

the following table summarizes our contractual payment obligations and commitments as of september 30 2018

as of september 30 2018  we had approximately 333 million  of tax liabilities including interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions see note 5 to our consolidated financial statements because of the high degree of uncertainty regarding the settlement of these liabilities we are unable to estimate the years in which future cash outflows may occur 

purchase obligations are comprised of purchase commitments with our contract manufacturers the agreement with our primary contract manufacturer allows it to procure component inventory on our behalf based on our production forecast we are obligated to purchase component inventory that the contract manufacturer procures in accordance with the forecast unless cancellation is given within applicable lead times

we adopted asu 201609 during the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies from sharebased compensation are now recorded to the consolidated income statements rather than to additional paidin capital within equity on a prospective basis we recognized 76 million  of tax benefits for the fiscal year ended september 30 2018 we also elected to prospectively apply the change in presentation requirement wherein excess tax benefits of awards are classified as operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows prior periods have not been reclassified to conform to the fiscal 2018 presentation 

we did not elect an accounting policy change to record forfeitures as they occur and will continue to estimate forfeitures at each period

comparative periods the new standard is effective at the same time as adoption of asu 201602 leases topic 842 which we are planning to adopt in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020   we anticipate our longterm leases for office space will be recognized as lease liabilities and corresponding rightofuse assets and will accordingly have a material impact on our consolidated balance sheets upon adoption   

in june 2016 the fasb issued asu 201613 financial instruments  credit losses topic 326 measurement of credit losses on financial instruments  asu 201613 which replaces the incurred loss impairment methodology in current gaap with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses the new standard is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after december 15 2019 early adoption is permitted we do not anticipate that the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

tableend interest rate risk our cash equivalents consist of highquality securities as specified in our investment policy guidelines the policy limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue or issuer to a maximum of 5  of the total portfolio with the exception of us treasury and agency securities commercial paper and money market funds which are exempt from size limitation the policy requires investments in securities that mature in three years or less with the average maturity being no greater than one and a half years these securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if interest rates increase a decrease of one percent in the average interest rate would have resulted in a decrease of approximately 95 million  in our interest income for the fiscal year 2018  

  



foreign currency risk the majority of our sales and expenses are denominated in us dollars and as a result we have not experienced significant foreign currency transaction gains and losses to date while we have conducted some transactions in foreign currencies during the fiscal year ended september 30 2018  and expect to continue to do so we do not anticipate that foreign currency transaction gains or losses will be significant at our current level of operations however as we continue to expand our operations internationally transaction gains or losses may become significant in the future we have not engaged in foreign currency hedging to date however we may do so in the future

industry background 

growth and evolution of ipbased infrastructures 

internet protocol ip is a communications language used to deliver applications and data over the internet for more than two decades large business and government organizations have been gradually replacing older data center architectures with ipbased infrastructures deploying new ipbased applications and replacing or upgrading legacy applications with new ipenabled versions this trend has been accompanied by the proliferation of mobile devices such as smartphones tablets and laptops that allow users to access data and applications from almost anywhere at the same time virtualization of data centers and networks and the emergence of public clouds have given rise to dynamic hybrid infrastructures where applications are increasingly hosted offpremises as well as in traditional data centers and can move freely between locations as demand or other circumstances require 

emergence of the dynamic data center and hybrid it infrastructures 

from a broad perspective the goal of it organizations is to optimize the secure delivery of applications to users wherever they are and whenever they need them regardless of where those applications exist 

dynamic data center  server virtualization has enabled organizations to group or partition data center compute resources to meet user demand dynamically and reconfigure these virtual resources easily and quickly as demand changes more recently softwaredefined networking sdn offers organizations a means to reduce costs increase the flexibility and simplify the deployment and management of it infrastructure through network virtualization f5 products play key roles in application delivery and security in both environments where compute is virtualized and the network is virtualized 

hybrid it infrastructures  many organizations are also taking advantage of the growing availability of internalexternal private and public cloud resources as a flexible secure and reliable alternative to owning and managing static infrastructure components directly f5 state of application delivery soad and other studies show that customers are increasingly moving towards hybrid it or even multicloud architectures where applications onpremise must coexist and collaborate with applications in the cloud f5 solutions can simplify the deployment delivery security and management of applications in such hybrid environments 

at the same time these changes have created new challenges to the security of ip networks and the applications and data accessible over the internet with increasing frequency sophisticated denialofservice attacks have exposed a major vulnerability in the security perimeter of corporate networks by overwhelming firewalls and effectively shutting down the networks in addition many networklevel security threats are directly related to the improper use of the same protocols applications depend on to transmit data intrusion detection and prevention devices which rely on signature databases of known threats afford some protection against these types of attacks however they offer no protection against many of the most common threats including information leakage content spoofing crosssite request forgery or “zeroday” attacks designed to exploit a variety of application vulnerabilities 

in addition to preventing the threat of attacks designed to disrupt destroy or block access to network applications organizations are faced with the equally daunting challenge of controlling access to applications and data the proliferation of mobile devices has given users with smart phones tablets and laptops the ability to access corporate private and public cloud data centers from virtually anywhere this in turn has increased the difficulty of ensuring that mobile users are able to access applications and data for which they are authorized and that applications and data are protected from access by unauthorized users 

need to optimize the secure delivery of applications and data 

with the ongoing evolution and increasing complexity of it infrastructures there is a growing need to optimize the secure delivery of applications and data over ip networks ipbased traffic passing between enduser devices servers and cloud resources is divided into discrete packets that travel by multiple routes to their destination where they are reassembled the basic disassembly routing and reassembly of transmissions are relatively straightforward and require limited intelligence by contrast managing inspecting modifying redirecting and securing application traffic going to and from servers can require highly intelligent systems capable of performing an expanding array of functions broadly speaking all of those functions are aspects of application delivery 

application delivery services dynamically manage secure and optimize the flow of traffic between users and servers physical or virtual and cloud environments freeing up other resources by offloading common network functions such as encryption ipv4ipv6 translation compression authentication rateshaping and a variety of specialized functions including network and application security services policy management and wan optimization that would otherwise have to be coded into applications since most large enterprises have hundreds — if not thousands — of applications it isnt practical to replicate these functions within each instance of an application and maintain consistent policies across a broad spectrum of different 

applications in traditional data centers it has been common practice to deploy an array of point products in front of server farms to provide various services but that typically requires integrating maintaining and upgrading disparate technologies from different vendors a process that is timeconsuming and expensive in terms of both capital and operating costs from a security standpoint it is also much more difficult to audit traffic passing through multiple devices in such environments a more practical and efficient solution is a comprehensive set of integrated application delivery services on a single highperformance device in virtual and cloud environments where flexibility is a priority software designed to run on standard hypervisors provides the same services and many of the benefits associated with hardwarebased solutions 

although application delivery services are broadly applicable within enterprise and service provider it infrastructures service providers face unique challenges as they attempt to modernize and scale their networks to deal with the flood of data generated by smart phones tablets wearables and other mobile devices to cope with these challenges many service providers are still migrating legacy 2g3g infrastructures to 4glte networks and evolved packet core epc data centers that require an array of network and application services today most of those services are deployed on separate appliances from different vendors and service providers are actively seeking solutions that will enable them to lower costs and improve reliability and performance by consolidating services and reducing the number of devices increasingly they are also demanding software solutions designed to run on commodity hardware that can be repurposed as needed to cope with the dramatic increase in signaling traffic associated with 4glte networks the challenges of migrating legacy infrastructure and the need to integrate charging and enforcement functions with subscriber data service providers have also adopted the diameter signaling protocol as the de facto standard for communication within their evolving data centers 

f5’s strategy 

our goal is to lead the industry in providing ip network services that ensure the safe fast and reliable delivery of applications to any user anywhere anytimeregardless of a users location or where the application resides these services include availability security performance mobility and identity they also include managing and orchestrating resources as well as coordinating services across multiple data centers networks and cloudbased resources our products are designed to provide strategic points of control throughout the it infrastructure that allow business policies to be implemented where information is exchanged key components of our strategy include 

offering a complete integrated suite of application services 

since the introduction of tmos we have developed tmosbased versions of our own legacy products such as local traffic manager ltm bigip dns and link controller newer products such as advanced firewall manager afm carrier grade network address translation cgnat and policy enforcement manager pem and products that incorporate acquired technology including application security manager asm access policy manager apm and our enduser protection services websafe and mobilesafe all of these products are currently available as integrated software modules on our bigip and viprion hardware and as virtual editions that run on standard hypervisors in 2016 we introduced our first standalone security appliances ddos hybrid defender and ssl orchestrator in addition we offer online ddos protection and application security as subscription services on our cloudbased silverline saas platform regardless whether these services are deployed as softwareonly solutions or as modules running on our purposebuilt hardware our bigiq management platform allows customers to apply and update consistent policies across their f5 services from a centralized resource we believe this approach addresses the needs of todays evolving hybrid infrastructures and sharply differentiates our products from our competitors’ offerings 

investing in technology to meet evolving customer needs 

we meet with our customers often and maintain a customer advisory board to ensure that our development efforts are aligned with their needs we continue to invest in research and development efforts that leverage the unique attributes of our tmos platform as well as new technologies to deliver new features and functions that address the complex changing needs of our customers although the bulk of our investment is software development concurrent development of tightly integrated hardware that delivers consistent guaranteed highperformance continues to be an appreciable element of our investment strategy we also look for opportunities to acquire technologies that will enable us to broaden the scope of our offerings and expand into adjacent markets 

expanding our addressable market 

since the introduction of tmos we have continually expanded our addressable market and the definition of application delivery through the acquisition and development of new technology in 2003 for example we entered the market for secure remote access through the acquisition of uroam inc and its firepass ssl vpn technology that has become the core of our current access policy manager apm offering the following year we entered the web application firewall market with the acquisition of magnifire websystems inc and its trafficshield security appliance which became the foundation of our application security manager asm product in 2013 we introduced advanced firewall manager afm enabling enhanced network firewall capabilities in 2013 we also continued to expand our security offerings with the acquisition of versafe a provider of web antifraud antiphishing and antimalware solutions and in 2014 we acquired defensenet a cloudbased ddos protection service that complements our onpremise ddos solution and is currently available on our silverline saas platform during fiscal year 2016 we added new standalone security appliances ddos defender and ssl orchestrator to our family of security productscurrently available within our herculon product line these products are components of our comprehensive approach to application security and integrate with other features and functions available on our products as a result of this strategy and our development and acquisition of technology in related markets such as java script programing analytics ddos protection and web application firewalls we believe our current addressable market is significantly broader and more diverse than the adc market as industry analysts have historically defined it 

continuing to build and expand relationships with strategic technology partners 

early on we developed strategic technology partnerships with enterprise software vendors such as microsoft oracle vmware and others who had an established presence in large enterprises by taking advantage of icontrol our open application programming interface and icall a scripting framework that provides the ability to define data plane events such as threshold breaches and adjust the behavior of our products accordingly these vendors have been able to equip their applications and technologies to better interoperate with our products in the network enhancing overall application performance in return they provided us significant leverage in the selling process by recommending our products to their customers more recently we have worked closely with several of these vendors to develop configurations of our products called iapps that are specifically designed to simplify deployment and optimize the performance of their applications these solutions are available as templates which allow quick and easy configuration of our products for specific applications 

in recent years we have developed partnerships with cisco hp microsoft and vmware to provide integrated application services for their softwaredefined networking sdn offerings in addition we have advanced partnership efforts around amazon aws microsoft azure google cloud platform vmware vcloud cisco aci and many other technologies to provide cloudbased application services and solutions for customers we plan to continue building on our existing relationships and to extend our competitive edge by developing new strategic partnerships with other technology leaders and emerging players 

leveraging devcentral our online community of network architects and developers 

customization of our products capabilities via irules irules lx and related technologies enhances their “stickiness” by allowing customers to solve problems in both their applications and their networks that would be difficult if not impossible to solve by other means our online community devcentral lets customers and partners discuss and share the ways in which they use f5s programmable technologies to solve problems and enhance the security performance and availability of applications a corollary benefit is that a number of the solutions posted by devcentral participants have become standard features in newer releases of tmos devcentral also provides a valuable window into our customers’ constantly evolving needs that helps guide product development efforts

our customers include a wide variety of enterprises and service providers among fortune 1000 and business week global 1000 companies including those in technology telecommunications financial services transportation education manufacturing and healthcare along with government customers in fiscal year 2017  sales outside of the americas represented 433  of our net revenues refer to note 10 of our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding our revenues by geographic area 

sales and marketing 

sales 

we sell our products and services to large enterprise customers and service providers through a variety of channels including distributors valueadded resellers vars and systems integrators a substantial amount of our revenue for fiscal year 2017  was derived from these channel sales our sales teams work closely with our channel partners and also sell our products and services directly to major accounts 

f5 sales teams our inside sales team generates and qualifies leads for regional sales managers and helps manage accounts by serving as a liaison between the field and internal corporate resources our field sales personnel are located in major cities in four sales regions the americas primarily the united states europe the middle east and africa emea japan and the asia pacific region apac field sales personnel work closely with our channel partners to assist them as necessary in the sale of our products and services to their customers we also sell our products and services directly to customers primarily large enterprises whose accounts are managed by our major account team field systems engineers support our regional sales managers and channel partners by participating in joint sales calls and providing presale technical resources as needed 

distributors and vars as a key component of our sales strategy we have established relationships with a number of large national and international distributors local and specialized distributors and vars we derive a majority of our product sales from vars and rely on our large distributors primarily for fulfillment 

our agreements with these channel partners are not exclusive and do not prevent them from selling competitive products these agreements typically have terms of one year with no obligation to renew and typically do not provide for exclusive sales territories or minimum purchase requirements 

for fiscal year 2017  sales to four of our worldwide distributors westcon group inc ingram micro inc tech data and arrow ecs represented 177  161  124  and 104  of our total revenues respectively our agreements with these distributors are standard nonexclusive distribution agreements that renew automatically on an annual basis and generally can be terminated by either party with 30 days written notice prior to the start of any renewal term the agreements grant westcon group inc ingram micro inc tech data and arrow ecs the right to distribute our products to resellers with no minimum purchase requirements 

systems integrators we also market our products through strategic relationships with systems integrators including dell services hp enterprise services and ibm global services who include our products as core components of application deployments or networkbased solutions they deploy for their customers in most cases systems integrators do not directly purchase our products for resale to their customers instead they typically recommend our products as part of broader solutions such as enterprise resource planning erp or customer relationship management crm solutions that incorporate our products for high availability and enhanced performance 

resellers and technology partners  historically our ability to compete with much larger companies has been strengthened through partnerships with large systems and software vendors currently we partner with dell and hewlettpackard who resell our products and with other large technology companies including microsoft oracle vmware and cisco who recommend our products to their customers management of these relationships is the responsibility of our business development team which closely monitors technology companies in adjacent and complementary markets for opportunities to partner with those whose solutions are complementary to ours and could enable us to expand our addressable market 

marketing 

our marketing strategy is driven by the belief that our continued success depends on our ability to understand and anticipate the dynamic needs of our addressable markets and to develop valuable solutions that meet those needs in line with this belief our marketing organization works directly with customers partners and our product development teams to identify and create innovative solutions to further enhance our leadership position 

to support the growing number of developers using our products including network and application architects we continue to promote and expand devcentral f5s online community site that provides technical resources to customers prospects and partners wanting to extend and optimize their use of our solutions a key aspect of devcentral is an online forum where developers as well as application and network architects discuss and share solutions they have written with irules and icall at the end of fiscal year 2017  devcentral had more than 319000  registered members

hardware components for our products consist primarily of commodity parts and certain custom components designed and approved by our hardware engineering group most of our components are purchased from sources which we believe are readily available from other suppliers however some components used in the assembly of our products are purchased from a single or limited source 

testing of all subassemblies and assembled systems of our products are performed at flextronics facility in zhuhai china the majority of our systems are shipped to flextronics milpitas california plant for configuration final testing and eventual distribution to our end users we also have capabilities to complete this process for some of our products in flextronics zhuhai china plant for distribution to apac and japan end users 

competition 

the expanding capabilities of our product offerings have enabled us to address a growing array of market opportunities many of which are outside the bounds of the application delivery networking market as defined and measured by industry analysts such as gartner dell’oro and others in addition to server load balancing traffic management and other functions normally associated with application delivery our suite of integrated product modules has expanded our addressable market into security wan optimization application acceleration policy management and diameter signaling and routing where we compete with a growing number of companies not included among traditional adc vendors the ability to create customized programmable services using irules icontrol icall and similar technologies has also enabled us our customers and our partners to design solutions to problems for which there is no offtheshelf solution as a result we believe the traditional definitions of our market do not encompass all of the features functions and capabilities of our products or accurately represent the addressable market for those products 

within the more narrowly defined traditional adc market several companies sell server load balancing products and capabilities these include brocade communications systems inc citrix systems inc and a number of other competitors that have a smaller market presence or limited feature set such as a10 networks amazon web services microsoft array networks inc avi networks barracuda networks inc nginx ha proxy kemp technologies and radware ltd 

in related markets we compete with companies such as the following 

 the principal competitive factors in the markets in which we compete include product features and performance customer support brand recognition the scope of distribution and sales channels and pricing certain of our competitors have employed and may in the future adopt aggressive pricing policies to gain market share however because of the superior performance broad functionality and unique capabilities of our products which have resulted in high levels of customer satisfaction and growing brand awareness we believe that we can and will compete effectively against such pricing policies 

intellectual property 

we rely on a combination of patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights f5 holds 297  patents in the united states and has 22 international patents with applications pending for various aspects of our technology our future success depends in part on our ability to protect our proprietary rights to the technologies used in our principal products despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use trade secrets or other information that we regard as proprietary in addition the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights as fully as do the laws of the united states any issued patent may not preserve our proprietary position and competitors or others may develop technologies similar to or superior to our technology our failure to enforce and protect our intellectual property rights could harm our business operating results and financial condition 

in addition to our own proprietary software we incorporate software licensed from several thirdparty sources into our products these are generally term licenses which may renew annually and that generally provide for certain rights and licenses to support our customers post termination while we may not be able to renew certain of these licenses in the future we believe that alternative technologies for these licenses are available both domestically and internationally 

employees 

as of september 30 2017  we had 4366 fulltime employees including 1192  in product development 1711 in sales and marketing 895  in professional services and technical support and 471  in accounting and finance administration and operations none of our employees is represented by a labor union we have experienced no work stoppages and believe that our employee relations are good

 item 1a 

risk factors 

tableend in addition to the other information in this report the following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating our company and its business 

our business could be adversely impacted by conditions affecting the information technology market 

a substantial portion of our business depends on the demand for information technology by large enterprise customers and service providers in addition to the challenges presented by new cloud computing models we are dependent upon the overall economic health of our current and prospective customers and the continued growth and evolution of the internet international national regional and local economic conditions such as recessionary economic cycles protracted economic slowdown or further deterioration of the economy could adversely impact demand for our products demand for our products and services depends substantially upon the general demand for application delivery products and associated services which fluctuates based on numerous factors including capital spending levels and growth of our current and prospective customers as well as general economic conditions moreover the purchase of our products is often discretionary and may involve a significant commitment of capital and other resources future economic projections for the information technology sector are uncertain as companies continue to reassess their spending for technology projects and embrace new models for delivery of it services such as cloud computing and highly orchestrated software defined networking environments as a result spending priorities for our current and future customers may vary and demand for our products and services may be impacted in addition customer buying patterns are changing over time and more customers seek to rent software on a subscription basis and to reduce their total cost of ownership these evolving business models could lead to changes in demand and licensing strategies which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

cloudbased computing trends present competitive and execution risks 

customers are transitioning to a hybrid computing environment utilizing various cloudbased software and services accessed via various smart client devices pricing and delivery models are evolving and our competitors are developing and deploying cloudbased services for customers in addition new cloud infrastructures are enabling the emergence of new competitors including large cloud providers who offer their own adc functionality as well as smaller companies targeting the growing numbers of born in the cloud applications we are devoting significant resources to develop and deploy our own competing cloudbased software and services strategies while we believe our expertise and investments in software and infrastructure for cloudbased services provides us with a strong foundation to compete it is uncertain whether our strategies will attract the customers or generate the revenue required to be successful in addition to software development costs we are incurring costs to build and maintain infrastructure to support cloudcomputing services these costs may reduce the operating margins we have previously achieved whether we are successful in this new business model depends on our execution in a number of areas including 

 these new business models may reduce our revenues or operating margins and could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

industry consolidation may result in increased competition 

some of our competitors have made acquisitions or entered into partnerships or other strategic relationships to offer a more comprehensive solution than they had previously offered we have also entered into large strategic partnerships to enhance our competitive position in the marketplace as it companies attempt to strengthen or maintain their market positions in the evolving application delivery mobility cloud networking and cloud platform markets these companies continue to seek to deliver comprehensive it solutions to end users and combine enterpriselevel hardware and software solutions that may compete with our solutions and which could negatively impact our partnerships these consolidators or potential consolidators may have significantly greater financial technical and other resources than we do and may be better positioned to acquire and offer complementary products and services the companies resulting from these possible combinations may create more compelling product and service offerings and be able to offer greater pricing flexibility or sales and marketing support for such offerings than we can these heightened competitive pressures could result in a loss of customers or a reduction in our revenues or revenue growth rates all of which could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

we may not be able to compete effectively in the emerging application delivery networking market 

the markets we serve are new rapidly evolving and highly competitive and we expect competition to persist and intensify in the future our principal competitors in the application delivery networking market include brocade communications systems inc citrix systems inc and a number of other competitors that have a smaller market presence or limited feature set such as a10 networks amazon web services microsoft array networks inc avi networks barracuda networks inc nginx ha proxy kemp technologies and radware ltd 

in related markets we compete with companies such as the following 

 we expect to continue to face additional competition as new participants enter our markets as we continue to expand globally we may see new competitors in different geographic regions in addition larger companies with significant resources brand recognition and sales channels may form alliances with or acquire competing application delivery networking solutions from other companies and emerge as significant competitors potential competitors may bundle their products or incorporate an internet traffic management or security component into existing products in a manner that discourages users from purchasing our products any of these circumstances may limit our opportunities for growth and negatively impact our financial performance 

our success depends on our timely development of new products and features market acceptance of new product offerings and proper management of the timing of the life cycle of our products 

the markets for our products and services are characterized by 

 our continued success depends on our ability to identify and develop new products and new features for our existing products to meet the demands of these changes and the acceptance of those products and features by our existing and target 

customers in addition our products must interoperate with our end customers’ it infrastructure which often have different specifications deploy products from multiple vendors and utilize multiple protocol standards our customers’ it infrastructure is becoming more complex and we may be reliant on orchestration and interoperability with third party vendors on whom we are reliant for testing and support of new product versions and configurations if we are unable to identify develop and deploy new products and new product features on a timely basis our business and results of operations may be harmed 

the current development cycle for our products is on average 1224 months the introduction of new products or product enhancements may shorten the life cycle of our existing products or replace sales of some of our current products thereby offsetting the benefit of even a successful product introduction and may cause customers to defer purchasing our existing products in anticipation of the new products this could harm our operating results by decreasing sales increasing our inventory levels of older products and exposing us to greater risk of product obsolescence we have also experienced and may in the future experience delays in developing and releasing new products and product enhancements this has led to and may in the future lead to delayed sales increased expenses and lower quarterly revenue than anticipated also in the development of our products we have experienced delays in the prototyping of our products which in turn has led to delays in product introductions in addition complexity and difficulties in managing product transitions at the endoflife stage of a product can create excess inventory of components associated with the outgoing product that can lead to increased expenses any or all of the above problems could materially harm our business and results of operations 

our success depends on sales and continued innovation of our application delivery networking product lines 

for the fiscal year ended september 30 2017  we derived approximately 997  of our net product revenues or approximately 460  of our total net revenues from sales of our application delivery networking adn product lines we expect to continue to derive a significant portion of our net revenues from sales of our adn products in the future implementation of our strategy depends upon these products being able to solve critical network availability performance and security problems for our customers if our adn products are unable to solve these problems for our customers or if we are unable to sustain the high levels of innovation in our adn product feature set needed to maintain leadership in what will continue to be a competitive market environment our business and results of operations will be harmed 

undetected software or hardware errors or security vulnerabilities may harm our business and results of operations 

our products may contain undetected errors or defects when first introduced or as new versions are released we have experienced these errors or defects in the past in connection with new products and product upgrades as our products and customer it infrastructures become increasingly complex customers may experience unforeseen errors in implementing our products into their it environments we expect that these errors or defects will be found from time to time in new or enhanced products after commencement of commercial shipments these problems may cause us to incur significant warranty and repair costs divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts and cause significant customer relations problems we may also be subject to liability claims for damages related to product errors or defects while we carry insurance policies covering this type of liability these policies may not provide sufficient protection should a claim be asserted a material product liability claim may harm our business and results of operations 

our products must successfully operate with products from other vendors as a result when problems occur in a network it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem the occurrence of software or hardware problems whether caused by our products or another vendor’s products may result in the delay or loss of market acceptance of our products the occurrence of any of these problems may harm our business and results of operations 

our products are used to manage critical applications and data for customers and third parties may attempt to exploit security vulnerabilities in our products as well as our internal it systems as we continue to focus on the development and marketing of security solutions we become a bigger target for malicious computer hackers who wish to exploit security vulnerabilities in our products or it systems these problems may cause us to incur significant remediation costs divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts and cause significant customer relations problems adverse publicity related to security vulnerabilities or damage to a customer’s operations due to exploitation of security vulnerability in our products or it systems may harm our business and results of operations 

any errors defects or vulnerabilities in our products or it systems could result in 



 we are dependent on various information technology systems and failures of or interruptions to those systems could harm our business 

many of our business processes depend upon our it systems the systems and processes of third parties and on interfaces with the systems of third parties for example our order entry system provides information to the systems of our contract manufacturers which enables them to build and ship our products if those systems fail or are interrupted or if our ability to connect to or interact with one or more networks is interrupted our processes may function at a diminished level or not at all this would harm our ability to ship products and our financial results may be harmed 

in addition reconfiguring our it systems or other business processes in response to changing business needs may be timeconsuming and costly to the extent this impacted our ability to react timely to specific market or business opportunities our financial results may be harmed 

our failure to adequately protect personal information could have a material adverse effect on our business 

a wide variety of local state national and international laws directives and regulations apply to the collection use retention protection disclosure transfer and other processing of personal data these data protection and privacyrelated laws and regulations continue to evolve and may result in everincreasing regulatory and public scrutiny and escalating levels of enforcement and sanctions and increased costs of compliance certain safeharbor exemptions upon which the company relies for data transfers have been challenged and may no longer be available to us in the future our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or to protect such data could result in enforcement action against us including fines imprisonment of company officials and public censure claims for damages by endcustomers and other affected individuals damage to our reputation and loss of goodwill both in relation to existing endcustomers and prospective endcustomers any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations financial performance and business changing definitions of personal data and personal information within the european union the united states and elsewhere especially relating to classification of ip addresses machine identification location data and other information may limit or inhibit our ability to operate or expand our business including limiting strategic partnerships that may involve the sharing of data the evolving data protection regulatory environment may require significant management attention and financial resources to analyze and modify our it infrastructure to meet these changing requirements all of which could reduce our operating margins and impact our operating results and financial condition 

our success depends on our key personnel and our ability to hire retain and motivate qualified executives sales and marketing operations product development and professional services personnel 

our success depends in large part on our ability to attract engage retain and integrate qualified executives and other key employees throughout all areas of our business in order to attract and retain executives and other key employees in a competitive marketplace we must provide a competitive compensation package including cash and equitybased compensation if we do not obtain the stockholder approval needed to continue granting equity compensation in a competitive manner our ability to attract retain and motivate executives and key employees could be weakened failure to successfully hire executives and key employees or the loss of any executives and key employees could have a significant impact on our operations further changes in our management team may be disruptive to our business and any failure to successfully integrate key new hires or promoted employees could adversely affect our business and results of operations in addition we recently announced john mcadams retirement as ceo and the appointment of françois locohdonou as ceo effective april 3 2017 transitioning to a new chief executive could be disruptive to our business and could adversely affect our business and results of operations the complexity of our application delivery networking products and their integration into existing networks and ongoing support as well as the sophistication of our sales and marketing effort requires us to retain highly trained developers professional services customer support and sales personnel competition for qualified developers professional services customer support and sales personnel in our industry is intense especially in silicon valley and seattle where we have substantial operations and a need for highly skilled personnel because of the limited number of people available with the necessary technical skills and understanding of our products also to the extent we hire personnel from competitors we may be subject to allegations that they have been improperly solicited that they have divulged proprietary or other confidential information that they have violated noncompete obligations to their prior employers or that their former employers own their inventions or other work product our ability to hire and retain these personnel may be adversely affected 

by volatility or reductions in the price of our common stock or our ability to get approval from shareholders to offer additional common stock to our employees since these employees are generally granted restricted stock units the loss of services of any of our key personnel the inability to retain and attract qualified personnel in the future or delays in hiring qualified personnel may harm our business and results of operations 

the average selling price of our products may decrease and our costs may increase which may negatively impact revenues and profits 

it is possible that the average selling prices of our products will decrease in the future in response to competitive pricing pressures increased sales discounts new product introductions by us or our competitors as well as the shift to more software consumption based and “as a service based” models or other factors therefore in order to maintain our profits we must develop and introduce new products and product enhancements on a timely basis and continually reduce our product costs our failure to do so could cause our revenue and profits to decline which would harm our business and results of operations in addition we may experience substantial periodtoperiod fluctuations in future operating results due to the erosion of our average selling prices 

our business may be harmed if our contract manufacturers are not able to provide us with adequate supplies of our products or if a single source of hardware assembly is lost or impaired 

we outsource the manufacturing of our hardware platforms to third party contract manufacturers who assemble these hardware platforms to our specifications we have experienced minor delays in shipments from contract manufacturers in the past however if we experience major delays in the future or other problems such as inferior quality and insufficient quantity of product any one or a combination of these factors may harm our business and results of operations the inability of our contract manufacturers to provide us with adequate supplies of our products or the loss of one or more of our contract manufacturers may cause a delay in our ability to fulfill orders while we obtain a replacement manufacturer and may harm our business and results of operations in particular we currently subcontract manufacturing of our application delivery networking products to a single contract manufacturer with whom we do not have a longterm contract if our arrangement with this single source of hardware assembly was terminated or otherwise impaired and we were not able to engage another contract manufacturer in a timely manner our business financial condition and results of operation could be adversely affected 

if the demand for our products grows we will need to increase our raw material and component purchases contract manufacturing capacity and internal test and quality control functions any disruptions in product flow may limit our revenue may harm our competitive position and may result in additional costs or cancellation of orders by our customers 

our business could suffer if there are any interruptions or delays in the supply of hardware components from our thirdparty sources 

we currently purchase several hardware components used in the assembly of our products from a number of single or limited sources lead times for these components vary significantly the unavailability of suitable components any interruption or delay in the supply of any of these hardware components or the inability to procure a similar component from alternate sources at acceptable prices within a reasonable time may delay assembly and sales of our products and hence our revenues and may harm our business and results of operations 

it is difficult to predict our future operating results because we have an unpredictable sales cycle 

our products have a lengthy sales cycle and the timing of our revenue is difficult to predict historically our sales cycle has ranged from approximately two to three months and has tended to lengthen as our products become increasingly complex also as our distribution strategy is focused on a channel model utilizing valueadded resellers distributors and systems integrators the level of variability in the length of sales cycle across transactions has increased and made it more difficult to predict the timing of many of our sales transactions sales of our products require us to educate potential customers in their use and benefits sales of our products are subject to delays from the lengthy internal budgeting approval and competitive evaluation processes that large enterprises and governmental entities may require for example customers frequently begin by evaluating our products on a limited basis and devote time and resources to testing our products before they decide whether or not to purchase customers may also defer orders as a result of anticipated releases of new products or enhancements by our competitors or us as a result our products have an unpredictable sales cycle that contributes to the uncertainty of our future operating results 

we may not be able to sustain or develop new distribution relationships and a reduction or delay in sales to significant distribution partners could hurt our business 

we sell our products and services through multiple distribution channels in the united states and internationally including leading industry distributors valueadded resellers systems integrators service providers and other indirect channel partners we have a limited number of agreements with companies in these channels and we may not be able to increase our number of distribution relationships or maintain our existing relationships recruiting and retaining qualified channel partners and training them in our technologies requires significant time and resources these channel partners may also market sell and support products and services that are competitive with ours and may devote more resources to the marketing sales and support of such competitive products our indirect sales channel structure could subject us to lawsuits potential liability and reputational harm if for example any of our channel partners misrepresent the functionality of our products or services to customers or violate laws or our corporate policies if we are unable to establish or maintain our indirect sales channels our business and results of operations will be harmed in addition four worldwide distributors of our products accounted for 566  of our total net revenue for fiscal year 2017  four worldwide distributors of our products accounted for 570  of our total net revenue for fiscal year 2016  a substantial reduction or delay in sales of our products to these distribution partners if not replaced by sales to other indirect channel partners and distributors could harm our business operating results and financial condition 

a portion of our revenue is generated by sales to government entities which are subject to a number of challenges and risks 

sales to us and foreign federal state and local governmental agency endcustomers account for a significant portion of our revenues and we may in the future increase sales to government entities sales to government entities are subject to a number of risks selling to government entities can be highly competitive expensive and time consuming often requiring significant upfront time and expense without any assurance that these efforts will generate a sale the substantial majority of our sales to date to government entities have been made indirectly through our channel partners government certification requirements for products like ours may change thereby restricting our ability to sell into the federal government sector until we have attained the revised certification government demand and payment for our products and services may be impacted by public sector budgetary cycles and funding authorizations with funding reductions or delays adversely affecting public sector demand for our products and services government entities may have statutory contractual or other legal rights to terminate contracts with our distributors and resellers for convenience or due to a default and any such termination may adversely impact our future operating results governments routinely investigate and audit government contractors’ administrative processes and any unfavorable audit could result in the government refusing to continue buying our products and services a reduction of revenue or fines or civil or criminal liability if the audit uncovers improper or illegal activities which could adversely impact our operating results in a material way finally for purchases by the us government the government may require certain products to be manufactured in the united states and other relatively high cost manufacturing locations and we may not manufacture all products in locations that meet the requirements of the us government affecting our ability to sell these products to the us government 

misuse of our products could harm our reputation 

our products may be misused by endcustomers or third parties that obtain access to our products for example our products could be used to censor private access to certain information on the internet such use of our products for censorship could result in negative publicity and damage to our reputation in addition as many of our products are subject to export control regulations diversion of our products to restricted third parties by others could result in investigations penalties fines trade restrictions and negative publicity that could damage our reputation and materially impact our business operating results and financial condition 

our quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate in future periods which may cause our stock price to fluctuate 

our quarterly and annual operating results have varied significantly in the past and could vary significantly in the future which makes it difficult for us to predict our future operating results our operating results may fluctuate due to a variety of factors many of which are outside of our control including the changing and recently volatile us and global economic environment which may cause our stock price to fluctuate in particular we anticipate that the size of customer orders may increase as we continue to focus on larger business accounts a delay in the recognition of revenue even from just one account may have a significant negative impact on our results of operations for a given period in the past a majority of our sales have been realized near the end of a quarter accordingly a delay in an anticipated sale past the end of a particular quarter may negatively impact our results of operations for that quarter or in some cases that fiscal year additionally we have exposure to the credit risks of some of our customers and subtenants although we have programs in place that are designed to monitor and mitigate the associated risk there can be no assurance that such programs will be effective in reducing our credit risks 

adequately we monitor individual payment capability in granting credit arrangements seek to limit the total credit to amounts we believe our customers can pay and maintain reserves we believe are adequate to cover exposure for potential losses if there is a deterioration of a subtenant’s or a major customer’s creditworthiness or actual defaults are higher than expected future losses if incurred could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our operating results further our operating results may be below the expectations of securities analysts and investors in future quarters or years our failure to meet these expectations will likely harm the market price of our common stock such a decline could occur and has occurred in the past even when we have met our publicly stated revenue andor earnings guidance 

reliance on shipments at the end of the quarter could cause our revenue for the applicable period to fall below expected levels 

as a result of customer buying patterns and the efforts of our sales force and channel partners to meet or exceed their sales objectives we have historically received a substantial portion of sales orders and generated a substantial portion of revenue during the last few weeks of each fiscal quarter in addition any significant interruption in our information technology systems which manage critical functions such as order processing revenue recognition financial forecasts inventory and supply chain management and trade compliance reviews could result in delayed order fulfillment and decreased revenue for that fiscal quarter if expected revenue at the end of any fiscal quarter is delayed for any reason including the failure of anticipated purchase orders to materialize our third party contract manufacturers’ inability to manufacture and ship products prior to fiscal quarterend to fulfill purchase orders received near the end of the fiscal quarter our failure to manage inventory to meet demand our inability to release new products on schedule any failure of our systems related to order review and processing or any delays in shipments based on trade compliance requirements our revenue for that quarter could fall below our expectations resulting in a decline in the trading price of our common stock 

changes in financial accounting standards may cause adverse unexpected revenue fluctuations and affect our reported results of operations 

a change in accounting policies can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective new pronouncements and varying interpretations of existing pronouncements have occurred with frequency and may occur in the future changes to existing rules or changes to the interpretations of existing rules could lead to changes in our accounting practices and such changes could adversely affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business 

if we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting the accuracy and timeliness of our financial reporting may be adversely affected 

as a public company we are required to design and maintain proper and effective internal controls over financial reporting and to report any material weaknesses in such internal controls section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 requires that we evaluate and determine the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting and provide a management report on the internal controls over financial reporting which must be attested to by our independent registered public accounting firm we have an ongoing program to review the design of our internal controls framework in keeping with changes in business needs implement necessary changes to our controls design and test the system and process controls necessary to comply with these requirements if in the future our internal controls over financial reporting are determined to be not effective resulting in a material weakness investor perceptions regarding the reliability of our financial statements may be adversely affected which could cause a decline in the market price of our stock and otherwise negatively affect our liquidity and financial condition 

we may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities 

our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely affected by nondeductible stockbased compensation changes in the research and development tax credit laws earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and being higher than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates transfer pricing adjustments not meeting the terms and conditions of tax holidays or incentives changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in actual results versus our estimates or changes in tax laws regulations accounting principles or interpretations thereof including changes to the tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals the us the european union and its member states and a number of other countries are actively pursuing changes in this regard in addition like other companies we may be subject to examination of our income tax returns by the us internal revenue service and other tax authorities while we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes from such examinations and the adequacy of our provision for income taxes there can be no assurance that such provision is sufficient and that a determination by a tax authority will not have an adverse effect on our results of operations we do not provide for us income taxes on certain foreign subsidiaries in which we intend to indefinitely reinvest such earnings outside the us if our intent changes or if 

these funds are needed for us operations we would be required to accrue or pay us taxes on some or all of these undistributed earnings and our effective tax rate would be adversely affected additionally any changes in us tax laws that would limit the ability to defer taxation on earnings outside of the us could affect the tax treatment of our foreign earnings 

we are subject to governmental export and import controls that could subject us to liability or impair our ability to compete in international markets 

our products are subject to us export controls and may be exported outside the us only with the required level of export license or through an export license exception because we incorporate encryption technology into our products in addition various countries regulate the import of certain encryption technology and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute our products or our customers’ ability to implement our products in those countries changes in our products or changes in export and import regulations may create delays in the introduction of our products in international markets prevent our customers with international operations from deploying our products throughout their global systems or in some cases prevent the export or import of our products to certain countries altogether any change in export or import regulations or related legislation shift in approach to the enforcement or scope of existing regulations or change in the countries persons or technologies targeted by such regulations could result in decreased use of our products by or in our decreased ability to export or sell our products to existing or potential customers with international operations any decreased use of our products or limitation on our ability to export or sell our products would likely adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property and our products may infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties 

we rely on a combination of patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure of confidential and proprietary information to protect our intellectual property rights despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology monitoring unauthorized use of our products is difficult and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of our technology particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 

our industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the ordinary course of our business we are involved in disputes and licensing discussions with others regarding their claimed proprietary rights and cannot provide assurance that we will always successfully defend ourselves against such claims and such matters are subject to many uncertainties and outcomes are not predictable with assurance we expect that infringement claims may increase as the number of products and competitors in our market increases and overlaps occur also as we have gained greater visibility market exposure and competitive success we face a higher risk of being the subject of intellectual property infringement claims if we are found to infringe the proprietary rights of others or if we otherwise settle such claims we could be compelled to pay damages or royalties and either obtain a license to those intellectual property rights or alter our products so that they no longer infringe upon such proprietary rights any license could be very expensive to obtain or may not be available at all or may require us to make royalty payments which could adversely affect gross margins in future periods the actual liability in any such matters may be materially different from our estimate if any which could result in the need to adjust the liability and record additional expenses similarly changing our products or processes to avoid infringing upon the rights of others may be costly or impractical in addition we have initiated and may in the future initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to determine the scope and validity of our proprietary rights or those of our competitors any of these claims whether claims that we are infringing the proprietary rights of others or vice versa with or without merit may be timeconsuming result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel or require us to cease using infringing technology develop noninfringing technology or enter into royalty or licensing agreements further our license agreements typically require us to indemnify our customers distributors and resellers for infringement actions related to our technology which could cause us to become involved in infringement claims made against our customers distributors or resellers any of the abovedescribed circumstances relating to intellectual property rights disputes could result in our business and results of operations being harmed 

we incorporate open source software into our products although we monitor our use of open source closely the terms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by us courts and there is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products we could also be subject to similar conditions or restrictions should there be any changes in the licensing terms of the open source software incorporated into our products in either event we could be required to seek licenses from third parties in order to continue offering our products to reengineer our products or to discontinue the sale of our products in the event reengineering cannot 

be accomplished on a timely or successful basis any of which could adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

many of our products include intellectual property licensed from third parties in the future it may be necessary to renew licenses for third party intellectual property or obtain new licenses for other technology these third party licenses may not be available to us on acceptable terms if at all the inability to obtain certain licenses or litigation regarding the interpretation or enforcement of license rights and related intellectual property issues could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition furthermore we license some third party intellectual property on a nonexclusive basis and this may limit our ability to protect our intellectual property rights in our products 

our operating results are exposed to risks associated with international commerce 

as our international sales increase our operating results become more exposed to international operating risks additionally our international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks including the following 

 in addition in june 2016 voters in the united kingdom approved an advisory referendum to withdraw from the european union commonly referred to as brexit subsequently in march 2017 the united kingdoms government invoked article 50 of the treaty on european union which formally triggered the twoyear negotiation process to exit the european union the uncertainty surrounding the terms of the united kingdoms withdrawal and its consequences may cause our customers to closely monitor their costs and reduce their spending on our products and services 

we must hire and train experienced personnel to staff and manage our foreign operations to the extent that we experience difficulties in recruiting training managing and retaining an international staff and specifically staff related to sales management and sales personnel we may experience difficulties in sales productivity in foreign markets we also enter into strategic distributor and reseller relationships with companies in certain international markets where we do not have a local presence if we are not able to maintain successful strategic distributor relationships internationally or recruit additional companies to enter into strategic distributor relationships our future success in these international markets could be limited business practices in the international markets that we serve may differ from those in the united states and may require us in the future to include terms other than our standard terms in customer contracts we intend to continue expanding into international markets sales outside of the americas represented 433  and 436  of our net revenues for the fiscal years ended september 30 2017  and 2016  respectively 

these factors and other factors could harm our ability to gain future international revenues and consequently materially impact our business operating results and financial condition the expansion of our existing international operations and entry into additional international markets will require significant management attention and financial resources our failure to successfully manage our international operations and the associated risks effectively could limit the future growth of our business 

changes in governmental regulations could negatively affect our revenues 

many of our products are subject to various regulations promulgated by the united states and various foreign governments including but not limited to environmental regulations and regulations implementing export license requirements and restrictions on the import or export of some technologies especially encryption technology changes in governmental regulation and our inability or failure to obtain required approvals permits or registrations could harm our international and domestic sales and adversely affect our revenues business and operations 

new regulations related to conflict minerals may force us to incur additional expenses and could limit the supply and increase the costs of certain metals and minerals used in the manufacturing of our products 

in august 2012 the sec adopted new requirements under the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 or the doddfrank act for companies that use certain minerals and derivative metals referred to as conflict minerals regardless of their country of origin in their products whether or not these products are manufactured by third parties the doddfrank act requires companies to perform due diligence and disclose whether or not such minerals originate from the democratic republic of congo or adjoining countries we filed a report on form sd with the sec regarding such matters on may 31 2017 these requirements could adversely affect the sourcing availability and pricing of minerals or metals used in the manufacture of our products and the numerous components that go into our products all of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results in addition we will incur additional costs to comply with the disclosure requirements including costs related to determining the source of any relevant minerals and metals used in our products we have a complex supply chain and many components are sourced through our contract manufacturer and we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins for these minerals and metals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement as a result we may face reputational challenges with our customers and other stakeholders and possible regulatory risk 

we face litigation risks 

we are a party to lawsuits in the normal course of our business litigation in general and intellectual property and securities litigation in particular can be expensive lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations moreover the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict responding to lawsuits has been and will likely continue to be expensive and timeconsuming for us an unfavorable resolution of these lawsuits could adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

acquisitions present many risks and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that are contemplated at the time of the transaction 

with respect to our past acquisitions as well as any other future acquisitions we may undertake we may find that the acquired businesses products or technologies do not further our business strategy as expected that we paid more than what the assets are later worth or that economic conditions change all of which may generate future impairment charges our acquisitions may be viewed negatively by customers financial markets or investors there may be difficulty integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired business and we may have difficulty retaining the key personnel of the acquired business we may have difficulty in integrating the acquired technologies or products with our existing product lines our ongoing business and management’s attention may be disrupted or diverted by transition or integration issues and the complexity of managing geographically and culturally diverse locations we may have difficulty maintaining uniform standards controls procedures and policies across locations we may experience significant problems or liabilities associated with product quality technology and other matters 

our inability to successfully operate and integrate newlyacquired businesses appropriately effectively and in a timely manner or to retain key personnel of any acquired business could have a material adverse effect on our ability to take advantage of further growth in demand for integrated traffic management and security solutions and other advances in technology as well as on our revenues gross margins and expenses 

antitakeover provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us 

our board of directors has the authority to issue up to 10000000 shares of preferred stock and to determine the price rights preferences privileges and restrictions including voting rights of those shares without any further vote or action by the shareholders the rights of the holders of common stock may be subject to and may be adversely affected by the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future the issuance of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a change of control of our company without further action by our shareholders and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of the holders of common stock further certain provisions of our bylaws including a provision limiting the ability of shareholders to raise matters at a meeting of shareholders without giving advance notice may have the 

effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or management of our company which could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock similarly state antitakeover laws in the state of washington related to corporate takeovers may prevent or delay a change of control of our company 

our stock price could be volatile particularly during times of economic uncertainty and volatility in domestic and international stock markets 

our stock price has been volatile and has fluctuated significantly in the past the trading price of our stock is likely to continue to be volatile and subject to fluctuations in the future some of the factors that could significantly affect the market price of our stock include 

 the stock market in general and the market for technology companies in particular have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations these fluctuations have often been unrelated or disproportionate to operating performance the fluctuations may continue in the future and this could significantly impact the value of our stock and your investment 

if securities or industry analysts publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business or discontinue publishing research about our business the price and trading volume of our securities could decline 

the trading market for our common stock is influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us our business our market or our competitors if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our common stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business the price of our securities would likely decline if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly demand for our securities could decrease which might cause the price and trading volume of our securities to decline 

we face risks associated with having operations and employees located in israel 

we have offices and employees located in israel as a result political economic and military conditions in israel directly affect our operations the future of peace efforts between israel and its arab neighbors remains uncertain there has been a significant increase in hostilities and political unrest in israel in the past year the effects of these hostilities and violence on the israeli economy and our operations in israel are unclear and we cannot predict the effect on us of further increases in these hostilities or future armed conflict political instability or violence in the region in addition many of our employees in israel are obligated to perform annual reserve duty in the israeli military and are subject to being called for active duty under emergency circumstances we cannot predict the full impact of these conditions on us in the future particularly if emergency circumstances or an escalation in the political situation occurs if many of our employees in israel are called for active duty for a significant period of time our operations and our business could be disrupted and may not be able to function at full capacity current or future tensions and conflicts in the middle east could adversely affect our business operating results financial condition and cash flows 

our business is subject to the risks of earthquakes fire power outages floods and other catastrophic events and to interruption by manmade problems such as terrorism 

a significant natural disaster such as an earthquake a fire a flood or a significant power outage could have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition we have an administrative and product development office and a third party contract manufacturer located in the san francisco bay area a region known for seismic activity in addition natural disasters could affect our supply chain manufacturing vendors or logistics providers’ ability to provide materials and perform services such as manufacturing products or assisting with shipments on a timely basis in the event our or our service providers’ information technology systems or manufacturing or logistics abilities are hindered by any of the events discussed above shipments could be delayed resulting in missed financial targets such as revenue and shipment targets for a particular quarter in addition cyberattacks acts of terrorism or other geopolitical unrest could cause disruptions in our business or the business of our supply chain manufacturers logistics providers partners or endcustomers or the economy as a whole any disruption in the business of our supply chain manufacturers logistics providers partners or endcustomers that impacts sales at the end of a fiscal quarter could have a significant adverse impact on our quarterly results all of the aforementioned risks may be further increased if the disaster recovery plans for us and our suppliers prove to be inadequate to 

the extent that any of the above should result in delays or cancellations of customer orders or the delay in the manufacture deployment or shipment of our products our business financial condition and operating results would be adversely affected 

in addition to other risks listed in this “risk factors” section factors that may affect our operating results include but are not limited to

our management team monitors and analyzes a number of key performance indicators in order to manage our business and evaluate our financial and operating performance on a consolidated basis those indicators include 





critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements 

revenue recognition we sell products through distributors resellers and directly to end users revenue is recognized provided that all of the following criteria have been met 

 revenue from the sale of products is generally recognized when the product has been shipped and the customer is obligated to pay for the product when rights of return are present and we cannot estimate returns revenue is recognized when such rights of return lapse payment terms to domestic customers are generally net 30 days to net 45 days payment terms to international customers range from net 30 days to net 120 days based on normal and customary trade practices in the individual markets 

revenues for postcontract customer support pcs are recognized on a straightline basis over the service contract term pcs includes a limited period of telephone support updates repair or replacement of any failed product or component that fails during the term of the agreement bug fixes and rights to upgrades when and if available consulting services are customarily billed at fixed hourly rates plus outofpocket expenses and revenues are recognized when the consulting has been completed training revenue is recognized when the training has been completed 

arrangement consideration is first allocated between software consisting of nonessential and standalone software and nonsoftware deliverables the majority of our products are hardware appliances which contain software essential to the overall functionality of the products hardware appliances are generally sold with pcs and on occasion with consulting andor training services arrangement consideration in such multiple element transactions is allocated to each element based on a fair value hierarchy where the selling price for an element is based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe if available thirdparty evidence tpe if available and vsoe is not available or the best estimate of selling price besp if neither vsoe or tpe is available 

for software deliverables we allocate revenue between multiple elements based on software revenue recognition guidance software revenue recognition guidance requires revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements to be allocated to each element based on the relative fair values of those elements the fair value of an element must be based on vsoe where fair value of delivered elements is not available revenue is recognized on the “residual method” based on the fair value of undelivered elements if evidence of fair value of one or more undelivered elements does not exist all revenue is deferred and recognized at the earlier of the delivery of those elements or the establishment of fair value of the remaining undelivered elements 

we establish vsoe for our products pcs consulting and training services based on the sales price charged for each element when sold separately the sales price is discounted from the applicable list price based on various factors including the type of customer volume of sales geographic region and program level our list prices are generally not fair value as discounts 

may be given based on the factors enumerated above we use historical sales transactions to determine whether vsoe can be established for each of the elements in most instances vsoe of fair value is the sales price of actual standalone unbundled transactions within the past 12 month period when a substantial majority of transactions more than 80 are priced within a narrow range which we have determined to be plus or minus 15 of the median sales price 

we believe that the vsoe of fair value of training and consulting services is represented by the billable rate per hour based on the rates charged to customers when they purchase standalone training or consulting services the price of consulting services is not based on the type of customer volume of sales geographic region or program level 

we are typically not able to determine vsoe or tpe for nonsoftware products tpe is determined based on competitor prices for similar elements when sold separately generally our gotomarket strategy differs from that of other competitive products or services in its markets and our offerings contain a significant level of differentiation such that the comparable pricing of products with similar functionality cannot be obtained furthermore we are unable to reliably determine the selling prices on a standalone basis of similar products offered by our competitors 

when we are unable to establish selling price using vsoe or tpe we use besp in our allocation of arrangement consideration the objective of besp is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a standalone basis we have been able to establish besp through the list price less a discount deemed appropriate to maintain a reasonable gross margin management regularly reviews gross margin information at the consolidated level nonsoftware product besp is determined through our review of historical sales transactions within the past 12 month period additional factors considered in determining an appropriate besp include but are not limited to cost of products pricing practices geographies customer classes and distribution channels 

we regularly validate the vsoe of fair value and besp for elements in its multiple element arrangements we account for taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities on a net basis and excluded these amounts from revenues 

reserve for doubtful accounts estimates are used in determining our allowance for doubtful accounts and are based upon an assessment of selected accounts and as a percentage of our remaining accounts receivable by aging category in determining these percentages we evaluate historical writeoffs current trends in the credit quality of our customer base as well as changes in the credit policies we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition and do not require any collateral if there is deterioration of a major customer’s credit worthiness or actual defaults are higher than our historical experience our allowance for doubtful accounts may not be sufficient 

reserve for product returns in some instances product revenue from distributors is subject to agreements allowing rights of return product returns are estimated based on historical experience and are recorded at the time revenues are recognized accordingly we reduce recognized revenue for estimated future returns at the time revenue is recorded when rights of return are present and we cannot estimate returns revenue is recognized when such rights lapse the estimates for returns are adjusted periodically based upon changes in historical rates of returns and other related factors it is possible that these estimates will change in the future or that the actual amounts could vary from our estimates 

accounting for income taxes we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure including assessing the risks associated with tax audits together with assessing temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities due to the evolving nature and complexity of tax rules combined with the large number of jurisdictions in which we operate it is possible that our estimates of our tax liability could change in the future which may result in additional tax liabilities and adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

stockbased compensation we account for stockbased compensation using the straightline attribution method for recognizing compensation expense over the requisite service period of the related award we recognized 1753 million  and 1568 million  of stockbased compensation expense for the years ended september 30 2017  and 2016  respectively as of september 30 2017  there was 1261 million  of total unrecognized stockbased compensation cost the majority of which will be recognized over the next two  years going forward stockbased compensation expenses may increase as we issue additional equitybased awards to continue to attract and retain key employees 

we issue incentive awards to our employees through stockbased compensation consisting of restricted stock units rsus the value of rsus is determined using the fair value method which in this case is based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock on the date of grant in determining the fair value of shares issued under the employee stock purchase plan espp we use the blackscholes option pricing model we recognize compensation expense related to shares issued pursuant to the espp on a straightline basis over the offering period 

we recognize compensation expense for only the portion of rsus that are expected to vest therefore we apply estimated forfeiture rates that are derived from historical employee termination behavior based on historical differences with forfeitures of stockbased awards granted to our executive officers and board of directors versus grants awarded to all other employees we developed separate forfeiture expectations for these two groups 

we recognize compensation costs for awards with performance conditions when we conclude it is probable that the performance condition will be achieved we reassess the probability of vesting at each balance sheet date and adjust compensation costs based on our probability assessment 

common stock repurchase on april 20 2016  we announced that our board of directors authorized an additional 10 billion  for our common stock share repurchase program this new authorization is incremental to the existing 24 billion  program initially approved in october 2010 and expanded in each fiscal year acquisitions for the share repurchase programs will be made from time to time in private transactions or open market purchases as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements the programs can be terminated at any time during fiscal year 2017 we repurchased and retired 4561213  shares at an average price of 13156  per share and as of september 30 2017 we had 1737 million  remaining authorized to purchase shares 

goodwill and acquired intangible assets goodwill represents the excess purchase price over the estimated fair value of net assets acquired as of the acquisition date we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests when impairment indicators are identified goodwill is written down when impaired goodwill was recorded in connection with various acquisitions in fiscal year 2014 and prior years for our annual goodwill impairment test in all periods to date we have operated under one reporting unit and the fair value of the reporting unit has been determined by the company’s enterprise value we perform our annual goodwill impairment test during the second fiscal quarter 

as part of the annual goodwill impairment test we have the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary if as a result of its qualitative assessment it is morelikelythannot ie greater than 50 chance that the fair value of our reporting unit is less than its carrying amount the quantitative impairment test will be required otherwise no further testing will be required if we choose to bypass the qualitative assessment we complete a quantitative assessment in performing our annual impairment test 

examples of events and circumstances that might indicate that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount include macroeconomic conditions such as deterioration in the entity’s operating environment or industry or market considerations entityspecific events such as increasing costs declining financial performance or loss of key personnel or other events such as an expectation that a reporting unit will be sold or a sustained decrease in the stock price on either an absolute basis or relative to peers 

if it is determined as a result of the qualitative assessment that it is morelikelythannot that the fair value of our reporting unit is less than its carrying amount the provisions of authoritative guidance require that we perform a twostep impairment test on goodwill the first step of the test identifies whether potential impairment may have occurred while the second step of the test measures the amount of the impairment if any impairment is recognized when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its fair value during the year we performed our goodwill impairment assessment and concluded that it was morelikelythannot that the fair value of our reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount we considered potential impairment indicators of goodwill and acquired intangible assets at september 30 2017 and noted no indicators of impairment 

software development costs the authoritative guidance requires certain internal software development costs related to software to be sold to be capitalized upon the establishment of technological feasibility our software development costs incurred subsequent to achieving technological feasibility have not been significant and all software development costs have been expensed as research and development activities as incurred 

internal use software  in accordance with the authoritative guidance we capitalize application development stage costs associated with the development of new functionality for internaluse software and software developed related to our saasbased product offerings the capitalized costs are then amortized over the estimated useful life of the software which is generally three to five years and are included in property and equipment in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 

investments our investments are diversified among highcredit quality debt securities in accordance with our investment policy we classify our investments as availableforsale which are reported at fair market value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss in stockholders’ equity realized gains and losses and declines in value of these investments judged to be other than temporary are included in other income expense to date we have not deemed it necessary to record any charges related to otherthantemporary declines in the estimated fair values of our marketable debt securities however the fair value of our investments is subject to volatility declines in the fair value of our investments judged to be other than temporary could adversely affect our future operating results 

results of operations 

the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

  



net revenues total net revenues increased 48  in fiscal year 2017  from fiscal year 2016  compared to an increase of 39  in fiscal year 2016  from the prior year overall revenue growth for the year ended september 30 2017  was primarily due to increased demand for our core adn products and increased service revenues as a result of our increased installed base of products international revenues represented 486  489  and 477  of net revenues in fiscal years 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively we expect international sales will continue to represent a significant portion of net revenues although we cannot provide assurance that international revenues as a percentage of net revenues will remain at current levels 

net product revenues increased 21  in fiscal year 2017  from fiscal year 2016  compared to a decrease of 47  in fiscal year 2016  from the prior year the increase  of 202 million  in net product sales for fiscal year 2017  was due to an increase of 277 million  in sales of our adn products in particular growth in sales of our security solutions and softwareonly virtual editions contributed to the increase in product revenue for fiscal year 2017 the decrease of 471 million  in net product sales for fiscal year 2016  was primarily due to a 475 million  decrease in the volume of sales of our adn products 

net service revenues increased   71  in fiscal year 2017  from fiscal year 2016  compared to an increase of 132  in fiscal year 2016  from the prior year the increases in service revenue were the result of increased purchases or renewals of maintenance contracts driven by additions to our installed base of products 

the following distributors of our products accounted for more than 10 of total net revenue 





the following distributors of our products accounted for more than 10 of total receivables

potential exposures may be greater or less than the liabilities recorded which could result in an adjustment to our future tax expense 

liquidity and capital resources 

we have funded our operations with our cash balances cash generated from operations and proceeds from public offerings of our securities

cash provided by operating activities during fiscal year 2017  was 7403 million  compared to 7115 million  in fiscal year 2016  and 6845 million  in fiscal year 2015  cash provided by operating activities resulted primarily from cash generated from net income after adjusting for noncash charges such as stockbased compensation depreciation and amortization charges and changes in operating assets and liabilities 

cash used in investing activities during fiscal year 2017  was 323 million  compared to cash provided by investing activities of 627 million  in fiscal year 2016  and cash used in investing activities of 107 million  in fiscal year 2015  cash used in investing activities for fiscal year 2017  was primarily the result of the purchase of investments and capital expenditures related to maintaining our operations worldwide partially offset by the sale and maturity of investments cash provided by investing activities for fiscal year 2016  was primarily the result of the sale and maturity of investments partially offset by the purchase of investments and capital expenditures related to maintaining our operations worldwide cash used in investing activities for fiscal year 2015  was primarily the result of the purchase of investments and capital expenditures related to the expansion of our facilities to support our operations worldwide partially offset by the sale and maturity of investments

based on our current operating and capital expenditure forecasts we believe that our existing cash and investment balances together with cash generated from operations should be sufficient to meet our operating requirements for the next 

twelve months our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our rate of revenue growth the expansion of our sales and marketing activities the timing and extent of expansion into new territories the timing of introductions of new products and enhancements of existing products and the continuing market acceptance of our products

foreign currency risk the majority of our sales and expenses are denominated in us dollars and as a result we have not experienced significant foreign currency transaction gains and losses to date while we have conducted some transactions in foreign currencies during the fiscal year ended september 30 2017  and expect to continue to do so we do not anticipate that foreign currency transaction gains or losses will be significant at our current level of operations however as we continue to expand our operations internationally transaction gains or losses may become significant in the future we have not engaged in foreign currency hedging to date however we may do so in the future

internet protocol ip is a communications language used to deliver applications and data over the internet for more than two decades large business and government organizations have been gradually replacing older data center architectures with ipbased infrastructures deploying new ipbased applications and replacing or upgrading legacy applications with new ipenabled versions this trend has been accompanied by the proliferation of mobile devices such as smartphones tablets and laptops that allow users to access data and applications from almost anywhere at the same time virtualization of data centers and networks and the emergence of public clouds have given rise to dynamic hybrid infrastructures where applications are increasingly hosted offpremise as well as in traditional data centers and can move freely between locations as demand or other circumstances require 

emergence of the dynamic data center and hybrid it infrastructures 

from a broad perspective the goal of it organizations is to optimize the secure delivery of applications to users wherever they are and whenever they need them regardless of where those applications exist server virtualization has enabled organizations to group or partition data center resources to meet user demand and reconfigure these virtual resources easily and quickly as demand changes more recently software defined networks sdn offer organizations ways to reduce costs increase the flexibility and simplify the deployment and management of it infrastructure through network virtualization many organizations are also taking advantage of the growing availability of external private and public cloud resources as a flexible secure and reliable alternative to owning and managing everything themselves as a result it infrastructure has become increasingly dynamic complex and reliant on ipbased networks for the delivery of applications and data 

at the same time these changes have created new challenges to the security of ip networks and the applications and data accessible over the internet with increasing frequency sophisticated denialofservice attacks have exposed a major vulnerability in the security perimeter of corporate networks by overwhelming firewalls and effectively shutting down the networks in addition many networklevel security threats are directly related to the improper use of the same protocols applications depend on to transmit data intrusion detection and prevention devices which rely on signature databases of known threats afford some protection against these types of attack however they offer no protection against many of the most common threats including information leakage content spoofing crosssite request forgery or “day zero” attacks designed to exploit a variety of application vulnerabilities 

in addition to preventing the threat of attacks designed to disrupt destroy or block access to network applications organizations are faced with the equally daunting challenge of controlling access to applications and data the proliferation of mobile devices has given users with smart phones tablets and laptops the ability to access corporate private and public data centers from virtually anywhere this in turn has increased the difficulty of ensuring that mobile users are able to access applications and data for which they are authorized and that applications and data are protected from access by unauthorized users 

need to optimize the secure delivery of applications and data 

with the ongoing evolution and increasing complexity of it infrastructures there is a growing need to optimize the secure delivery of applications and data over ip networks ipbased traffic passing between enduser devices and servers is divided into discrete packets that travel by multiple routes to their destination where they are reassembled the disassembly routing and reassembly of transmissions are relatively straightforward and require little intelligence by contrast managing inspecting modifying redirecting and securing application traffic going to and from servers requires intelligent systems capable of performing an expanding array of functions broadly speaking all of those functions are aspects of application delivery 

application delivery services dynamically manage secure and optimize the flow of traffic between users and servers physical or virtual freeing up other resources by offloading common network functions such as encryption ipv4ipv6 translation compression authentication rateshaping and a variety of specialized functions including network and application security services policy management and wan optimization that would otherwise have to be coded into applications since most large enterprises have hundreds — if not thousands — of applications it isnt practical to replicate these functions within each instance of an application and maintain consistent policies across a broad spectrum of different applications in traditional data centers it has been common practice to deploy an array of point products in front of server farms to provide various services but that typically requires integrating maintaining and upgrading disparate technologies from different vendors a process that is timeconsuming and expensive in terms of both capital and operating costs from a security standpoint it is also much more difficult to audit traffic passing through multiple devices in such environments a more practical and efficient solution is a comprehensive set of integrated application delivery services on a single highperformance device in virtual and 

cloud environments where flexibility is a priority software designed to run on standard hypervisors provides the same services and many of the benefits associated with hardwarebased solutions 

although application delivery services are broadly applicable within enterprise and service provider it infrastructures service providers face unique challenges as they attempt to modernize and scale their networks to deal with the flood of data generated by smart phones tablets wearables and other mobile devices to cope with these challenges service providers are migrating legacy 2g3g infrastructures to 4glte networks and evolved packet core epc data centers that require an array of network and application services today most of those services are deployed on separate appliances from different vendors and service providers are actively seeking solutions that will enable them to lower costs and improve reliability and performance by consolidating services and reducing the number of devices increasingly they are also demanding software solutions designed to run on commodity hardware that can be repurposed as needed to cope with the dramatic increase in signaling traffic associated with 4glte networks the challenges of migrating legacy infrastructure and the need to integrate charging and enforcement functions with subscriber data service providers have also adopted the diameter signaling protocol as the de facto standard for communication within their evolving data centers 

f5’s strategy 

our goal is to lead the industry in providing ip network services that ensure the safe fast and reliable delivery of applications to any user anywhere anytime regardless of a users location or where the application resides these services include availability security performance mobility and identity they also include managing and orchestrating resources as well as coordinating services across multiple data centers networks and cloudbased resources our products are designed to be strategic points of control in the it infrastructure that allow business policies to be implemented where information is exchanged key components of our strategy include 

offering a complete integrated suite of application services 

since the introduction of tmos we have developed tmosbased versions of our own legacy products such as local traffic manager ltm bigip dns and link controller new products such as advanced firewall manager afm carrier grade network address translation cgnat and policy enforcement manager pem and products that incorporate acquired technology including application security manager asm application acceleration manager aam access policy manager apm and our enduser protection services websafe and mobilesafe all of these products are currently available as integrated software modules on our bigip and viprion hardware and as virtual editions that run on any standard hypervisor recently we introduced our first standalone security appliances ddos hybrid defender and ssl orchestrator in addition we offer online ddos protection and application security as subscription services on our cloudbased silverline saas platform regardless whether these services are deployed as softwareonly solutions or as modules running on our purposebuilt hardware our bigiq management platform allows customers to apply and update consistent policies across all of their f5 services from a centralized resource we believe this approach addresses the needs of todays evolving hybrid infrastructures and sharply differentiates our products from our competitors’ offerings 

investing in technology to meet evolving customer needs 

we meet with our customers often and we host an annual invitational customer advisory board to ensure that our development efforts are aligned with their needs we continue to invest in research and development efforts that leverage the unique attributes of our tmos platform to deliver new features and functions that address the complex changing needs of our customers although the bulk of our investment is software development concurrent development of tightly integrated hardware that delivers consistent guaranteed highperformance is a key part of our investment strategy we also look for opportunities to acquire technologies that will enable us to broaden the scope of our offerings and expand into adjacent markets 

expanding our addressable market 

since the introduction of tmos we have continually expanded our addressable market and the definition of application delivery through the acquisition and development of new technology in 2003 for example we entered the market for secure remote access through the acquisition of uroam inc and its firepass ssl vpn technology that has become the core of our current access policy manager apm offering the following year we entered the web application firewall market with the acquisition of magnifire websystems inc and its trafficshield security appliance which became the foundation of our application security manager asm in 2013 we introduced advanced firewall manager afm our network firewall in 2013 we also continued to expand our security offerings with the acquisition of versafe a provider of web antifraud antiphishing and antimalware solutions and in 2014 we acquired defensenet a cloudbased ddos protection service that complements our onpremise ddos solution and is currently available on our silverline saas platform during fiscal year 2016 we added new standalone security appliances ddos defender and ssl orchestrator to our family of security products these products are all integral components of our comprehensive security offering and tightly integrated with ltm and the other features and functions available on our products as a result of this strategy and our development and acquisition of technology in other related markets such as wan optimization java script programming and diameter signaling and routing we believe our current addressable market is significantly broader and more diverse than the adc market as industry analysts have traditionally defined it 

continuing to build and expand relationships with strategic technology partners 

early on we developed strategic technology partnerships with enterprise software vendors such as microsoft oracle vmware and others who had an established presence in large enterprises by taking advantage of icontrol our open application programming interface and icall a scripting framework that provides the ability to define data plane events such as threshold breaches and adjust the behavior of our products accordingly these vendors were able to equip their applications to control our products in the network enhancing overall application performance in return they provided us significant leverage in the selling process by recommending our products to their customers more recently we have worked closely with several of these vendors to develop configurations of our products called iapps that are specifically designed to simplify deployment and optimize the performance of their applications these solutions are available as templates which allow quick and easy configuration of our products for specific applications 

within the past two years we have developed partnerships with cisco hp microsoft and vmware to provide integrated application services for their software defined networking sdn offerings in addition we have established partnerships with amazon aws microsoft azure vmware vcloud air cisco aci and many others to provide cloudbased application services and solutions we plan to continue building on our existing relationships and to extend our competitive edge by developing new strategic partnerships with other technology leaders 

leveraging devcentral our online community of network architects and developers 

customization of our tmosbased products using irules enhances their “stickiness” by allowing customers to solve problems in both their applications and their networks that would be difficult if not impossible to solve by other means to promote the use of irules we host an online community devcentral where customers and partners discuss and share the ways in which they use irules to solve problems and enhance the security performance and availability of applications a corollary benefit is that many of the irules solutions posted by devcentral participants have become standard features in new releases of tmos devcentral also provides a valuable window into our customers’ constantly evolving needs that guide our product development 

f5 solutions 

our integrated family of tmosbased application services are available as software modules on our purposebuilt hardware as softwareonly virtual editions or ves that run on standard hypervisors and as online services on our silverline saas platform these products function as strategic points of control in ip networks inspecting modifying and directing traffic to optimize the security availability and delivery of applications and data to any user anywhere anytime and on any device our traffix diameter signaling and routing solutions address the complex needs of service providers and complement our tmosbased products by enabling fast reliable communications among the elements of their legacy infrastructures and their evolving packetbased 4glte networks and data centers we believe our products offer the most intelligent services and advanced functionality in the marketplace along with performance and flexibility that enable organizations to simplify management of their ip networks and data center operations by integrating disparate resources to reduce operating costs enhance productivity and improve service to employees customers and partners 

since 2004 we have expanded the breadth of features and functionality we offer well beyond the scope of application delivery networking as it has been traditionally defined today we also offer solutions that include application security secure 

remote access firewall protection wan optimization access policy management carrier grade network address translation diameter signaling policy enforcement and fraud detection opening up large opportunities in several adjacent markets

product development 

we believe our future success depends on our ability to maintain technology leadership by continuing to improve our products and by developing new products to meet the changing needs of our customers and partners our product development organization which includes product management and marketing employs standard processes for the development documentation and quality control of software and systems that are designed to meet these goals these processes include working with our business development and marketing teams customers and partners to identify new or improved solutions that meet the evolving needs of our addressable markets 

more than 90 percent of our product development organization is engaged in software development our principal software engineering team is located at our headquarters in seattle washington product development for apm and pem is located in san jose california asm traffix sdc and versafe product development is located in tel aviv israel our hardware engineering team is located in spokane washington san jose and tel aviv in addition we recently opened a dedicated facility for product testing and quality control in warsaw poland 

members of all our product development teams collaborate closely with one another to ensure the interoperability and performance of our hardware and software systems 

during the fiscal years ended september 30 2016  2015  and 2014  we had research and product development expenses of 3342 million  2966 million  and 2638 million  respectively 

customers 

our customers include a wide variety of enterprises and service providers among fortune 1000 and business week global 1000 companies including those in technology telecommunications financial services transportation education manufacturing and healthcare along with government customers in fiscal year 2016  sales outside of the americas represented 436  of our net revenues refer to note 9 of our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding our revenues by geographic area 

sales and marketing 

sales 

we sell our products and services to large enterprise customers and service providers through a variety of channels including distributors valueadded resellers vars and systems integrators a substantial amount of our revenue for fiscal year 2016  was derived from these channel sales our sales teams work closely with our channel partners and also sell our products and services directly to major accounts 

f5 sales teams our inside sales team generates and qualifies leads for regional sales managers and helps manage accounts by serving as a liaison between the field and internal corporate resources our field sales personnel are located in major cities in four sales regions the americas primarily the united states europe the middle east and africa emea japan and the asia pacific region apac field sales personnel work closely with our channel partners to assist them as necessary in the sale of our products and services to their customers we also sell our products and services directly to customers primarily large enterprises whose accounts are managed by our major account team field systems engineers support our regional sales managers and channel partners by participating in joint sales calls and providing presale technical resources as needed 

distributors and vars as a key component of our sales strategy we have established relationships with a number of large national and international distributors local and specialized distributors and vars we derive a majority of our product sales from vars and rely on our large distributors primarily for fulfillment 

our agreements with these channel partners are not exclusive and do not prevent them from selling competitive products these agreements typically have terms of one year with no obligation to renew and typically do not provide for exclusive sales territories or minimum purchase requirements 

for fiscal year 2016  sales to four of our worldwide distributors westcon group inc ingram micro inc avnet technology solutions and arrow ecs represented 187  149  133  and 101  of our total revenues respectively our agreements with these distributors are standard nonexclusive distribution agreements that renew automatically on an annual basis and generally can be terminated by either party with 30 days written notice prior to the start of any renewal term the agreements grant westcon group inc ingram micro inc avnet technology solutions and arrow ecs the right to distribute our products to resellers with no minimum purchase requirements 

systems integrators we also market our products through strategic relationships with systems integrators including dell services hp enterprise services and ibm global services who include our products as core components of application deployments or networkbased solutions they deploy for their customers in most cases systems integrators do not directly purchase our products for resale to their customers instead they typically recommend our products as part of broader solutions such as enterprise resource planning erp or customer relationship management crm solutions that incorporate our products for high availability and enhanced performance 

resellers and technology partners  historically our ability to compete with much larger companies has been strengthened through partnerships with large systems and software vendors currently we partner with dell and hewlettpackard who resell our products and with other large technology companies including microsoft oracle vmware and cisco who recommend our products to their customers management of these relationships is the responsibility of our business development team which closely monitors technology companies in adjacent and complementary markets for opportunities to partner with those whose solutions are complementary to ours and could enable us to expand our addressable market 

marketing 

our marketing strategy is driven by the belief that our continued success depends on our ability to understand and anticipate the dynamic needs of our addressable markets and to develop valuable solutions that meet those needs in line with this belief our marketing organization works directly with customers partners and our product development teams to identify and create innovative solutions to further enhance our leadership position 

to support the growing number of developers using our products including network and application architects we continue to promote and expand devcentral our online community website that provides technical resources to customers prospects and partners wanting to extend and optimize f5 solutions using irules and icall a key aspect of devcentral is an online forum where developers as well as application and network architects discuss and share solutions they have written with irules and icall at the end of fiscal year 2016  devcentral had more than 278000  registered members 

we also engage in a number of marketing programs and initiatives aimed at promoting our brand and creating market awareness of our technology and products these include actively participating in industry trade shows and joint marketing events with channel and technology partners and briefing industry analysts and members of the trade press on our latest products business relationships and technology partnerships in addition we market our products to chief information officers and other information technology professionals through targeted advertising direct mail and highprofile web events 

backlog 

at the end of fiscal years 2016  and 2015  we had product backlog of approximately 334 million  and 381 million  respectively backlog represents orders confirmed with a purchase order for products to be shipped generally within 90 days to customers with approved credit status orders are subject to cancellation rescheduling by customers or product specification changes by customers although we believe that the backlog orders are firm purchase orders may be cancelled by the customer prior to shipment without significant penalty for this reason we believe that our product backlog at any given date is not a reliable indicator of future revenues 

customer service and technical support 

we believe that our ability to provide consistent highquality customer service and technical support is a key factor in attracting and retaining large enterprise customers accordingly we offer a broad range of support services that include installation phone support hardware repair and replacement software updates online tools consulting and training services 

we provide these services directly to end users and also utilize a multitiered support model leveraging the capabilities of our channel partners when applicable our technical support staff is strategically located in regional service centers to support our global customer base 

prior to the installation of our products our services personnel work with customers to analyze their network needs and determine the best way to deploy our products and configure product features and functions to meet those needs our services personnel also provide onsite installation and training services to help customers make optimal use of product features and functions 

our customers typically purchase a oneyear maintenance contract which entitles them to an array of services provided by our technical support team maintenance services provided under the contract include online updates software error correction releases hardware repair and replacement and in the majority of cases roundtheclock call center support free updates of our software are available to customers with a current maintenance contract we also offer an online automated 

selfhelp customer support function called “ask f5” that provides answers to many commonly asked questions allowing customers to get information and solve problems quickly while significantly reducing the number of calls to our support desk this enables us to provide comprehensive customer support while keeping our supportrelated expenses at a manageable consistent level we also offer an online service called ihealth which allows customers to diagnose uptotheminute snapshots of their bigip systems diagnoses include tailored feedback about configuration issues or code defects a description of the issue recommendations for resolution and a link to further information in the askf5™ knowledge base 

f5 offers training classes for customers on the configuration and use of products including local and wide area network system administration and management we have a complete certification program that qualifies our partners and customers for having the appropriate skills to implement and use the functionality of our products to provide our customers with onsite and remote help we have a professional services team able to provide a full range of feebased consulting services including comprehensive network management documentation and performance analysis and capacity planning to assist in predicting future network requirements 

manufacturing 

we outsource the manufacturing of our preconfigured hardware platforms to third party contract manufacturers for assembly according to our specifications 

our purposebuilt systems are manufactured by flextronics international ltd subcontracting activity at flextronics encompasses prototype builds full production and direct fulfillment flextronics also performs the following activities on our behalf material procurement pcb assembly and test final assembly system test quality control direct shipment and warranty repairs we provide a rolling forecast that allows our contract manufacturers to stock component parts and other materials plan capacity and build finished goods inventory in anticipation of end user demand flextronics procures components in volumes consistent with our forecast assembles the products and tests them according to our specifications products are then shipped to our distributors valueadded resellers or end users generally we do not own the components title to the products transfers from the contract manufacturers to us and then to our customers upon shipment from a designated fulfillment location if the components are unused or the products are not sold within specified periods of time we may incur carrying charges or obsolete material charges for components that our contract manufacturers purchased to build products to meet our forecast or customer orders 

hardware components for our products consist primarily of commodity parts and certain custom components designed and approved by our hardware engineering group most of our components are purchased from sources which we believe are readily available from other suppliers however some components used in the assembly of our products are purchased from a single or limited source 

certain subassembly and testing processes of our products are performed at flextronics facility in zhuhai china the majority of our subassemblies are shipped to flextronics milpitas california plant for configuration and final testing and eventual distribution to our end users we also have capabilities to complete this process for some of our products in flextronics zhuhai china plant for distribution to apac and japan end users 

competition 

the expanding capabilities of our product offerings have enabled us to address a growing array of market opportunities many of which are outside the bounds of the application delivery networking market as defined and measured by industry analysts such as gartner group dell’oro and others in addition to server loadbalancing traffic management and other functions normally associated with application delivery our suite of integrated product modules has expanded our addressable market into security wan optimization application acceleration policy management and diameter signaling and routing where we compete with a growing number of companies not included among traditional adc vendors the ability to create custom network services using irules icontrol and icall has also enabled us our customers and our partners to design solutions to problems for which there is no offtheshelf solution as a result we believe the traditional definitions of our market do not encompass all of the features functions and capabilities of our products or accurately represent the addressable market for those products 

within the more narrowly defined traditional adc market several companies sell server loadbalancing products these include brocade communications systems inc citrix systems inc and a number of smaller competitors a10 networks array networks inc barracuda networks inc kemp technologies and radware ltd 

in related markets we compete with the following 



 the principal competitive factors in the markets in which we compete include product features and performance customer support brand recognition the scope of distribution and sales channels and pricing certain of our competitors have employed and may in the future adopt aggressive pricing policies to gain market share however because of the superior performance broad functionality and unique capabilities of our products which have resulted in high levels of customer satisfaction and growing brand awareness we believe that we can and will compete effectively against such pricing policies 

intellectual property 

we rely on a combination of patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights f5 holds 283  patents in the united states and has 46 international patents with applications pending for various aspects of our technology our future success depends in part on our ability to protect our proprietary rights to the technologies used in our principal products despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use trade secrets or other information that we regard as proprietary in addition the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights as fully as do the laws of the united states any issued patent may not preserve our proprietary position and competitors or others may develop technologies similar to or superior to our technology our failure to enforce and protect our intellectual property rights could harm our business operating results and financial condition 

in addition to our own proprietary software we incorporate software licensed from several thirdparty sources into our products these are generally term licenses which may renew annually and that generally provide for certain rights and licenses to support our customers post termination while we may not be able to renew certain of these licenses in the future we believe that alternative technologies for these licenses are available both domestically and internationally 

employees 

as of september 30 2016  we had 4395 fulltime employees including 1202  in product development 1617 in sales and marketing 1120  in professional services and technical support and 456  in accounting and finance administration and operations none of our employees is represented by a labor union we have experienced no work stoppages and believe that our employee relations are good

risk factors 

tableend in addition to the other information in this report the following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating our company and its business 

our business could be adversely impacted by conditions affecting the information technology market 

a substantial portion of our business depends on the demand for information technology by large enterprise customers and service providers in addition to the challenges presented by new cloud computing models we are dependent upon the overall economic health of our current and prospective customers and the continued growth and evolution of the internet international national regional and local economic conditions such as recessionary economic cycles protracted economic slowdown or further deterioration of the economy could adversely impact demand for our products demand for our products and services depends substantially upon the general demand for application delivery products and associated services which fluctuates based on numerous factors including capital spending levels and growth of our current and prospective customers as well as general economic conditions moreover the purchase of our products is often discretionary and may involve a significant commitment of capital and other resources future economic projections for the information technology sector are uncertain as companies continue to reassess their spending for technology projects and embrace new models for delivery of it services such as cloud computing and highly orchestrated software defined networking environments as a result spending priorities for our current and future customers may vary and demand for our products and services may be impacted in addition customer buying patterns are changing over time and more customers seek to rent software on a subscription basis and to reduce their total cost of ownership these evolving business models could lead to changes in demand and licensing strategies which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

cloudbased computing trends present competitive and execution risks 

customers are transitioning to a hybrid computing environment utilizing various cloudbased software and services accessed via various smart client devices pricing and delivery models are evolving and our competitors are developing and deploying cloudbased services for customers in addition new cloud infrastructures are enabling the emergence of new competitors including large cloud providers who offer their own adc functionality as well as smaller companies targeting the growing numbers of born in the cloud applications we are devoting significant resources to develop and deploy our own competing cloudbased software and services strategies while we believe our expertise and investments in software and infrastructure for cloudbased services provides us with a strong foundation to compete it is uncertain whether our strategies will attract the customers or generate the revenue required to be successful in addition to software development costs we are incurring costs to build and maintain infrastructure to support cloudcomputing services these costs may reduce the operating margins we have previously achieved whether we are successful in this new business model depends on our execution in a number of areas including 

 these new business models may reduce our revenues or operating margins and could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

industry consolidation may result in increased competition 

some of our competitors have made acquisitions or entered into partnerships or other strategic relationships to offer a more comprehensive solution than they had previously offered we have also entered into large strategic partnerships to enhance our competitive position in the marketplace as it companies attempt to strengthen or maintain their market positions in the evolving application delivery mobility cloud networking and cloud platform markets these companies continue to seek to deliver comprehensive it solutions to end users and combine enterpriselevel hardware and software solutions that may compete with our solutions and which could negatively impact our partnerships these consolidators or potential consolidators may have significantly greater financial technical and other resources than we do and may be better positioned to acquire and offer complementary products and services the companies resulting from these possible combinations may create more compelling product and service offerings and be able to offer greater pricing flexibility or sales and marketing support for such offerings than we can these heightened competitive pressures could result in a loss of customers or a reduction in our revenues or revenue growth rates all of which could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

we may not be able to compete effectively in the emerging application delivery networking market 

the markets we serve are new rapidly evolving and highly competitive and we expect competition to persist and intensify in the future our principal competitors in the application delivery networking market include brocade 

communications systems inc citrix systems inc radware ltd and a10 networks in related adc markets we compete with the following 

 we expect to continue to face additional competition as new participants enter our markets as we continue to expand globally we may see new competitors in different geographic regions in addition larger companies with significant resources brand recognition and sales channels may form alliances with or acquire competing application delivery networking solutions from other companies and emerge as significant competitors potential competitors may bundle their products or incorporate an internet traffic management or security component into existing products in a manner that discourages users from purchasing our products any of these circumstances may limit our opportunities for growth and negatively impact our financial performance 

our success depends on our timely development of new products and features market acceptance of new product offerings and proper management of the timing of the life cycle of our products 

the markets for our products and services are characterized by 

 our continued success depends on our ability to identify and develop new products and new features for our existing products to meet the demands of these changes and the acceptance of those products and features by our existing and target customers in addition our products must interoperate with our end customers’ it infrastructure which often have different specifications deploy products from multiple vendors and utilize multiple protocol standards our customers’ it infrastructure is becoming more complex and we may be reliant on orchestration and interoperability with third party vendors on whom we are reliant for testing and support of new product versions and configurations if we are unable to identify develop and deploy new products and new product features on a timely basis our business and results of operations may be harmed 

the current development cycle for our products is on average 1224 months the introduction of new products or product enhancements may shorten the life cycle of our existing products or replace sales of some of our current products thereby offsetting the benefit of even a successful product introduction and may cause customers to defer purchasing our existing products in anticipation of the new products this could harm our operating results by decreasing sales increasing our inventory levels of older products and exposing us to greater risk of product obsolescence we have also experienced and may in the future experience delays in developing and releasing new products and product enhancements this has led to and may in the future lead to delayed sales increased expenses and lower quarterly revenue than anticipated also in the development of our products we have experienced delays in the prototyping of our products which in turn has led to delays in product introductions in addition complexity and difficulties in managing product transitions at the endoflife stage of a product can create excess inventory of components associated with the outgoing product that can lead to increased expenses any or all of the above problems could materially harm our business and results of operations 

our success depends on sales and continued innovation of our application delivery networking product lines 

for the fiscal year ended september 30 2016  we derived approximately 988  of our net product revenues or approximately 468  of our total net revenues from sales of our application delivery networking adn product lines we expect to continue to derive a significant portion of our net revenues from sales of our adn products in the future implementation of our strategy depends upon these products being able to solve critical network availability performance and security problems for our customers if our adn products are unable to solve these problems for our customers or if we are unable to sustain the high levels of innovation in our adn product feature set needed to maintain leadership in what will continue to be a competitive market environment our business and results of operations will be harmed 

undetected software or hardware errors or security vulnerabilities may harm our business and results of operations 

our products may contain undetected errors or defects when first introduced or as new versions are released we have experienced these errors or defects in the past in connection with new products and product upgrades as our products and customer it infrastructures become increasingly complex customers may experience unforeseen errors in implementing our products into their it environments we expect that these errors or defects will be found from time to time in new or enhanced products after commencement of commercial shipments these problems may cause us to incur significant warranty and repair costs divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts and cause significant customer relations problems we may also be subject to liability claims for damages related to product errors or defects while we carry insurance policies covering this type of liability these policies may not provide sufficient protection should a claim be asserted a material product liability claim may harm our business and results of operations 

our products must successfully operate with products from other vendors as a result when problems occur in a network it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem the occurrence of software or hardware problems whether caused by our products or another vendor’s products may result in the delay or loss of market acceptance of our products the occurrence of any of these problems may harm our business and results of operations 

our products are used to manage critical applications and data for customers and third parties may attempt to exploit security vulnerabilities in our products as well as our internal it systems as we continue to focus on the development and marketing of security solutions we become a bigger target for malicious computer hackers who wish to exploit security vulnerabilities in our products or it systems these problems may cause us to incur significant remediation costs divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts and cause significant customer relations problems adverse publicity related to security vulnerabilities or damage to a customer’s operations due to exploitation of security vulnerability in our products or it systems may harm our business and results of operations 

any errors defects or vulnerabilities in our products or it systems could result in 

 we are dependent on various information technology systems and failures of or interruptions to those systems could harm our business 

many of our business processes depend upon our it systems the systems and processes of third parties and on interfaces with the systems of third parties for example our order entry system provides information to the systems of our contract manufacturers which enables them to build and ship our products if those systems fail or are interrupted or if our ability to connect to or interact with one or more networks is interrupted our processes may function at a diminished level or not at all this would harm our ability to ship products and our financial results may be harmed 

in addition reconfiguring our it systems or other business processes in response to changing business needs may be timeconsuming and costly to the extent this impacted our ability to react timely to specific market or business opportunities our financial results may be harmed 

our failure to adequately protect personal information could have a material adverse effect on our business 

a wide variety of local state national and international laws directives and regulations apply to the collection use retention protection disclosure transfer and other processing of personal data these data protection and privacyrelated laws and regulations continue to evolve and may result in everincreasing regulatory and public scrutiny and escalating levels of enforcement and sanctions and increased costs of compliance certain safeharbor exemptions upon which the company relies for data transfers have been challenged and may no longer be available to us in the future our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or to protect such data could result in enforcement action against us including fines imprisonment of company officials and public censure claims for damages by endcustomers and other affected individuals damage to our reputation and loss of goodwill both in relation to existing endcustomers and prospective endcustomers any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations financial performance and business changing definitions of personal data and personal information within the european union the united states and elsewhere especially relating to classification of ip addresses machine identification location data and other information may limit or inhibit our ability to operate or expand our business including limiting strategic partnerships that may involve the sharing of data the evolving data protection regulatory environment may require significant management attention and financial resources to analyze and modify our it infrastructure to meet these changing requirements all of which could reduce our operating margins and impact our operating results and financial condition 

our success depends on our key personnel and our ability to hire retain and motivate qualified executives sales and marketing operations product development and professional services personnel 

our success depends in large part on our ability to attract engage retain and integrate qualified executives and other key employees throughout all areas of our business in order to attract and retain executives and other key employees in a competitive marketplace we must provide a competitive compensation package including cash and equitybased compensation if we do not obtain the stockholder approval needed to continue granting equity compensation in a competitive manner our ability to attract retain and motivate executives and key employees could be weakened failure to successfully hire executives and key employees or the loss of any executives and key employees could have a significant impact on our operations further changes in our management team may be disruptive to our business and any failure to successfully integrate key new hires or promoted employees could adversely affect our business and results of operations in addition we recently announced the board of directors has formed a committee to initiate a search for a replacement for john mcadam as the company’s ceo upon his retirement the process of searching for and transitioning to a new chief executive could be disruptive to our business and could adversely affect our business and results of operations the complexity of our application delivery networking products and their integration into existing networks and ongoing support as well as the sophistication of our sales and marketing effort requires us to retain highly trained developers professional services customer support and sales personnel competition for qualified developers professional services customer support and sales personnel in our industry is intense especially in silicon valley and seattle where we have substantial operations and a need for highly skilled personnel because of the limited number of people available with the necessary technical skills and understanding of our products also to the extent we hire personnel from competitors we may be subject to allegations that they have been improperly solicited that they have divulged proprietary or other confidential information that they have violated noncompete obligations to their prior employers or that their former employers own their inventions or other work product our ability to hire and retain these personnel may be adversely affected by volatility or reductions in the price of our common stock or our ability to get approval from shareholders to offer additional common stock to our employees since these employees are generally granted restricted stock units the loss of services of any of our key personnel the inability to retain and attract qualified personnel in the future or delays in hiring qualified personnel may harm our business and results of operations 

the average selling price of our products may decrease and our costs may increase which may negatively impact revenues and profits 

it is possible that the average selling prices of our products will decrease in the future in response to competitive pricing pressures increased sales discounts new product introductions by us or our competitors as well as the shift to more software consumption based and “as a service based” models or other factors therefore in order to maintain our profits we must develop and introduce new products and product enhancements on a timely basis and continually reduce our product costs our failure to do so could cause our revenue and profits to decline which would harm our business and results of operations in addition we may experience substantial periodtoperiod fluctuations in future operating results due to the erosion of our average selling prices 

our business may be harmed if our contract manufacturers are not able to provide us with adequate supplies of our products or if a single source of hardware assembly is lost or impaired 

we outsource the manufacturing of our hardware platforms to third party contract manufacturers who assemble these hardware platforms to our specifications we have experienced minor delays in shipments from contract manufacturers in the past however if we experience major delays in the future or other problems such as inferior quality and insufficient quantity of product any one or a combination of these factors may harm our business and results of operations the inability of our contract manufacturers to provide us with adequate supplies of our products or the loss of one or more of our contract manufacturers may cause a delay in our ability to fulfill orders while we obtain a replacement manufacturer and may harm our business and results of operations in particular we currently subcontract manufacturing of our application delivery networking products to a single contract manufacturer with whom we do not have a longterm contract if our arrangement with this single source of hardware assembly was terminated or otherwise impaired and we were not able to engage another contract manufacturer in a timely manner our business financial condition and results of operation could be adversely affected 

if the demand for our products grows we will need to increase our raw material and component purchases contract manufacturing capacity and internal test and quality control functions any disruptions in product flow may limit our revenue may harm our competitive position and may result in additional costs or cancellation of orders by our customers 

our business could suffer if there are any interruptions or delays in the supply of hardware components from our thirdparty sources 

we currently purchase several hardware components used in the assembly of our products from a number of single or limited sources lead times for these components vary significantly the unavailability of suitable components any interruption or delay in the supply of any of these hardware components or the inability to procure a similar component from alternate sources at acceptable prices within a reasonable time may delay assembly and sales of our products and hence our revenues and may harm our business and results of operations 

it is difficult to predict our future operating results because we have an unpredictable sales cycle 

our products have a lengthy sales cycle and the timing of our revenue is difficult to predict historically our sales cycle has ranged from approximately two to three months and has tended to lengthen as our products become increasingly complex also as our distribution strategy is focused on a channel model utilizing valueadded resellers distributors and systems integrators the level of variability in the length of sales cycle across transactions has increased and made it more difficult to predict the timing of many of our sales transactions sales of our products require us to educate potential customers in their use and benefits sales of our products are subject to delays from the lengthy internal budgeting approval and competitive evaluation processes that large enterprises and governmental entities may require for example customers frequently begin by evaluating our products on a limited basis and devote time and resources to testing our products before they decide whether or not to purchase customers may also defer orders as a result of anticipated releases of new products or enhancements by our competitors or us as a result our products have an unpredictable sales cycle that contributes to the uncertainty of our future operating results 

we may not be able to sustain or develop new distribution relationships and a reduction or delay in sales to significant distribution partners could hurt our business 

we sell our products and services through multiple distribution channels in the united states and internationally including leading industry distributors valueadded resellers systems integrators service providers and other indirect channel partners we have a limited number of agreements with companies in these channels and we may not be able to increase our number of distribution relationships or maintain our existing relationships recruiting and retaining qualified channel partners and training them in our technologies requires significant time and resources these channel partners may also market sell and support products and services that are competitive with ours and may devote more resources to the marketing sales and support of such competitive products our indirect sales channel structure could subject us to lawsuits potential liability and reputational harm if for example any of our channel partners misrepresent the functionality of our products or services to customers or violate laws or our corporate policies if we are unable to establish or maintain our indirect sales channels our business and results of operations will be harmed in addition four worldwide distributors of our products accounted for 570  of our total net revenue for fiscal year 2016  four worldwide distributors of our products accounted for 579  of our total net revenue for fiscal year 2015  a substantial reduction or delay in sales of our products to these distribution partners if not replaced by sales to other indirect channel partners and distributors could harm our business operating results and financial condition 

a portion of our revenue is generated by sales to government entities which are subject to a number of challenges and risks 

sales to us and foreign federal state and local governmental agency endcustomers account for a significant portion of our revenues and we may in the future increase sales to government entities sales to government entities are subject to a number of risks selling to government entities can be highly competitive expensive and time consuming often requiring significant upfront time and expense without any assurance that these efforts will generate a sale the substantial majority of our sales to date to government entities have been made indirectly through our channel partners government certification requirements for products like ours may change thereby restricting our ability to sell into the federal government sector until we have attained the revised certification government demand and payment for our products and services may be impacted by public sector budgetary cycles and funding authorizations with funding reductions or delays adversely affecting public sector demand for our products and services government entities may have statutory contractual or other legal rights to terminate contracts with our distributors and resellers for convenience or due to a default and any such termination may adversely impact our future operating results governments routinely investigate and audit government contractors’ administrative processes and any unfavorable audit could result in the government refusing to continue buying our products and services a reduction of revenue or fines or civil or criminal liability if the audit uncovers improper or illegal activities which could adversely impact our operating results in a material way finally for purchases by the us government the government may require certain products to be manufactured in the united states and other relatively high cost manufacturing locations and we may not manufacture all products in locations that meet the requirements of the us government affecting our ability to sell these products to the us government 

misuse of our products could harm our reputation 

our products may be misused by endcustomers or third parties that obtain access to our products for example our products could be used to censor private access to certain information on the internet such use of our products for censorship could result in negative publicity and damage to our reputation in addition as many of our products are subject to export control regulations diversion of our products to restricted third parties by others could result in investigations penalties fines trade restrictions and negative publicity that could damage our reputation and materially impact our business operating results and financial condition 

our quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate in future periods which may cause our stock price to fluctuate 

our quarterly and annual operating results have varied significantly in the past and could vary significantly in the future which makes it difficult for us to predict our future operating results our operating results may fluctuate due to a variety of factors many of which are outside of our control including the changing and recently volatile us and global economic environment which may cause our stock price to fluctuate in particular we anticipate that the size of customer orders may increase as we continue to focus on larger business accounts a delay in the recognition of revenue even from just one account may have a significant negative impact on our results of operations for a given period in the past a majority of our sales have been realized near the end of a quarter accordingly a delay in an anticipated sale past the end of a particular quarter may negatively impact our results of operations for that quarter or in some cases that fiscal year additionally we have exposure to the credit risks of some of our customers and subtenants although we have programs in place that are designed to monitor and mitigate the associated risk there can be no assurance that such programs will be effective in reducing our credit risks adequately we monitor individual payment capability in granting credit arrangements seek to limit the total credit to amounts we believe our customers can pay and maintain reserves we believe are adequate to cover exposure for potential losses if there is a deterioration of a subtenant’s or a major customer’s creditworthiness or actual defaults are higher than expected future losses if incurred could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our operating results further our operating results may be below the expectations of securities analysts and investors in future quarters or years our failure to meet these expectations will likely harm the market price of our common stock such a decline could occur and has occurred in the past even when we have met our publicly stated revenue andor earnings guidance 

reliance on shipments at the end of the quarter could cause our revenue for the applicable period to fall below expected levels 

as a result of customer buying patterns and the efforts of our sales force and channel partners to meet or exceed their sales objectives we have historically received a substantial portion of sales orders and generated a substantial portion of revenue during the last few weeks of each fiscal quarter in addition any significant interruption in our information technology systems which manage critical functions such as order processing revenue recognition financial forecasts inventory and supply chain management and trade compliance reviews could result in delayed order fulfillment and decreased revenue for that fiscal quarter if expected revenue at the end of any fiscal quarter is delayed for any reason including the failure of anticipated purchase orders to materialize our third party contract manufacturers’ inability to manufacture and ship products prior to fiscal quarterend to fulfill purchase orders received near the end of the fiscal quarter our failure to manage inventory to meet demand our inability to release new products on schedule any failure of our systems related to order review and processing or any delays in shipments based on trade compliance requirements our revenue for that quarter could fall below our expectations resulting in a decline in the trading price of our common stock 

changes in financial accounting standards may cause adverse unexpected revenue fluctuations and affect our reported results of operations 

a change in accounting policies can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective new pronouncements and varying interpretations of existing pronouncements have occurred with frequency and may occur in the future changes to existing rules or changes to the interpretations of existing rules could lead to changes in our accounting practices and such changes could adversely affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business 

we may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities 

our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely affected by nondeductible stockbased compensation changes in the research and development tax credit laws earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and being higher than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates transfer pricing adjustments not meeting the terms and conditions of tax holidays or incentives changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in actual results versus our estimates or changes in tax laws regulations accounting principles or interpretations thereof including changes to the tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals the us the european union and its member states and a number of other countries are actively pursuing changes in this regard in addition like other companies we may be subject to examination of our income tax returns by the us internal revenue service and other tax authorities while we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes from such examinations and the adequacy of our provision for income taxes there can be no assurance that such provision is sufficient and that a determination by a tax authority will not have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

we are subject to governmental export and import controls that could subject us to liability or impair our ability to compete in international markets 

our products are subject to us export controls and may be exported outside the us only with the required level of export license or through an export license exception because we incorporate encryption technology into our products in addition various countries regulate the import of certain encryption technology and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute our products or our customers’ ability to implement our products in those countries changes in our products or changes in export and import regulations may create delays in the introduction of our products in international markets prevent our customers with international operations from deploying our products throughout their global systems or in some cases prevent the export or import of our products to certain countries altogether any change in export or import regulations or related legislation shift in approach to the enforcement or scope of existing regulations or change in the countries persons or technologies targeted by such regulations could result in decreased use of our products by or in our decreased ability to export or sell our products to existing or potential customers with international operations any decreased use of our products or limitation on our ability to export or sell our products would likely adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property and our products may infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties 

we rely on a combination of patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure of confidential and proprietary information to protect our intellectual property rights despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology monitoring unauthorized use of our products is difficult and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent 

misappropriation of our technology particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 

our industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the ordinary course of our business we are involved in disputes and licensing discussions with others regarding their claimed proprietary rights and cannot provide assurance that we will always successfully defend ourselves against such claims and such matters are subject to many uncertainties and outcomes are not predictable with assurance we expect that infringement claims may increase as the number of products and competitors in our market increases and overlaps occur also as we have gained greater visibility market exposure and competitive success we face a higher risk of being the subject of intellectual property infringement claims if we are found to infringe the proprietary rights of others or if we otherwise settle such claims we could be compelled to pay damages or royalties and either obtain a license to those intellectual property rights or alter our products so that they no longer infringe upon such proprietary rights any license could be very expensive to obtain or may not be available at all or may require us to make royalty payments which could adversely affect gross margins in future periods the actual liability in any such matters may be materially different from our estimate if any which could result in the need to adjust the liability and record additional expenses similarly changing our products or processes to avoid infringing upon the rights of others may be costly or impractical in addition we have initiated and may in the future initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to determine the scope and validity of our proprietary rights or those of our competitors any of these claims whether claims that we are infringing the proprietary rights of others or vice versa with or without merit may be timeconsuming result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel or require us to cease using infringing technology develop noninfringing technology or enter into royalty or licensing agreements further our license agreements typically require us to indemnify our customers distributors and resellers for infringement actions related to our technology which could cause us to become involved in infringement claims made against our customers distributors or resellers any of the abovedescribed circumstances relating to intellectual property rights disputes could result in our business and results of operations being harmed 

we incorporate open source software into our products although we monitor our use of open source closely the terms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by us courts and there is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products we could also be subject to similar conditions or restrictions should there be any changes in the licensing terms of the open source software incorporated into our products in either event we could be required to seek licenses from third parties in order to continue offering our products to reengineer our products or to discontinue the sale of our products in the event reengineering cannot be accomplished on a timely or successful basis any of which could adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

many of our products include intellectual property licensed from third parties in the future it may be necessary to renew licenses for third party intellectual property or obtain new licenses for other technology these third party licenses may not be available to us on acceptable terms if at all the inability to obtain certain licenses or litigation regarding the interpretation or enforcement of license rights and related intellectual property issues could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition furthermore we license some third party intellectual property on a nonexclusive basis and this may limit our ability to protect our intellectual property rights in our products 

our operating results are exposed to risks associated with international commerce 

as our international sales increase our operating results become more exposed to international operating risks additionally our international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks including the following 



 in addition the june 2016 announcement of the results of the united kingdom european union membership referendum commonly referred to as brexit advising for the exit of the united kingdom from the european union has created economic financial and regulatory uncertainty which may cause our customers to closely monitor their costs and reduce their spending on our products and services 

we must hire and train experienced personnel to staff and manage our foreign operations to the extent that we experience difficulties in recruiting training managing and retaining an international staff and specifically staff related to sales management and sales personnel we may experience difficulties in sales productivity in foreign markets we also enter into strategic distributor and reseller relationships with companies in certain international markets where we do not have a local presence if we are not able to maintain successful strategic distributor relationships internationally or recruit additional companies to enter into strategic distributor relationships our future success in these international markets could be limited business practices in the international markets that we serve may differ from those in the united states and may require us in the future to include terms other than our standard terms in customer contracts we intend to continue expanding into international markets sales outside of the americas represented 436  and 427  of our net revenues for the fiscal years ended september 30 2016  and 2015  respectively 

these factors and other factors could harm our ability to gain future international revenues and consequently materially impact our business operating results and financial condition the expansion of our existing international operations and entry into additional international markets will require significant management attention and financial resources our failure to successfully manage our international operations and the associated risks effectively could limit the future growth of our business 

changes in governmental regulations could negatively affect our revenues 

many of our products are subject to various regulations promulgated by the united states and various foreign governments including but not limited to environmental regulations and regulations implementing export license requirements and restrictions on the import or export of some technologies especially encryption technology changes in governmental regulation and our inability or failure to obtain required approvals permits or registrations could harm our international and domestic sales and adversely affect our revenues business and operations 

new regulations related to conflict minerals may force us to incur additional expenses and could limit the supply and increase the costs of certain metals and minerals used in the manufacturing of our products 

in august 2012 the sec adopted new requirements under the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 or the doddfrank act for companies that use certain minerals and derivative metals referred to as conflict minerals regardless of their country of origin in their products whether or not these products are manufactured by third parties the doddfrank act requires companies to perform due diligence and disclose whether or not such minerals originate from the democratic republic of congo or adjoining countries we filed a report on form sd with the sec regarding such matters on may 31 2016 these new requirements could adversely affect the sourcing availability and pricing of minerals or metals used in the manufacture of our products and the numerous components that go into our products all of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results in addition we will incur additional costs to comply with the disclosure requirements including costs related to determining the source of any relevant minerals and metals used in our products we have a complex supply chain and many components are sourced through our contract manufacturer and we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins for these minerals and metals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement as a result we may face reputational challenges with our customers and other stakeholders and possible regulatory risk 

we face litigation risks 

we are a party to lawsuits in the normal course of our business litigation in general and intellectual property and securities litigation in particular can be expensive lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations moreover the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict responding to lawsuits has been and will likely continue to be expensive and timeconsuming for us an unfavorable resolution of these lawsuits could adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

acquisitions present many risks and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that are contemplated at the time of the transaction 

with respect to our past acquisitions as well as any other future acquisitions we may undertake we may find that the acquired businesses products or technologies do not further our business strategy as expected that we paid more than what the assets are later worth or that economic conditions change all of which may generate future impairment charges our acquisitions may be viewed negatively by customers financial markets or investors there may be difficulty integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired business and we may have difficulty retaining the key personnel of the acquired business we may have difficulty in integrating the acquired technologies or products with our existing product lines our ongoing business and management’s attention may be disrupted or diverted by transition or integration issues and the complexity of managing geographically and culturally diverse locations we may have difficulty maintaining uniform standards controls procedures and policies across locations we may experience significant problems or liabilities associated with product quality technology and other matters 

our inability to successfully operate and integrate newlyacquired businesses appropriately effectively and in a timely manner or to retain key personnel of any acquired business could have a material adverse effect on our ability to take advantage of further growth in demand for integrated traffic management and security solutions and other advances in technology as well as on our revenues gross margins and expenses 

antitakeover provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us 

our board of directors has the authority to issue up to 10000000 shares of preferred stock and to determine the price rights preferences privileges and restrictions including voting rights of those shares without any further vote or action by the shareholders the rights of the holders of common stock may be subject to and may be adversely affected by the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future the issuance of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a change of control of our company without further action by our shareholders and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of the holders of common stock further certain provisions of our bylaws including a provision limiting the ability of shareholders to raise matters at a meeting of shareholders without giving advance notice may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or management of our company which could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock similarly state antitakeover laws in the state of washington related to corporate takeovers may prevent or delay a change of control of our company 

our stock price could be volatile particularly during times of economic uncertainty and volatility in domestic and international stock markets 

our stock price has been volatile and has fluctuated significantly in the past the trading price of our stock is likely to continue to be volatile and subject to fluctuations in the future some of the factors that could significantly affect the market price of our stock include 

 the stock market in general and the market for technology companies in particular have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations these fluctuations have often been unrelated or disproportionate to operating performance the fluctuations may continue in the future and this could significantly impact the value of our stock and your investment 

we face risks associated with having operations and employees located in israel 

we have offices and employees located in israel as a result political economic and military conditions in israel directly affect our operations the future of peace efforts between israel and its arab neighbors remains uncertain there has been a significant increase in hostilities and political unrest in israel in the past year the effects of these hostilities and violence on the israeli economy and our operations in israel are unclear and we cannot predict the effect on us of further increases in these hostilities or future armed conflict political instability or violence in the region in addition many of our employees in israel are obligated to perform annual reserve duty in the israeli military and are subject to being called for active duty under emergency circumstances we cannot predict the full impact of these conditions on us in the future particularly if emergency circumstances or an escalation in the political situation occurs if many of our employees in israel are called for active duty for a significant period of time our operations and our business could be disrupted and may not be able to function at full capacity current or future tensions and conflicts in the middle east could adversely affect our business operating results financial condition and cash flows

our management team monitors and analyzes a number of key performance indicators in order to manage our business and evaluate our financial and operating performance on a consolidated basis those indicators include 





critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements 

revenue recognition we sell products through distributors resellers and directly to end users revenue is recognized provided that all of the following criteria have been met 

 revenue from the sale of products is generally recognized when the product has been shipped and the customer is obligated to pay for the product when rights of return are present and we cannot estimate returns revenue is recognized when such rights of return lapse payment terms to domestic customers are generally net 30 days to net 45 days payment terms to international customers range from net 30 days to net 120 days based on normal and customary trade practices in the individual markets we offer extended payment terms to certain customers in which case revenue is recognized when payments are due 

revenues for postcontract customer support pcs are recognized on a straightline basis over the service contract term pcs includes a limited period of telephone support updates repair or replacement of any failed product or component that fails during the term of the agreement bug fixes and rights to upgrades when and if available consulting services are customarily billed at fixed hourly rates plus outofpocket expenses and revenues are recognized when the consulting has been completed training revenue is recognized when the training has been completed 

arrangement consideration is first allocated between software consisting of nonessential and standalone software and nonsoftware deliverables the majority of our products are hardware appliances which contain software essential to the overall functionality of the products hardware appliances are generally sold with pcs and on occasion with consulting andor training services arrangement consideration in such multiple element transactions is allocated to each element based on a fair value hierarchy where the selling price for an element is based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe if available thirdparty evidence tpe if available and vsoe is not available or the best estimate of selling price besp if neither vsoe or tpe is available 

for software deliverables we allocate revenue between multiple elements based on software revenue recognition guidance software revenue recognition guidance requires revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements to be allocated to each element based on the relative fair values of those elements the fair value of an element must be based on vsoe where fair value of delivered elements is not available revenue is recognized on the “residual method” based on the fair value of undelivered elements if evidence of fair value of one or more undelivered elements does not exist all revenue is deferred and recognized at the earlier of the delivery of those elements or the establishment of fair value of the remaining undelivered elements 

we establish vsoe for our products pcs consulting and training services based on the sales price charged for each element when sold separately the sales price is discounted from the applicable list price based on various factors including the type of customer volume of sales geographic region and program level our list prices are generally not fair value as discounts 

may be given based on the factors enumerated above we use historical sales transactions to determine whether vsoe can be established for each of the elements in most instances vsoe of fair value is the sales price of actual standalone unbundled transactions within the past 12 month period when a substantial majority of transactions more than 80 are priced within a narrow range which we have determined to be plus or minus 15 of the median sales price 

we believe that the vsoe of fair value of training and consulting services is represented by the billable rate per hour based on the rates charged to customers when they purchase standalone training or consulting services the price of consulting services is not based on the type of customer volume of sales geographic region or program level 

we are typically not able to determine vsoe or tpe for nonsoftware products tpe is determined based on competitor prices for similar elements when sold separately generally our gotomarket strategy differs from that of other competitive products or services in its markets and our offerings contain a significant level of differentiation such that the comparable pricing of products with similar functionality cannot be obtained furthermore we are unable to reliably determine the selling prices on a standalone basis of similar products offered by our competitors 

when we are unable to establish selling price using vsoe or tpe we use besp in our allocation of arrangement consideration the objective of besp is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a standalone basis we have been able to establish besp through the list price less a discount deemed appropriate to maintain a reasonable gross margin management regularly reviews gross margin information at the consolidated level nonsoftware product besp is determined through our review of historical sales transactions within the past 12 month period additional factors considered in determining an appropriate besp include but are not limited to cost of products pricing practices geographies customer classes and distribution channels 

we regularly validate the vsoe of fair value and besp for elements in its multiple element arrangements we account for taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities on a net basis and excluded these amounts from revenues 

reserve for doubtful accounts estimates are used in determining our allowance for doubtful accounts and are based upon an assessment of selected accounts and as a percentage of our remaining accounts receivable by aging category in determining these percentages we evaluate historical writeoffs current trends in the credit quality of our customer base as well as changes in the credit policies we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition and do not require any collateral if there is deterioration of a major customer’s credit worthiness or actual defaults are higher than our historical experience our allowance for doubtful accounts may not be sufficient 

reserve for product returns in some instances product revenue from distributors is subject to agreements allowing rights of return product returns are estimated based on historical experience and are recorded at the time revenues are recognized accordingly we reduce recognized revenue for estimated future returns at the time revenue is recorded when rights of return are present and we cannot estimate returns revenue is recognized when such rights lapse the estimates for returns are adjusted periodically based upon changes in historical rates of returns and other related factors it is possible that these estimates will change in the future or that the actual amounts could vary from our estimates 

accounting for income taxes we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure including assessing the risks associated with tax audits together with assessing temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities due to the evolving nature and complexity of tax rules combined with the large number of jurisdictions in which we operate it is possible that our estimates of our tax liability could change in the future which may result in additional tax liabilities and adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

stockbased compensation we account for stockbased compensation using the straightline attribution method for recognizing compensation expense over the requisite service period of the related award we recognized 1568 million  and 1456 million  of stockbased compensation expense for the years ended september 30 2016  and 2015  respectively as of september 30 2016  there was 1191 million  of total unrecognized stockbased compensation cost the majority of which will be recognized over the next two  years going forward stockbased compensation expenses may increase as we issue additional equitybased awards to continue to attract and retain key employees 

we issue incentive awards to our employees through stockbased compensation consisting of restricted stock units rsus the value of rsus is determined using the fair value method which in this case is based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock on the date of grant 

we recognize compensation expense for only the portion of rsus that are expected to vest therefore we apply estimated forfeiture rates that are derived from historical employee termination behavior based on historical differences with forfeitures of stockbased awards granted to our executive officers and board of directors versus grants awarded to all other employees we developed separate forfeiture expectations for these two groups 

we recognize compensation costs for awards with performance conditions when we conclude it is probable that the performance condition will be achieved we reassess the probability of vesting at each balance sheet date and adjust compensation costs based on our probability assessment 

common stock repurchase on april 20 2016  we announced that our board of directors authorized an additional 10 billion  for our common stock share repurchase program this new authorization is incremental to the existing 24 billion  program initially approved in october 2010 and expanded in each fiscal year acquisitions for the share repurchase programs will be made from time to time in private transactions or open market purchases as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements the programs can be terminated at any time during fiscal year 2016 we repurchased and retired 6608980  shares at an average price of 10594  per share and as of september 30 2016 we had 7737 million  remaining authorized to purchase shares 

goodwill and acquired intangible assets goodwill represents the excess purchase price over the estimated fair value of net assets acquired as of the acquisition date we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests when impairment indicators are identified goodwill is written down when impaired goodwill was recorded in connection with the acquisition of defensenet inc in fiscal year 2014 versafe ltd and linerate systems inc in fiscal year 2013 traffix systems in fiscal year 2012 acopia networks inc in fiscal year 2007 swan labs inc in fiscal year 2006 magnifire websystems inc in fiscal year 2004 and uroam inc in fiscal year 2003 for our annual goodwill impairment test in all periods to date we have operated under one reporting unit and the fair value of the reporting unit has been determined by the company’s enterprise value we perform our annual goodwill impairment test during the second fiscal quarter 

as part of the annual goodwill impairment test we first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary if as a result of its qualitative assessment it is morelikelythannot ie greater than 50 chance that the fair value of our reporting unit is less than its carrying amount the quantitative impairment test will be required otherwise no further testing will be required 

examples of events and circumstances that might indicate that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount include macroeconomic conditions such as deterioration in the entity’s operating environment or industry or market considerations entityspecific events such as increasing costs declining financial performance or loss of key personnel or other events such as an expectation that a reporting unit will be sold or a sustained decrease in the stock price on either an absolute basis or relative to peers 

if it is determined as a result of the qualitative assessment that it is morelikelythannot that the fair value of our reporting unit is less than its carrying amount the provisions of authoritative guidance require that we perform a twostep impairment test on goodwill the first step of the test identifies whether potential impairment may have occurred while the second step of the test measures the amount of the impairment if any impairment is recognized when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its fair value in march 2016 we completed a qualitative assessment of potential impairment indicators and concluded that it was morelikelythannot that the fair value of our reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount the company considered potential impairment indicators of goodwill and acquired intangible assets at september 30 2016 and noted no indicators of impairment 

software development costs the authoritative guidance requires certain internal software development costs related to software to be sold to be capitalized upon the establishment of technological feasibility our software development costs incurred subsequent to achieving technological feasibility have not been significant and all software development costs have been expensed as research and development activities as incurred 

internal use software  in accordance with the authoritative guidance we capitalize application development stage costs associated with the development of new functionality for internaluse software and software developed related to our saasbased product offerings the capitalized costs are then amortized over the estimated useful life of the software which is generally three to five years and are included in property and equipment in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 

investments our investments are diversified among highcredit quality debt securities in accordance with our investment policy we classify our investments as availableforsale which are reported at fair market value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss in stockholders’ equity realized gains and losses and declines in value of these investments judged to be other than temporary are included in other income expense to date we have not deemed it necessary to record any charges related to otherthantemporary declines in the estimated fair values of 

our marketable debt securities however the fair value of our investments is subject to volatility declines in the fair value of our investments judged to be other than temporary could adversely affect our future operating results

other income net other income net consists primarily of interest income and foreign currency transaction gains and losses other income net decreased 702  in fiscal year 2016  as compared to fiscal year 2015  and increased 1231  in fiscal year 2015  as compared to fiscal year 2014  interest income was 66 million  54 million  and 57 million  for fiscal years 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively the decrease in other income net for fiscal year 2016  was primarily due to 72 million  in foreign currency losses compared to the prior year the increase in other income net for fiscal year 2015  as compared to fiscal year 2014  was primarily due to 40 million  in foreign currency gains compared to the prior year and a nonrecurring charge of 10 million  related to a legal settlement that occurred in the first quarter of fiscal year 2014

we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount we believe is morelikelythannot to be realized in making these determinations we consider historical and projected taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the appropriateness of a valuation allowance the net increase in the valuation allowance of 42 million  for fiscal year 2016 and 29 million  for fiscal year 2015 was primarily related to tax net operating losses incurred in certain foreign jurisdictions and state tax credit carryforwards our net deferred tax assets as of september 30 2016  2015  and 2014  were 494 million  557 million  and 431 million  respectively 

our worldwide effective tax rate may fluctuate based on a number of factors including variations in projected taxable income in the various geographic locations in which we operate changes in the valuation of our net deferred tax assets resolution of potential exposures tax positions taken on tax returns filed in the various geographic locations in which we operate and the introduction of new accounting standards or changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof in the various geographic locations in which we operate we have recorded liabilities to address potential tax exposures related to business and income tax positions we have taken that could be challenged by taxing authorities the ultimate resolution of these potential exposures may be greater or less than the liabilities recorded which could result in an adjustment to our future tax expense

cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and longterm investments totaled 11588 million  as of september 30 2016  compared to 11720 million  as of september 30 2015  representing a decrease of 132 million  the decrease was primarily due to 7001 million  of cash required for the repurchase of outstanding common stock under our share repurchase program in fiscal 2016  and 635 million  of capital expenditures related to the expansion of our facilities to support our operations worldwide partially offset by cash provided by operating activities of 7115 million  as of september 30 2016  307  of our cash and cash equivalents and investment balances were outside of the us which may be subject to us taxes if repatriated the cash and cash equivalents and investment balances outside of the us are subject to fluctuation based on the settlement of intercompany balances in fiscal year 2015  the increase to cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and longterm investments from the prior year was primarily due to cash provided by operating activities of 6845 million  partially offset by 6069 million of cash required for the repurchase of outstanding common stock under our share repurchase program as of september 30 2015  170  of our cash and cash equivalents and investment balances were outside of the us which may be subject to us taxes if repatriated 

cash provided by operating activities during fiscal year 2016  was 7115 million  compared to 6845 million  in fiscal year 2015  and 5490 million  in fiscal year 2014  cash provided by operating activities resulted primarily from cash generated from net income after adjusting for noncash charges such as stockbased compensation depreciation and amortization charges and changes in operating assets and liabilities 

cash provided by investing activities during fiscal year 2016  was 627 million  compared to cash used in investing activities of 107 million  in fiscal year 2015  and cash provided by investing activities of 1506 million  in fiscal year 2014  cash provided by investing activities for fiscal year 2016  was primarily the result of the sale and maturity of investments partially offset by the purchase of investments and capital expenditures related to maintaining our operations worldwide cash used in investing activities for fiscal year 2015  was primarily the result of the purchase of investments and capital expenditures related to the expansion of our facilities to support our operations worldwide partially offset by the sale and maturity of investments cash provided by investing activities for fiscal year 2014  was primarily the result of the sale and maturity of investments partially offset by the purchase of investments and capital expenditures related to maintaining our operations worldwide and 494 million for the defensenet acquisition 

cash used in financing activities was 6526 million  for fiscal year 2016  compared to 5569 million  for fiscal year 2015  and 6050 million  for fiscal year 2014  cash used in financing activities for fiscal year 2016  included 7001 million  to repurchase common stock under our share repurchase program which was partially offset by cash received from the exercise of employee stock options and stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan of 449 million  and excess tax benefits related to sharebased compensation of 26 million  cash used in financing activities for fiscal year 2015  included 6069 million  to repurchase common stock under our share repurchase program which was partially offset by cash received from the exercise of employee stock options and stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan of 404 million  and excess tax benefits related to sharebased compensation of 95 million  cash used in financing activities for fiscal 2014  included 6505 million  to repurchase common stock under our share repurchase program which was partially offset by cash received from the exercise of employee stock options and stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan of 353 million  and excess tax benefits related to sharebased compensation of 103 million  

based on our current operating and capital expenditure forecasts we believe that our existing cash and investment balances together with cash generated from operations should be sufficient to meet our operating requirements for the next twelve months our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our rate of revenue growth the expansion of our sales and marketing activities the timing and extent of expansion into new territories the timing of introductions of new products and enhancements of existing products and the continuing market acceptance of our products 

obligations and commitments 

the following table summarizes our contractual payment obligations and commitments as of september 30 2016  

  



we lease our facilities under operating leases that expire at various dates through 2025  

as of september 30 2016  we had approximately 146 million  of tax liabilities including interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions see note 5 to our consolidated financial statements because of the high degree of uncertainty regarding the settlement of these liabilities we are unable to estimate the years in which future cash outflows may occur 

purchase obligations are comprised of purchase commitments with our contract manufacturers the agreement with our primary contract manufacturer allows it to procure component inventory on our behalf based on our production forecast we are obligated to purchase component inventory that the contract manufacturer procures in accordance with the forecast unless cancellation is given within applicable lead times

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

tableend interest rate risk our cash equivalents consist of highquality securities as specified in our investment policy guidelines the policy limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue or issuer to a maximum of 5  of the total portfolio with the exception of us treasury and agency securities commercial paper and money market funds which are exempt from size limitation the policy requires investments in securities that mature in three years or less with the average maturity being no greater than one and a half years these securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if interest rates increase a decrease of one percent in the average interest rate would have resulted in a decrease of approximately 66 million  in our interest income for the fiscal year 2016  

  



foreign currency risk the majority of our sales and expenses are denominated in us dollars and as a result we have not experienced significant foreign currency transaction gains and losses to date while we have conducted some transactions in foreign currencies during the fiscal year ended september 30 2016  and expect to continue to do so we do not anticipate that foreign currency transaction gains or losses will be significant at our current level of operations however as we continue to expand our operations internationally transaction gains or losses may become significant in the future we have not engaged in foreign currency hedging to date however we may do so in the future

business 

tableend general 

f5 networks is the leading developer and provider of softwaredefined application services designed to ensure that applications delivered over internet protocol ip networks are secure fast and available to any user anywhere anytime on any device and on any network our core technology is a fullproxy programmable massivelyscalable software platform called tmos traffic management operating system 

introduced in 2004 the tmos platform supports the industry’s broadest array of application services including local and global traffic management network and application security access management web acceleration and a number of other network and application services these services are available as software modules that can run individually or as part of an integrated solution on our highperformance scalable purposebuilt bigip appliances and chassisbased viprion systems or as softwareonly virtual editions that run on all major hypervisors our cloudbased silverline offerings allow customers to subscribe to online denialofservice protection and application security services in conjunction with our bigiq management software the availability of our application services as software on our purposebuilt hardware softwareonly and cloudbased softwareasaservice saas gives customers the flexibility to create a dynamic hybrid infrastructure with consistent policies and centralized management across private and public clouds as well as traditional data centers 

the core features and functions of tmos enable our products to inspect and modify the content of ip traffic flows and sessions between users and applications and support a broad and growing array of services irules a scripting language based 

on tool command language tcl with nodejs addons is a unique feature of tmos that enables customers and third parties to write customized rules to inspect and modify traffic tmos also has an open software interface called icontrol which allows our products to communicate with one another and with thirdparty products and a scripting framework called icall that lets users define data plane events such as threshold breaches and adjust the behavior of our products accordingly tmos is designed to support the addition of new functionality as software modules and to exploit the performanceenhancing features of our purposebuilt hardware 

our hardware products include our bigip family of appliances and our line of scalable viprion systems these purposebuilt devices integrate industrystandard components such as intel based generalpurpose processors high performance cryptographic offload components and fpgas fieldprogrammable gate arrays with specialized hardware offload components we design ourselves the architecture of these systems is designed to accelerate and optimize the performance of our software by offloading repetitive computeintensive functions such as encryption and compression to specific components and enabling complex applicationlayer processing at network speed typically deployed in front of web and application servers our hardware products deliver massive performance and scalability that enable customers to consolidate multiple application services on a single device this consolidation eliminates the need for separate point products which are often difficult and costly to integrate and manage and reduces the load on servers by offloading functions that might otherwise run on the servers themselves offloading functions from servers reduces the number of servers needed to run specific applications lowers the cost of power and cooling and drives down operating costs by simplifying the management of servers and applications in virtual environments this allows customers to increase the density of virtual servers and reduces the added complexity of managing a dynamic environment 

as information technology infrastructures continue to evolve there is growing demand for softwareonly application services that can be deployed in virtual environments next to each instance of an application for customers who prefer this option our virtual edition ve products offer faster throughput than competing products and the broadest array of integrated application services available we sell individual ves of all modules available on our hardwarebased solutions which provide the same software services and include all of the features and functions embedded in tmos 

while ves have lower performance than our hardwarebased solutions they give customers the flexibility to deploy a mix of integrated application services as needed spinning them up and down with each instance of an application and moving them with the application between traditional data centers and private or public clouds both ves and hardwarebased services can be and increasingly are deployed in hybrid infrastructures within data centers and private clouds across multiple data centers and across data centers and public clouds our bigiq management platform supports software modules that enable customers to manage all of the f5 services running in these hybrid environments from a single management console 

in november 2014 we launched our cloudbased silverline saas platform that allows customers to deploy enterprisegrade application services across hybrid environments without upfront investments in it infrastructure and support available by subscription silverline services utilize f5 hardware and software product functionality offer key features from our onpremise application services are highly programmable and include 247 access to experts in our security operations center soc 

in addition to our tmosbased application services our products include our traffix solutions for diameter signaling and routing load balancing and gateway connectivity designed to enable service providers to meet the multiple challenges associated with the growth of mobile data

industry background 

growth and evolution of ipbased infrastructures 

internet protocol ip is a communications language used to deliver applications and data over the internet for more than two decades large business and government organizations have been gradually replacing older data center architectures with ipbased infrastructures deploying new ipbased applications and replacing or upgrading legacy applications with new ipenabled versions this trend has been accompanied by the proliferation of mobile devices such as smartphones tablets and laptops that allow users to access data and applications from almost anywhere at the same time virtualization of data centers and networks and the emergence of public clouds have given rise to dynamic hybrid infrastructures where applications are increasingly hosted offpremise as well as in traditional data centers and can move freely between locations as demand or other circumstances require 

emergence of the dynamic data center and hybrid it infrastructures 

from a broad perspective the goal of it organizations is to optimize the secure delivery of applications to users wherever they are and whenever they need them regardless of where those applications exist server virtualization has enabled organizations to group or partition data center resources to meet user demand and reconfigure these virtual resources easily and quickly as demand changes more recently software defined networks sdn offer organizations ways to reduce costs increase the flexibility and simplify the deployment and management of it infrastructure through network virtualization many organizations are also taking advantage of the growing availability of external cloud resources as a flexible secure and reliable alternative to owning and managing everything themselves as a result it infrastructure has become increasingly dynamic complex and reliant on ipbased networks for the delivery of applications and data at the same time these changes have created new challenges to the security of ip networks and the applications and data accessible over the internet with increasing frequency sophisticated denialofservice attacks have exposed a major vulnerability in the security perimeter of corporate networks by overwhelming firewalls and effectively shutting down the networks in addition many networklevel security threats are directly related to the improper use of the same protocols applications depend on to transmit data intrusion detection and prevention devices which rely on signature databases of known threats afford some protection against these types of attack however they offer no protection against many of the most common threats including information leakage content spoofing crosssite request forgery or “day zero” attacks designed to exploit a variety of application vulnerabilities 

in addition to preventing the threat of attacks designed to disrupt destroy or block access to network applications organizations are faced with the equally daunting challenge of controlling access to applications and data the proliferation of mobile devices has given users with smart phones tablets and laptops the ability to access corporate private and public data centers from virtually anywhere this in turn has increased the difficulty of ensuring that mobile users are able to access applications and data for which they are authorized and that applications and data are protected from access by unauthorized users 

need to optimize the secure delivery of applications and data 

with the ongoing evolution and increasing complexity of it infrastructures there is a growing need to optimize the secure delivery of applications and data over ip networks ipbased traffic passing between enduser devices and servers is divided into discrete packets that travel by multiple routes to their destination where they are reassembled the disassembly routing and reassembly of transmissions are relatively straightforward and require little intelligence by contrast managing inspecting modifying redirecting and securing application traffic going to and from servers requires intelligent systems capable of performing an expanding array of functions broadly speaking all of those functions are aspects of application delivery 

application delivery services dynamically manage secure and optimize the flow of traffic between users and servers physical or virtual freeing up other resources by offloading common network functions such as encryption ipv4ipv6 translation compression authentication rateshaping and a variety of specialized functions including network and application security services policy management and wan optimization that would otherwise have to be coded into applications since most large enterprises have hundreds — if not thousands — of applications it isnt practical to replicate these functions within each instance of an application and maintain consistent policies across a broad spectrum of different applications in traditional data centers it has been common practice to deploy an array of point products in front of server farms to provide various services but that typically requires integrating maintaining and upgrading disparate technologies from different vendors a process that is timeconsuming and expensive in terms of both capital and operating costs from a security standpoint it is also much more difficult to audit traffic passing through multiple devices in such environments a more practical and efficient solution is a comprehensive set of integrated application delivery services on a single highperformance device in virtual and cloud environments where flexibility is a priority software designed to run on standard hypervisors provides the same services and many of the benefits associated with hardwarebased solutions 

although application delivery services are broadly applicable within enterprise and service provider it infrastructures service providers face unique challenges as they attempt to modernize and scale their networks to deal with the flood of data generated by smart phones tablets wearables and other mobile devices to cope with these challenges service providers are migrating legacy 2g3g infrastructures to 4glte networks and evolved packet core epc data centers that require an array of network and application services today most of those services are deployed on separate appliances from different vendors and service providers are actively seeking solutions that will enable them to lower costs and improve reliability and performance by consolidating services and reducing the number of devices increasingly they are also demanding software solutions designed to run on commodity hardware that can be repurposed as needed to cope with the dramatic increase in signaling traffic associated with 4glte networks the challenges of migrating legacy infrastructure and the need to integrate charging and enforcement functions with subscriber data service providers have also adopted the diameter signaling protocol as the de facto standard for communication within their evolving data centers 

f5’s strategy 

our goal is to lead the industry in providing application and network services that ensure the safe fast and reliable delivery of applications to any user anywhere anytime regardless of a users location or where the application resides these services include availability security performance mobility and identity they also include managing and orchestrating resources as well as coordinating services across multiple data centers networks and cloudbased resources our products are designed to be strategic points of control in the it infrastructure that allow business policies to be implemented where information is exchanged key components of our strategy include 

offering a complete integrated suite of application services 

since the introduction of tmos we have developed tmosbased versions of our own legacy products such as local traffic manager ltm bigip dns and link controller new products such as advanced firewall manager afm carrier grade network address translation cgnat and policy enforcement manager pem and products that incorporate acquired technology including application security manager asm application acceleration manager aam access policy manager apm and our enduser protection services websafe and mobilesafe all of these products are currently available as integrated software modules on our bigip and viprion hardware and as virtual editions that run on any standard hypervisor in addition we offer online ddos protection and application security as subscription services on our cloudbased silverline saas platform we believe this approach addresses the needs of todays evolving hybrid infrastructures and sharply differentiates our products from our competitors’ offerings 

investing in technology to meet evolving customer needs 

we continue to invest in research and development efforts that leverage the unique attributes of our tmos platform to deliver new features and functions that address the complex changing needs of our customers although the bulk of our investment is software development concurrent development of tightly integrated highperformance hardware is a key part of our investment strategy we also look for opportunities to acquire technologies that will enable us to broaden the scope of our offerings and expand into adjacent markets 

expanding our addressable market 

since the introduction of tmos we have continually expanded our addressable market and the definition of application delivery through the acquisition and development of new technology in 2003 for example we entered the market for secure remote access through the acquisition of uroam inc and its firepass ssl vpn technology that has become the core of our current access policy manager apm offering the following year we entered the web application firewall market with the acquisition of magnifire websystems inc and its trafficshield security appliance which became the foundation of our application security manager asm in 2013 we introduced advanced firewall manager afm our network firewall and bigiq security a management framework that lets customers administer policies and manage afm across all of their f5 platforms in 2013 we also continued to expand our security solution with the acquisition of versafe a provider of web antifraud antiphishing and antimalware solutions and in 2014 we acquired defensenet a cloudbased ddos protection service that complements our onpremise ddos solution and is currently available on our silverline saas platform while each of these products addresses a different segment of the broader security market they are all integral components of our comprehensive security offering and tightly integrated with ltm and the other features and functions available on our products as a result of this strategy and our development and acquisition of technology in other related markets such as wan optimization java script programming and diameter signaling and routing we believe our current addressable market is significantly larger than the adc market as industry analysts have traditionally defined it 

continuing to build and expand relationships with strategic technology partners 

early on we developed strategic technology partnerships with enterprise software vendors such as microsoft oracle vmware and others who had an established presence in large enterprises by taking advantage of icontrol our open application programming interface and icall a scripting framework that provides the ability to define data plane events such as threshold breaches and adjust the behavior of our products accordingly these vendors were able to equip their applications to control our products in the network enhancing overall application performance in return they provided us significant leverage in the selling process by recommending our products to their customers more recently we have worked closely with several of these vendors to develop configurations of our products called iapps that are specifically designed to simplify deployment and optimize the performance of their applications these solutions are available as templates which allow quick and easy configuration of our products for specific applications 

within the past two years we have developed partnerships with cisco hp microsoft and vmware to provide integrated application services for their software defined networking sdn offerings in addition we have established partnerships with microsoft azure vmware vcloud air amazon web services and many others to provide cloudbased application services and solutions we plan to continue building on our existing relationships and to extend our competitive edge by developing new strategic partnerships with other technology leaders 

leveraging devcentral our online community of network architects and developers 

customization of our tmosbased products using irules enhances their “stickiness” by allowing customers to solve problems in both their applications and their networks that would be difficult if not impossible to solve by other means to promote the use of irules we host an online community devcentral where customers and partners discuss and share the ways in which they use irules to solve problems and enhance the security performance and availability of applications a corollary benefit is that many of the irules solutions posted by devcentral participants have become standard features in new releases of tmos devcentral also provides a valuable window into our customers’ constantly evolving needs that guide our product development 

f5 solutions 

our integrated family of tmosbased network and application services are available as software modules on our purposebuilt hardware as virtual softwareonly editions or ves that run on standard hypervisors and as online services on our silverline saas platform these products function as strategic points of control in ip networks inspecting modifying and directing traffic to optimize the security availability and delivery of applications and data to any user anywhere anytime and on any device our traffix diameter signaling and routing solutions address the complex needs of service providers and complement our tmosbased products by enabling fast reliable communications among the elements of their legacy infrastructures and their evolving packetbased 4glte networks and data centers we believe our products offer the most intelligent services and advanced functionality in the marketplace along with performance and flexibility that enable organizations to simplify management of their ip networks and data center operations by integrating disparate resources to reduce operating costs enhance productivity and improve service to employees customers and partners 

since 2004 we have expanded the breadth of features and functionality we offer well beyond the scope of application delivery networking as it has been traditionally defined today we also offer solutions that include application security secure remote access firewall protection wan optimization access policy management carrier grade network address translation diameter signaling policy enforcement and fraud detection opening up large opportunities in several adjacent markets 

software 

the core of our application delivery technology is tmos our traffic management operating system introduced in september 2004 the fullproxy characteristics of the tmos architecture enable our products to intercept inspect and act on the contents of traffic from virtually every type of ipenabled application in addition the modularity of the tmos architecture allows us to deliver tightly integrated solutions that secure optimize and ensure the availability of applications and the networks they run on 

traffic management operating system tmos 

since tmos was launched we have added thousands of new features designed to interpret and act on specific content in the traffic passing between users and applications tmos includes several features and functions that are unique to our products

product development 

we believe our future success depends on our ability to maintain technology leadership by continuing to improve our products and by developing new products to meet the changing needs of our customers our product development organization which includes product management and marketing employs a standard process for the development documentation and quality control of software and systems that is designed to meet these goals this process includes working with our business development and marketing teams customers and partners to identify new or improved solutions that meet the evolving needs of our addressable markets 

our principal software engineering team is located at our headquarters in seattle washington product development for apm and pem is located in san jose california asm traffix sdc and versafe product development is located in tel aviv israel our hardware engineering team is located in spokane washington san jose and tel aviv in addition we recently opened a dedicated facility for product testing and quality control in warsaw poland 

members of all our product development teams collaborate closely with one another to ensure the interoperability and performance of our hardware and software systems in fiscal year 2015 approximately 93 percent  of our product development organization was engaged in software development 

during the fiscal years ended september 30 2015  2014  and 2013  we had research and product development expenses of 2966 million  2638 million  and 2096 million  respectively 

customers 

our customers include a wide variety of enterprises and service providers among fortune 1000 and business week global 1000 companies including those in technology telecommunications financial services transportation education manufacturing and healthcare along with government customers in fiscal year 2015  sales outside of the americas represented 427  of our net revenues refer to note 9 of our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding our revenues by geographic area 

sales and marketing 

sales 

we sell our products and services to large enterprise customers and service providers through a variety of channels including distributors valueadded resellers vars and systems integrators a substantial amount of our revenue for fiscal year 2015  was derived from these channel sales our sales teams work closely with our channel partners and also sell our products and services directly to major accounts 

f5 sales teams our inside sales team generates and qualifies leads for regional sales managers and helps manage accounts by serving as a liaison between the field and internal corporate resources our field sales personnel are located in major cities in four sales regions the americas primarily the united states europe the middle east and africa emea japan and the asia pacific region apac field sales personnel work closely with our channel partners to assist them as necessary in the sale of our products and services to their customers we also sell our products and services directly to customers primarily large enterprises whose accounts are managed by our major account services team field systems engineers support our regional sales managers and channel partners by participating in joint sales calls and providing presale technical resources as needed 

distributors and vars as a key component of our sales strategy we have established relationships with a number of large national and international distributors local and specialized distributors and vars we derive a majority of our product sales from vars and rely on our large distributors primarily for fulfillment 

our agreements with these channel partners are not exclusive and do not prevent them from selling competitive products these agreements typically have terms of one year with no obligation to renew and typically do not provide for exclusive sales territories or minimum purchase requirements 

for fiscal year 2015  sales to four of our worldwide distributors westcon group inc ingram micro inc avnet technology solutions and arrow ecs represented 176  161  138  and 104  of our total revenues respectively our agreements with these distributors are standard nonexclusive distribution agreements that renew automatically on an annual basis and generally can be terminated by either party with 30 days written notice prior to the start of any renewal term the agreements grant westcon group inc ingram micro inc avnet technology solutions and arrow ecs the right to distribute our products to resellers with no minimum purchase requirements 

systems integrators we also market our products through strategic relationships with systems integrators including dell services hp enterprise services and ibm global services who include our products as core components of application or networkbased solutions they deploy for their customers in most cases systems integrators do not directly purchase our products for resale to their customers instead they typically recommend our products as part of broader solutions such as enterprise resource planning erp or customer relationship management crm solutions that incorporate our products for high availability and enhanced performance 

resellers and technology partners  historically our ability to compete with much larger companies has been strengthened through partnerships with large systems and software vendors currently we partner with dell and hewlettpackard who resell our products and with other large technology companies including microsoft oracle vmware and cisco who recommend our products to their customers management of these relationships is the responsibility of our business development team which closely monitors technology companies in adjacent and complementary markets for opportunities to partner with those whose solutions are complementary to ours and could enable us to expand our addressable market 

marketing 

our marketing strategy is driven by the belief that our continued success depends on our ability to understand and anticipate the dynamic needs of our addressable markets and to develop valuable solutions that meet those needs in line with this belief our marketing organization works directly with customers partners and our product development teams to identify and create innovative solutions to further enhance our leadership position 

to support the growing number of developers using our products including network and application architects we continue to promote and expand devcentral our online community website that provides technical resources to customers prospects and partners wanting to extend and optimize f5 solutions using irules and icall a key aspect of devcentral is an online forum where developers as well as application and network architects discuss and share solutions they have written with irules and icall at the end of fiscal year 2015  devcentral had more than 223000  registered members 

we also engage in a number of marketing programs and initiatives aimed at promoting our brand and creating market awareness of our technology and products these include actively participating in industry trade shows and joint marketing events with channel and technology partners and briefing industry analysts and members of the trade press on our latest products business relationships and technology partnerships in addition we market our products to chief information officers and other information technology professionals through targeted advertising direct mail and highprofile web events 

backlog 

at the end of fiscal years 2015  and 2014  we had product backlog of approximately 381 million  and 616 million  respectively backlog represents orders confirmed with a purchase order for products to be shipped generally within 90 days to customers with approved credit status orders are subject to cancellation rescheduling by customers or product specification changes by customers although we believe that the backlog orders are firm purchase orders may be cancelled by the customer prior to shipment without significant penalty for this reason we believe that our product backlog at any given date is not a reliable indicator of future revenues 

customer service and technical support 

we believe that our ability to provide consistent highquality customer service and technical support is a key factor in attracting and retaining large enterprise customers accordingly we offer a broad range of support services that include installation phone support hardware repair and replacement software updates online tools consulting and training services 

we provide these services directly to end users and also utilize a multitiered support model leveraging the capabilities of our channel partners when applicable our technical support staff is strategically located in regional service centers to support our global customer base 

prior to the installation of our products our services personnel work with customers to analyze their network needs and determine the best way to deploy our products and configure product features and functions to meet those needs our services personnel also provide onsite installation and training services to help customers make optimal use of product features and functions 

our customers typically purchase a oneyear maintenance contract which entitles them to an array of services provided by our technical support team maintenance services provided under the contract include online updates software error correction releases hardware repair and replacement and in the majority of cases roundtheclock call center support free updates of our software are available to customers with a current maintenance contract we also offer an online automated selfhelp customer support function called “ask f5” that provides answers to many commonly asked questions allowing customers to get information and solve problems quickly while significantly reducing the number of calls to our support desk this enables us to provide comprehensive customer support while keeping our supportrelated expenses at a manageable consistent level we also offer an online service called ihealth which allows customers to diagnose uptotheminute snapshots of their bigip systems diagnoses include tailored feedback about configuration issues or code defects a description of the issue recommendations for resolution and a link to further information in the askf5™ knowledge base 

f5 offers training classes for customers on the configuration and use of products including local and wide area network system administration and management we have a complete certification program that qualifies our partners and customers for having the appropriate skills to implement and use the functionality of our products to provide our customers with onsite and remote help we have a professional services team able to provide a full range of feebased consulting services including comprehensive network management documentation and performance analysis and capacity planning to assist in predicting future network requirements 

manufacturing 

we outsource the manufacturing of our preconfigured hardware platforms to third party contract manufacturers for assembly according to our specifications 

our purposebuilt systems are manufactured by flextronics international ltd subcontracting activity at flextronics encompasses prototype builds full production and direct fulfillment flextronics also performs the following activities on our behalf material procurement pcb assembly and test final assembly system test quality control direct shipment and warranty repairs we provide a rolling forecast that allows our contract manufacturers to stock component parts and other materials plan capacity and build finished goods inventory in anticipation of end user demand flextronics procures components in volumes consistent with our forecast assembles the products and tests them according to our specifications products are then shipped to our distributors valueadded resellers or end users generally we do not own the components title to the products transfers from the contract manufacturers to us and then to our customers upon shipment from a designated fulfillment location if the components are unused or the products are not sold within specified periods of time we may incur carrying charges or obsolete material charges for components that our contract manufacturers purchased to build products to meet our forecast or customer orders 

hardware components for our products consist primarily of commodity parts and certain custom components designed and approved by our hardware engineering group most of our components are purchased from sources which we believe are readily available from other suppliers however some components used in the assembly of our products are purchased from a single or limited source 

certain subassembly and testing processes of our products are performed at flextronics facility in zhuhai china the majority of our subassemblies are shipped to flextronics milpitas california plant for configuration and final testing and eventual distribution to our end users we also have capabilities to complete this process for some of our products in flextronics zhuhai china plant for distribution to apac and japan end users 

competition 

the expanding capabilities of our product offerings have enabled us to address a growing array of market opportunities many of which are outside the bounds of the application delivery networking market as defined and measured by industry analysts such as gartner group dell’oro and others in addition to server loadbalancing traffic management and other functions normally associated with application delivery our suite of integrated product modules has expanded our addressable market into security wan optimization application acceleration policy management and diameter signaling and routing where we compete with a growing number of companies not included among traditional adc vendors the ability to create custom network services using irules icontrol and icall has also enabled us our customers and our partners to design solutions to problems for which there is no offtheshelf solution as a result we believe the traditional definitions of our market do not encompass all of the features functions and capabilities of our products or accurately represent the addressable market for those products 

within the more narrowly defined traditional adc market several companies sell server loadbalancing products these include brocade communications systems inc citrix systems inc and a number of smaller competitors radware ltd a10 networks array networks inc and barracuda networks inc 

in related adc markets we compete with the following 

 the principal competitive factors in the markets in which we compete include product features and performance customer support brand recognition the scope of distribution and sales channels and pricing certain of our competitors have employed and may in the future adopt aggressive pricing policies to gain market share however because of the superior 

performance broad functionality and unique capabilities of our products which have resulted in high levels of customer satisfaction and growing brand awareness we believe that we can and will compete effectively against such pricing policies 

intellectual property 

we rely on a combination of patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights we have obtained 254  patents in the united states 21 foreign patents and have applications pending for various aspects of our technology our future success depends in part on our ability to protect our proprietary rights to the technologies used in our principal products despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use trade secrets or other information that we regard as proprietary in addition the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights as fully as do the laws of the united states any issued patent may not preserve our proprietary position and competitors or others may develop technologies similar to or superior to our technology our failure to enforce and protect our intellectual property rights could harm our business operating results and financial condition 

in addition to our own proprietary software we incorporate software licensed from several thirdparty sources into our products these are generally term licenses which may renew annually and that generally provide for certain rights and licenses to support our customers post termination while we may not be able to renew certain of these licenses in the future we believe that alternative technologies for these licenses are available both domestically and internationally 

employees 

as of september 30 2015  we had 4178 fulltime employees including 1087  in product development 1582 in sales and marketing 1078  in professional services and technical support and 431  in accounting and finance administration and operations none of our employees is represented by a labor union we have experienced no work stoppages and believe that our employee relations are good

 item 1a 

risk factors 

tableend in addition to the other information in this report the following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating our company and its business 

our business could be adversely impacted by conditions affecting the information technology market 

a substantial portion of our business depends on the demand for information technology by large enterprise customers and service providers in addition to the challenges presented by new cloud computing models we are dependent upon the overall economic health of our current and prospective customers and the continued growth and evolution of the internet international national regional and local economic conditions such as recessionary economic cycles protracted economic slowdown or further deterioration of the economy could adversely impact demand for our products demand for our products and services depends substantially upon the general demand for application delivery products and associated services which fluctuates based on numerous factors including capital spending levels and growth of our current and prospective customers as well as general economic conditions moreover the purchase of our products is often discretionary and may involve a significant commitment of capital and other resources future economic projections for the information technology sector are 

uncertain as companies continue to reassess their spending for technology projects and embrace new models for delivery of it services such as cloud computing and highly orchestrated software defined networking environments as a result spending priorities for our current and future customers may vary and demand for our products and services may be impacted in addition customer buying patterns are changing over time and more customers seek to rent software on a subscription basis and to reduce their total cost of ownership these evolving business models could lead to changes in demand and licensing strategies which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

cloud based computing trends present competitive and execution risks 

customers are transitioning to a hybrid computing environment utilizing various cloudbased software and services accessed via various smart client devices pricing and delivery models are evolving and our competitors are developing and deploying cloudbased services for customers we are devoting significant resources to develop and deploy our own competing cloudbased software and services strategies while we believe our expertise and investments in software and infrastructure for cloudbased services provides us with a strong foundation to compete it is uncertain whether our strategies will attract the customers or generate the revenue required to be successful in addition to software development costs we are incurring costs to build and maintain infrastructure to support cloudcomputing services these costs may reduce the operating margins we have previously achieved whether we are successful in this new business model depends on our execution in a number of areas including 

 these new business models may reduce our revenues or operating margins and could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

industry consolidation may result in increased competition 

some of our competitors have made acquisitions or entered into partnerships or other strategic relationships to offer a more comprehensive solution than they had previously offered we have also entered into large strategic partnerships to enhance our competitive position in the marketplace as it companies attempt to strengthen or maintain their market positions in the evolving application delivery mobility cloud networking and cloud platform markets these companies continue to seek to deliver comprehensive it solutions to end users and combine enterpriselevel hardware and software solutions that may compete with our solutions and which could negatively impact our partnerships these consolidators or potential consolidators may have significantly greater financial technical and other resources than we do and may be better positioned to acquire and offer complementary products and services the companies resulting from these possible combinations may create more compelling product and service offerings and be able to offer greater pricing flexibility or sales and marketing support for such offerings than we can these heightened competitive pressures could result in a loss of customers or a reduction in our revenues or revenue growth rates all of which could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

we may not be able to compete effectively in the emerging application delivery networking market 

the markets we serve are new rapidly evolving and highly competitive and we expect competition to persist and intensify in the future our principal competitors in the application delivery networking market include brocade communications systems inc citrix systems inc radware ltd and a10 networks in related adc markets we compete with the following 

 16 

we expect to continue to face additional competition as new participants enter our markets as we continue to expand globally we may see new competitors in different geographic regions in addition larger companies with significant resources brand recognition and sales channels may form alliances with or acquire competing application delivery networking solutions from other companies and emerge as significant competitors potential competitors may bundle their products or incorporate an internet traffic management or security component into existing products in a manner that discourages users from purchasing our products any of these circumstances may limit our opportunities for growth and negatively impact our financial performance 

our success depends on our timely development of new products and features market acceptance of new product offerings and proper management of the timing of the life cycle of our products 

the markets for our products and services are characterized by 

 our continued success depends on our ability to identify and develop new products and new features for our existing products to meet the demands of these changes and the acceptance of those products and features by our existing and target customers in addition our products must interoperate with our end customers’ it infrastructure which often have different specifications deploy products from multiple vendors and utilize multiple protocol standards our customers’ it infrastructure is becoming more complex and we may be reliant on orchestration and interoperability with third party vendors on whom we are reliant for testing and support of new product versions and configurations if we are unable to identify develop and deploy new products and new product features on a timely basis our business and results of operations may be harmed 

the current development cycle for our products is on average 1224 months the introduction of new products or product enhancements may shorten the life cycle of our existing products or replace sales of some of our current products thereby offsetting the benefit of even a successful product introduction and may cause customers to defer purchasing our existing products in anticipation of the new products this could harm our operating results by decreasing sales increasing our inventory levels of older products and exposing us to greater risk of product obsolescence we have also experienced and may in the future experience delays in developing and releasing new products and product enhancements this has led to and may in the future lead to delayed sales increased expenses and lower quarterly revenue than anticipated also in the development of our products we have experienced delays in the prototyping of our products which in turn has led to delays in product introductions in addition complexity and difficulties in managing product transitions at the endoflife stage of a product can create excess inventory of components associated with the outgoing product that can lead to increased expenses any or all of the above problems could materially harm our business and results of operations 

our success depends on sales and continued innovation of our application delivery networking product lines 

for the fiscal year ended september 30 2015  we derived approximately 989  of our net product revenues or approximately 511  of our total net revenues from sales of our application delivery networking adn product lines we expect to continue to derive a significant portion of our net revenues from sales of our adn products in the future implementation of our strategy depends upon these products being able to solve critical network availability performance and security problems for our customers and to expand the addressable market for adn products with new features and functionality to address these customer problems and new customer it architectures if our adn products are unable to solve these problems for our customers or if we are unable to sustain the high levels of innovation in our adn product feature set needed to maintain leadership in what will continue to be a competitive market environment our business and results of operations will be harmed 

undetected software or hardware errors or security vulnerabilities may harm our business and results of operations 

our products may contain undetected errors or defects when first introduced or as new versions are released we have experienced these errors or defects in the past in connection with new products and product upgrades as our products and customer it infrastructures become increasingly complex customers may experience unforeseen errors in implementing our 

products into their it environments we expect that these errors or defects will be found from time to time in new or enhanced products after commencement of commercial shipments these problems may cause us to incur significant warranty and repair costs divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts and cause significant customer relations problems we may also be subject to liability claims for damages related to product errors or defects while we carry insurance policies covering this type of liability these policies may not provide sufficient protection should a claim be asserted a material product liability claim may harm our business and results of operations 

our products must successfully operate with products from other vendors as a result when problems occur in a network it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem the occurrence of software or hardware problems whether caused by our products or another vendor’s products may result in the delay or loss of market acceptance of our products the occurrence of any of these problems may harm our business and results of operations 

our products are used to manage critical applications and data for customers and third parties may attempt to exploit security vulnerabilities in our products as well as our internal it systems as we continue to focus on the development and marketing of security solutions we become a bigger target for malicious computer hackers who wish to exploit security vulnerabilities in our products or it systems these problems may cause us to incur significant remediation costs divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts and cause significant customer relations problems adverse publicity related to security vulnerabilities or damage to a customer’s operations due to exploitation of security vulnerability in our products or it systems may harm our business and results of operations 

any errors defects or vulnerabilities in our products or it systems could result in 

 we are dependent on various information technology systems and failures of or interruptions to those systems could harm our business 

many of our business processes depend upon our it systems the systems and processes of third parties and on interfaces with the systems of third parties for example our order entry system provides information to the systems of our contract manufacturers which enables them to build and ship our products if those systems fail or are interrupted or if our ability to connect to or interact with one or more networks is interrupted our processes may function at a diminished level or not at all this would harm our ability to ship products and our financial results may be harmed 

in addition reconfiguring our it systems or other business processes in response to changing business needs may be timeconsuming and costly to the extent this impacted our ability to react timely to specific market or business opportunities our financial results may be harmed 

our failure to adequately protect personal information could have a material adverse effect on our business 

a wide variety of local state national and international laws directives and regulations apply to the collection use retention protection disclosure transfer and other processing of personal data these data protection and privacyrelated laws and regulations continue to evolve and may result in everincreasing regulatory and public scrutiny and escalating levels of enforcement and sanctions and increased costs of compliance certain safeharbor exemptions upon which the company relies for data transfers have been challenged and may no longer available to us in the future our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or to protect such data could result in enforcement action against us including fines imprisonment of company officials and public censure claims for damages by endcustomers and other affected individuals damage to our reputation and loss of goodwill both in relation to existing endcustomers and prospective endcustomers any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations financial performance and business changing definitions of personal data and personal information within the european union the united states and elsewhere especially relating to classification of ip addresses machine identification location data and other information may limit or inhibit our ability to operate or expand 

our business including limiting strategic partnerships that may involve the sharing of data the evolving data protection regulatory environment may require significant management attention and financial resources to analyze and modify our it infrastructure to meet these changing requirements all of which could reduce our operating margins and impact our operating results and financial condition 

our success depends on our key personnel and our ability to hire retain and motivate qualified executives sales and marketing operations product development and professional services personnel 

our success depends in large part on our ability to attract engage retain and integrate qualified executives and other key employees throughout all areas of our business in order to attract and retain executives and other key employees in a competitive marketplace we must provide a competitive compensation package including cash and equitybased compensation if we do not obtain the stockholder approval needed to continue granting equity compensation in a competitive manner our ability to attract retain and motivate executives and key employees could be weakened failure to successfully hire executives and key employees or the loss of any executives and key employees could have a significant impact on our operations in addition we recently announced john mcadams retirement as ceo and the appointment of manuel rivelo as ceo effective july 1 2015 the process of transitioning to a new chief executive could be disruptive to our business and could adversely affect our business and results of operations further changes in our management team may be disruptive to our business and any failure to successfully integrate key new hires or promoted employees could adversely affect our business and results of operations the complexity of our application delivery networking products and their integration into existing networks and ongoing support as well as the sophistication of our sales and marketing effort requires us to retain highly trained developers professional services customer support and sales personnel competition for qualified developers professional services customer support and sales personnel in our industry is intense especially in silicon valley and seattle where we have substantial operations and a need for highly skilled personnel because of the limited number of people available with the necessary technical skills and understanding of our products also to the extent we hire personnel from competitors we may be subject to allegations that they have been improperly solicited that they have divulged proprietary or other confidential information that they have violated noncompete obligations to their prior employers or that their former employers own their inventions or other work product our ability to hire and retain these personnel may be adversely affected by volatility or reductions in the price of our common stock or our ability to get approval from shareholders to offer additional common stock to our employees since these employees are generally granted restricted stock units the loss of services of any of our key personnel the inability to retain and attract qualified personnel in the future or delays in hiring qualified personnel may harm our business and results of operations 

the average selling price of our products may decrease and our costs may increase which may negatively impact gross profits 

it is possible that the average selling prices of our products will decrease in the future in response to competitive pricing pressures increased sales discounts new product introductions by us or our competitors or other factors therefore in order to maintain our gross profits we must develop and introduce new products and product enhancements on a timely basis and continually reduce our product costs our failure to do so will cause our net revenue and gross profits to decline which will harm our business and results of operations in addition we may experience substantial periodtoperiod fluctuations in future operating results due to the erosion of our average selling prices 

our business may be harmed if our contract manufacturers are not able to provide us with adequate supplies of our products or if a single source of hardware assembly is lost or impaired 

we outsource the manufacturing of our hardware platforms to third party contract manufacturers who assemble these hardware platforms to our specifications we have experienced minor delays in shipments from contract manufacturers in the past however if we experience major delays in the future or other problems such as inferior quality and insufficient quantity of product any one or a combination of these factors may harm our business and results of operations the inability of our contract manufacturers to provide us with adequate supplies of our products or the loss of one or more of our contract manufacturers may cause a delay in our ability to fulfill orders while we obtain a replacement manufacturer and may harm our business and results of operations in particular we currently subcontract manufacturing of our application delivery networking products to a single contract manufacturer with whom we do not have a longterm contract if our arrangement with this single source of hardware assembly was terminated or otherwise impaired and we were not able to engage another contract manufacturer in a timely manner our business financial condition and results of operation could be adversely affected 

if the demand for our products grows we will need to increase our raw material and component purchases contract manufacturing capacity and internal test and quality control functions any disruptions in product flow may limit our revenue may harm our competitive position and may result in additional costs or cancellation of orders by our customers 

our business could suffer if there are any interruptions or delays in the supply of hardware components from our thirdparty sources 

we currently purchase several hardware components used in the assembly of our products from a number of single or limited sources lead times for these components vary significantly the unavailability of suitable components any interruption or delay in the supply of any of these hardware components or the inability to procure a similar component from alternate sources at acceptable prices within a reasonable time may delay assembly and sales of our products and hence our revenues and may harm our business and results of operations 

it is difficult to predict our future operating results because we have an unpredictable sales cycle 

our products have a lengthy sales cycle and the timing of our revenue is difficult to predict historically our sales cycle has ranged from approximately two to three months and has tended to lengthen as our products become increasingly complex also as our distribution strategy is focused on a channel model utilizing valueadded resellers distributors and systems integrators the level of variability in the length of sales cycle across transactions has increased and made it more difficult to predict the timing of many of our sales transactions sales of our products require us to educate potential customers in their use and benefits sales of our products are subject to delays from the lengthy internal budgeting approval and competitive evaluation processes that large enterprises and governmental entities may require for example customers frequently begin by evaluating our products on a limited basis and devote time and resources to testing our products before they decide whether or not to purchase customers may also defer orders as a result of anticipated releases of new products or enhancements by our competitors or us as a result our products have an unpredictable sales cycle that contributes to the uncertainty of our future operating results 

we may not be able to sustain or develop new distribution relationships and a reduction or delay in sales to significant distribution partners could hurt our business 

we sell our products and services through multiple distribution channels in the united states and internationally including leading industry distributors valueadded resellers systems integrators service providers and other indirect channel partners we have a limited number of agreements with companies in these channels and we may not be able to increase our number of distribution relationships or maintain our existing relationships recruiting and retaining qualified channel partners and training them in our technologies requires significant time and resources these channel partners may also market sell and support products and services that are competitive with ours and may devote more resources to the marketing sales and support of such competitive products our indirect sales channel structure could subject us to lawsuits potential liability and reputational harm if for example any of our channel partners misrepresent the functionality of our products or services to customers or violate laws or our corporate policies if we are unable to establish or maintain our indirect sales channels our business and results of operations will be harmed in addition four worldwide distributors of our products accounted for 579  of our total net revenue for fiscal year 2015  three worldwide distributors of our products accounted for 459  of our total net revenue for fiscal year 2014  a substantial reduction or delay in sales of our products to these distribution partners if not replaced by sales to other indirect channel partners and distributors could harm our business operating results and financial condition 

a portion of our revenue is generated by sales to government entities which are subject to a number of challenges and risks 

sales to us and foreign federal state and local governmental agency endcustomers account for a significant portion of our revenues and we may in the future increase sales to government entities sales to government entities are subject to a number of risks selling to government entities can be highly competitive expensive and time consuming often requiring significant upfront time and expense without any assurance that these efforts will generate a sale the substantial majority of our sales to date to government entities have been made indirectly through our channel partners government certification requirements for products like ours may change thereby restricting our ability to sell into the federal government sector until we have attained the revised certification government demand and payment for our products and services may be impacted by public sector budgetary cycles and funding authorizations with funding reductions or delays adversely affecting public sector demand for our products and services government entities may have statutory contractual or other legal rights to terminate contracts with our distributors and resellers for convenience or due to a default and any such termination may adversely impact our future operating results governments routinely investigate and audit government contractors’ administrative processes and any unfavorable audit could result in the government refusing to continue buying our products and services a reduction of revenue or fines or civil or criminal liability if the audit uncovers improper or illegal activities which could adversely impact our operating results in a material way finally for purchases by the us government the government may require certain products to be manufactured in the united states and other relatively high cost manufacturing locations and we may not 

manufacture all products in locations that meet the requirements of the us government affecting our ability to sell these products to the us government 

misuse of our products could harm our reputation 

our products may be misused by endcustomers or third parties that obtain access to our products for example our products could be used to censor private access to certain information on the internet such use of our products for censorship could result in negative publicity and damage to our reputation in addition as many of our products are subject to export control regulations diversion of our products to restricted third parties by others could result in investigations penalties fines trade restrictions and negative publicity that could damage our reputation and materially impact our business operating results and financial condition 

our quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate in future periods which may cause our stock price to fluctuate 

our quarterly and annual operating results have varied significantly in the past and could vary significantly in the future which makes it difficult for us to predict our future operating results our operating results may fluctuate due to a variety of factors many of which are outside of our control including the changing and recently volatile us and global economic environment which may cause our stock price to fluctuate in particular we anticipate that the size of customer orders may increase as we continue to focus on larger business accounts a delay in the recognition of revenue even from just one account may have a significant negative impact on our results of operations for a given period in the past a majority of our sales have been realized near the end of a quarter accordingly a delay in an anticipated sale past the end of a particular quarter may negatively impact our results of operations for that quarter or in some cases that fiscal year additionally we have exposure to the credit risks of some of our customers and subtenants although we have programs in place that are designed to monitor and mitigate the associated risk there can be no assurance that such programs will be effective in reducing our credit risks adequately we monitor individual payment capability in granting credit arrangements seek to limit the total credit to amounts we believe our customers can pay and maintain reserves we believe are adequate to cover exposure for potential losses if there is a deterioration of a subtenant’s or a major customer’s creditworthiness or actual defaults are higher than expected future losses if incurred could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our operating results further our operating results may be below the expectations of securities analysts and investors in future quarters or years our failure to meet these expectations will likely harm the market price of our common stock such a decline could occur and has occurred in the past even when we have met our publicly stated revenue andor earnings guidance 

reliance on shipments at the end of the quarter could cause our revenue for the applicable period to fall below expected levels 

as a result of customer buying patterns and the efforts of our sales force and channel partners to meet or exceed their sales objectives we have historically received a substantial portion of sales orders and generated a substantial portion of revenue during the last few weeks of each fiscal quarter in addition any significant interruption in our information technology systems which manage critical functions such as order processing revenue recognition financial forecasts inventory and supply chain management and trade compliance reviews could result in delayed order fulfillment and decreased revenue for that fiscal quarter if expected revenue at the end of any fiscal quarter is delayed for any reason including the failure of anticipated purchase orders to materialize our third party contract manufacturers’ inability to manufacture and ship products prior to fiscal quarterend to fulfill purchase orders received near the end of the fiscal quarter our failure to manage inventory to meet demand our inability to release new products on schedule any failure of our systems related to order review and processing or any delays in shipments based on trade compliance requirements our revenue for that quarter could fall below our expectations resulting in a decline in the trading price of our common stock 

changes in financial accounting standards may cause adverse unexpected revenue fluctuations and affect our reported results of operations 

a change in accounting policies can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective new pronouncements and varying interpretations of existing pronouncements have occurred with frequency and may occur in the future changes to existing rules or changes to the interpretations of existing rules could lead to changes in our accounting practices and such changes could adversely affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business 

we may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities 

our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely affected by nondeductible stockbased compensation changes in the research and development tax credit laws earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and being higher than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates 

transfer pricing adjustments not meeting the terms and conditions of tax holidays or incentives changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in actual results versus our estimates or changes in tax laws regulations accounting principles or interpretations thereof in addition like other companies we may be subject to examination of our income tax returns by the us internal revenue service and other tax authorities while we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes from such examinations and the adequacy of our provision for income taxes there can be no assurance that such provision is sufficient and that a determination by a tax authority will not have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

we are subject to governmental export and import controls that could subject us to liability or impair our ability to compete in international markets 

our products are subject to us export controls and may be exported outside the us only with the required level of export license or through an export license exception because we incorporate encryption technology into our products in addition various countries regulate the import of certain encryption technology and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute our products or our customers’ ability to implement our products in those countries changes in our products or changes in export and import regulations may create delays in the introduction of our products in international markets prevent our customers with international operations from deploying our products throughout their global systems or in some cases prevent the export or import of our products to certain countries altogether any change in export or import regulations or related legislation shift in approach to the enforcement or scope of existing regulations or change in the countries persons or technologies targeted by such regulations could result in decreased use of our products by or in our decreased ability to export or sell our products to existing or potential customers with international operations any decreased use of our products or limitation on our ability to export or sell our products would likely adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property and our products may infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties 

we rely on a combination of patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure of confidential and proprietary information to protect our intellectual property rights despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology monitoring unauthorized use of our products is difficult and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of our technology particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 

our industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the ordinary course of our business we are involved in disputes and licensing discussions with others regarding their claimed proprietary rights and cannot provide assurance that we will always successfully defend ourselves against such claims and such matters are subject to many uncertainties and outcomes are not predictable with assurance we expect that infringement claims may increase as the number of products and competitors in our market increases and overlaps occur also as we have gained greater visibility market exposure and competitive success we face a higher risk of being the subject of intellectual property infringement claims if we are found to infringe the proprietary rights of others or if we otherwise settle such claims we could be compelled to pay damages or royalties and either obtain a license to those intellectual property rights or alter our products so that they no longer infringe upon such proprietary rights any license could be very expensive to obtain or may not be available at all or may require us to make royalty payments which could adversely affect gross margins in future periods the actual liability in any such matters may be materially different from our estimate if any which could result in the need to adjust the liability and record additional expenses similarly changing our products or processes to avoid infringing upon the rights of others may be costly or impractical in addition we have initiated and may in the future initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to determine the scope and validity of our proprietary rights or those of our competitors any of these claims whether claims that we are infringing the proprietary rights of others or vice versa with or without merit may be timeconsuming result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel or require us to cease using infringing technology develop noninfringing technology or enter into royalty or licensing agreements further our license agreements typically require us to indemnify our customers distributors and resellers for infringement actions related to our technology which could cause us to become involved in infringement claims made against our customers distributors or resellers any of the abovedescribed circumstances relating to intellectual property rights disputes could result in our business and results of operations being harmed 

we incorporate open source software into our products although we monitor our use of open source closely the terms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by us courts and there is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products we could also be subject to similar conditions or restrictions should there be any changes in the licensing terms of the open source software 

incorporated into our products in either event we could be required to seek licenses from third parties in order to continue offering our products to reengineer our products or to discontinue the sale of our products in the event reengineering cannot be accomplished on a timely or successful basis any of which could adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

many of our products include intellectual property licensed from third parties in the future it may be necessary to renew licenses for third party intellectual property or obtain new licenses for other technology these third party licenses may not be available to us on acceptable terms if at all the inability to obtain certain licenses or litigation regarding the interpretation or enforcement of license rights and related intellectual property issues could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition furthermore we license some third party intellectual property on a nonexclusive basis and this may limit our ability to protect our intellectual property rights in our products 

our operating results are exposed to risks associated with international commerce 

as our international sales increase our operating results become more exposed to international operating risks additionally our international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks including the following 

 we must hire and train experienced personnel to staff and manage our foreign operations to the extent that we experience difficulties in recruiting training managing and retaining an international staff and specifically staff related to sales management and sales personnel we may experience difficulties in sales productivity in foreign markets we also enter into strategic distributor and reseller relationships with companies in certain international markets where we do not have a local presence if we are not able to maintain successful strategic distributor relationships internationally or recruit additional companies to enter into strategic distributor relationships our future success in these international markets could be limited business practices in the international markets that we serve may differ from those in the united states and may require us in the future to include terms other than our standard terms in customer contracts we intend to continue expanding into international markets sales outside of the americas represented 427  and 431  of our net revenues for the fiscal years ended september 30 2015  and 2014  respectively 

these factors and other factors could harm our ability to gain future international revenues and consequently materially impact our business operating results and financial condition the expansion of our existing international operations and entry into additional international markets will require significant management attention and financial resources our failure to successfully manage our international operations and the associated risks effectively could limit the future growth of our business 

changes in governmental regulations could negatively affect our revenues 

many of our products are subject to various regulations promulgated by the united states and various foreign governments including but not limited to environmental regulations and regulations implementing export license requirements and restrictions on the import or export of some technologies especially encryption technology changes in governmental regulation and our inability or failure to obtain required approvals permits or registrations could harm our international and domestic sales and adversely affect our revenues business and operations 

new regulations related to conflict minerals may force us to incur additional expenses and could limit the supply and increase the costs of certain metals and minerals used in the manufacturing of our products 

in august 2012 the sec adopted new requirements under the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 or the doddfrank act for companies that use certain minerals and derivative metals referred to as conflict minerals regardless of their country of origin in their products whether or not these products are manufactured by third parties the doddfrank act requires companies to perform due diligence and disclose whether or not such minerals originate from the democratic republic of congo or adjoining countries we filed a report on form sd with the sec regarding such matters on may 29 2015 these new requirements could adversely affect the sourcing availability and pricing of minerals or metals used in the manufacture of our products and the numerous components that go into our products all of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results in addition we will incur additional costs to comply with the disclosure requirements including costs related to determining the source of any relevant minerals and metals used in our products we have a complex supply chain and many components are sourced through our contract manufacturer and we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins for these minerals and metals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement as a result we may face reputational challenges with our customers and other stakeholders and possible regulatory risk 

we face litigation risks 

we are a party to lawsuits in the normal course of our business litigation in general and intellectual property and securities litigation in particular can be expensive lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations moreover the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict responding to lawsuits has been and will likely continue to be expensive and timeconsuming for us an unfavorable resolution of these lawsuits could adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

acquisitions present many risks and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that are contemplated at the time of the transaction 

with respect to our past acquisitions as well as any other future acquisitions we may undertake we may find that the acquired businesses products or technologies do not further our business strategy as expected that we paid more than what the assets are later worth or that economic conditions change all of which may generate future impairment charges our acquisitions may be viewed negatively by customers financial markets or investors there may be difficulty integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired business and we may have difficulty retaining the key personnel of the acquired business we may have difficulty in integrating the acquired technologies or products with our existing product lines our ongoing business and management’s attention may be disrupted or diverted by transition or integration issues and the complexity of managing geographically and culturally diverse locations we may have difficulty maintaining uniform standards controls procedures and policies across locations we may experience significant problems or liabilities associated with product quality technology and other matters 

our inability to successfully operate and integrate newlyacquired businesses appropriately effectively and in a timely manner or to retain key personnel of any acquired business could have a material adverse effect on our ability to take advantage of further growth in demand for integrated traffic management and security solutions and other advances in technology as well as on our revenues gross margins and expenses 

antitakeover provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us 

our board of directors has the authority to issue up to 10000000 shares of preferred stock and to determine the price rights preferences privileges and restrictions including voting rights of those shares without any further vote or action by the shareholders the rights of the holders of common stock may be subject to and may be adversely affected by the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future the issuance of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a change of control of our company without further action by our shareholders and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of the holders of common stock further certain provisions of our bylaws including a provision limiting the ability of shareholders to raise matters at a meeting of shareholders without giving advance notice may have the 

effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or management of our company which could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock similarly state antitakeover laws in the state of washington related to corporate takeovers may prevent or delay a change of control of our company 

our stock price could be volatile particularly during times of economic uncertainty and volatility in domestic and international stock markets 

our stock price has been volatile and has fluctuated significantly in the past the trading price of our stock is likely to continue to be volatile and subject to fluctuations in the future some of the factors that could significantly affect the market price of our stock include 

 the stock market in general and the market for technology companies in particular have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations these fluctuations have often been unrelated or disproportionate to operating performance the fluctuations may continue in the future and this could significantly impact the value of our stock and your investment 

we face risks associated with having operations and employees located in israel 

we have offices and employees located in israel as a result political economic and military conditions in israel directly affect our operations the future of peace efforts between israel and its arab neighbors remains uncertain there has been a significant increase in hostilities and political unrest in israel in the past year the effects of these hostilities and violence on the israeli economy and our operations in israel are unclear and we cannot predict the effect on us of further increases in these hostilities or future armed conflict political instability or violence in the region in addition many of our employees in israel are obligated to perform annual reserve duty in the israeli military and are subject to being called for active duty under emergency circumstances we cannot predict the full impact of these conditions on us in the future particularly if emergency circumstances or an escalation in the political situation occurs if many of our employees in israel are called for active duty for a significant period of time our operations and our business could be disrupted and may not be able to function at full capacity current or future tensions and conflicts in the middle east could adversely affect our business operating results financial condition and cash flows 

our business is subject to the risks of earthquakes fire power outages floods and other catastrophic events and to interruption by manmade problems such as terrorism 

a significant natural disaster such as an earthquake a fire a flood or a significant power outage could have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition we have an administrative and product development office and a third party contract manufacturer located in the san francisco bay area a region known for seismic activity in addition natural disasters could affect our supply chain manufacturing vendors or logistics providers’ ability to provide materials and perform services such as manufacturing products or assisting with shipments on a timely basis in the event our or our service providers’ information technology systems or manufacturing or logistics abilities are hindered by any of the events discussed above shipments could be delayed resulting in missed financial targets such as revenue and shipment targets for a particular quarter in addition cyberattacks acts of terrorism or other geopolitical unrest could cause disruptions in our business or the business of our supply chain manufacturers logistics providers partners or endcustomers or the economy as a whole any disruption in the business of our supply chain manufacturers logistics providers partners or endcustomers that impacts sales at the end of a fiscal quarter could have a significant adverse impact on our quarterly results all of the aforementioned risks may be further increased if the disaster recovery plans for us and our suppliers prove to be inadequate to the extent that any of the above should result in delays or cancellations of customer orders or the delay in the manufacture deployment or shipment of our products our business financial condition and operating results would be adversely affected 

in addition to other risks listed in this “risk factors” section factors that may affect our operating results include but are not limited to

our management team monitors and analyzes a number of key performance indicators in order to manage our business and evaluate our financial and operating performance on a consolidated basis those indicators include 

 32 

 critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements 

revenue recognition we sell products through distributors resellers and directly to end users revenue is recognized provided that all of the following criteria have been met 

 revenue from the sale of products is generally recognized when the product has been shipped and the customer is obligated to pay for the product when rights of return are present and we cannot estimate returns revenue is recognized when such rights of return lapse payment terms to domestic customers are generally net 30 days to net 45 days payment terms to international customers range from net 30 days to net 120 days based on normal and customary trade practices in the individual markets we offer extended payment terms to certain customers in which case revenue is recognized when payments are due 

revenues for postcontract customer support pcs are recognized on a straightline basis over the service contract term pcs includes a limited period of telephone support updates repair or replacement of any failed product or component that fails during the term of the agreement bug fixes and rights to upgrades when and if available consulting services are customarily billed at fixed hourly rates plus outofpocket expenses and revenues are recognized when the consulting has been completed training revenue is recognized when the training has been completed 

arrangement consideration is first allocated between software consisting of nonessential and standalone software and nonsoftware deliverables the majority of our products are hardware appliances which contain software essential to the overall functionality of the products hardware appliances are generally sold with pcs and on occasion with consulting andor training services arrangement consideration in such multiple element transactions is allocated to each element based on a fair value hierarchy where the selling price for an element is based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe if available thirdparty evidence tpe if available and vsoe is not available or the best estimate of selling price besp if neither vsoe or tpe is available 

for software deliverables we allocate revenue between multiple elements based on software revenue recognition guidance software revenue recognition guidance requires revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements to be allocated to each element based on the relative fair values of those elements the fair value of an element must be based on vsoe where fair value of delivered elements is not available revenue is recognized on the “residual method” based on the fair value of undelivered elements if evidence of fair value of one or more undelivered elements does not exist all revenue is deferred and recognized at the earlier of the delivery of those elements or the establishment of fair value of the remaining undelivered elements 

we establish vsoe for our products pcs consulting and training services based on the sales price charged for each element when sold separately the sales price is discounted from the applicable list price based on various factors including the type of customer volume of sales geographic region and program level our list prices are generally not fair value as discounts 

may be given based on the factors enumerated above we use historical sales transactions to determine whether vsoe can be established for each of the elements in most instances vsoe of fair value is the sales price of actual standalone unbundled transactions within the past 12 month period when a substantial majority of transactions more than 80 are priced within a narrow range which we have determined to be plus or minus 15 of the median sales price 

we believe that the vsoe of fair value of training and consulting services is represented by the billable rate per hour based on the rates charged to customers when they purchase standalone training or consulting services the price of consulting services is not based on the type of customer volume of sales geographic region or program level 

we are typically not able to determine vsoe or tpe for nonsoftware products tpe is determined based on competitor prices for similar elements when sold separately generally our gotomarket strategy differs from that of other competitive products or services in its markets and our offerings contain a significant level of differentiation such that the comparable pricing of products with similar functionality cannot be obtained furthermore we are unable to reliably determine the selling prices on a standalone basis of similar products offered by our competitors 

when we are unable to establish selling price using vsoe or tpe we use besp in our allocation of arrangement consideration the objective of besp is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a standalone basis we have been able to establish besp through the list price less a discount deemed appropriate to maintain a reasonable gross margin management regularly reviews gross margin information at the consolidated level nonsoftware product besp is determined through our review of historical sales transactions within the past 12 month period additional factors considered in determining an appropriate besp include but are not limited to cost of products pricing practices geographies customer classes and distribution channels 

we regularly validate the vsoe of fair value and besp for elements in its multiple element arrangements we account for taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities on a net basis and excluded these amounts from revenues 

reserve for doubtful accounts estimates are used in determining our allowance for doubtful accounts and are based upon an assessment of selected accounts and as a percentage of our remaining accounts receivable by aging category in determining these percentages we evaluate historical writeoffs current trends in the credit quality of our customer base as well as changes in the credit policies we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition and do not require any collateral if there is deterioration of a major customer’s credit worthiness or actual defaults are higher than our historical experience our allowance for doubtful accounts may not be sufficient 

reserve for product returns in some instances product revenue from distributors is subject to agreements allowing rights of return product returns are estimated based on historical experience and are recorded at the time revenues are recognized accordingly we reduce recognized revenue for estimated future returns at the time revenue is recorded when rights of return are present and we cannot estimate returns revenue is recognized when such rights lapse the estimates for returns are adjusted periodically based upon changes in historical rates of returns and other related factors it is possible that these estimates will change in the future or that the actual amounts could vary from our estimates 

accounting for income taxes we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure including assessing the risks associated with tax audits together with assessing temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities due to the evolving nature and complexity of tax rules combined with the large number of jurisdictions in which we operate it is possible that our estimates of our tax liability could change in the future which may result in additional tax liabilities and adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

stockbased compensation we account for stockbased compensation using the straightline attribution method for recognizing compensation expense over the requisite service period of the related award we recognized 1456 million  and 1272 million  of stockbased compensation expense for the years ended september 30 2015  and 2014  respectively as of september 30 2015  there was 1205 million  of total unrecognized stockbased compensation cost the majority of which will be recognized over the next two  years going forward stockbased compensation expenses may increase as we issue additional equitybased awards to continue to attract and retain key employees 

we issue incentive awards to our employees through stockbased compensation consisting of restricted stock units rsus the value of rsus is determined using the fair value method which in this case is based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock on the date of grant 

we recognize compensation expense for only the portion of rsus that are expected to vest therefore we apply estimated forfeiture rates that are derived from historical employee termination behavior based on historical differences with forfeitures of stockbased awards granted to our executive officers and board of directors versus grants awarded to all other employees we developed separate forfeiture expectations for these two groups 

we recognize compensation costs for awards with performance conditions when we conclude it is probable that the performance condition will be achieved we reassess the probability of vesting at each balance sheet date and adjust compensation costs based on our probability assessment 

common stock repurchase on january 21 2015  we announced that our board of directors authorized an additional 750 million  for our common stock share repurchase program this new authorization is incremental to the existing 16 billion  program initially approved in october 2010 and expanded in each fiscal year acquisitions for the share repurchase programs will be made from time to time in private transactions or open market purchases as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements the programs can be terminated at any time as of november 2 2015  we had repurchased and retired 22974465  shares at an average price of 9037  per share as part of our current repurchase program and we had 4739 million  remaining authorized to purchase shares 

goodwill and intangible assets goodwill represents the excess purchase price over the estimated fair value of net assets acquired as of the acquisition date we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests when impairment indicators are identified goodwill is written down when impaired goodwill was recorded in connection with the acquisition of defensenet inc in fiscal year 2014 versafe ltd and linerate systems inc in fiscal year 2013 traffix systems in fiscal year 2012 acopia networks inc in fiscal year 2007 swan labs inc in fiscal year 2006 magnifire websystems inc in fiscal year 2004 and uroam inc in fiscal year 2003 for our annual goodwill impairment test in all periods to date we have operated under one reporting unit and the fair value of the reporting unit has been determined by the company’s enterprise value we perform our annual goodwill impairment test during the second fiscal quarter 

as part of the annual goodwill impairment test we first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary if as a result of its qualitative assessment it is morelikelythannot ie greater than 50 chance that the fair value of our reporting unit is less than its carrying amount the quantitative impairment test will be required otherwise no further testing will be required 

examples of events and circumstances that might indicate that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount include macroeconomic conditions such as deterioration in the entity’s operating environment or industry or market considerations entityspecific events such as increasing costs declining financial performance or loss of key personnel or other events such as an expectation that a reporting unit will be sold or a sustained decrease in the stock price on either an absolute basis or relative to peers 

if it is determined as a result of the qualitative assessment that it is morelikelythannot that the fair value of our reporting unit is less than its carrying amount the provisions of authoritative guidance require that we perform a twostep impairment test on goodwill the first step of the test identifies whether potential impairment may have occurred while the second step of the test measures the amount of the impairment if any impairment is recognized when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its fair value in march 2015 we completed a qualitative assessment of potential impairment indicators and concluded that it was morelikelythannot that the fair value of our reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount 

acquired inprocess research and development iprd are intangible assets initially recognized at fair value and classified as indefinitelived assets until the successful completion or abandonment of the associated research and development efforts during the development period these assets will not be amortized as charges to earnings instead these assets will be tested for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if impairment indicators are identified 

investments our investments are diversified among highcredit quality debt securities in accordance with our investment policy we classify our investments as availableforsale which are reported at fair market value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss in stockholders’ equity realized gains and losses and declines in value of these investments judged to be other than temporary are included in other income expense to date we have not deemed it necessary to record any charges related to otherthantemporary declines in the estimated fair values of our marketable debt securities however the fair value of our investments is subject to volatility declines in the fair value of our investments judged to be other than temporary could adversely affect our future operating results 

results of operations

provision for income taxes we recorded a 350  provision for income taxes for fiscal year 2015  compared to 374  for fiscal year 2014  and 367  for fiscal year 2013  the decrease in the effective tax rate from fiscal year 2014 to 2015 was primarily due to additional tax benefit recognized during fiscal year 2015 as a result of the reinstatement of the united states federal credit for increasing research activities retroactive to january 1 2014 increase in profitability of certain foreign entities and a reduction in nondeductible compensation expense 

we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized in making these determinations we consider historical and projected taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the appropriateness of a valuation allowance the net increase in the valuation allowance of 29 million  for fiscal year 2015 was primarily related to tax net operating losses incurred in certain foreign jurisdictions and state tax credit carryforwards our net deferred tax assets as of september 30 2015  and 2014  were 557 million  and 431 million  respectively 

our worldwide effective tax rate may fluctuate based on a number of factors including variations in projected taxable income in the various geographic locations in which we operate changes in the valuation of our net deferred tax assets resolution of potential exposures tax positions taken on tax returns filed in the various geographic locations in which we operate and the introduction of new accounting standards or changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof in the various geographic locations in which we operate we have recorded liabilities to address potential tax exposures related to business and income tax positions we have taken that could be challenged by taxing authorities the ultimate resolution of these potential exposures may be greater or less than the liabilities recorded which could result in an adjustment to our future tax expense 

liquidity and capital resources 

we have funded our operations with our cash balances cash generated from operations and proceeds from public offerings of our securities 

  



cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and longterm investments totaled 11720 million  as of september 30 2015  compared to 11283 million  as of september 30 2014  representing a increase of 437 million  the increase was primarily due to cash provided by operating activities of 6845 million  partially offset by 6069 million  of cash required for the repurchase of outstanding common stock under our share repurchase program in fiscal 2015  as of september 30 2015  170  of our cash and cash equivalents and investment balances were outside of the us which may be subject to us taxes if repatriated the cash and cash equivalents and investment balances outside of the us are subject to fluctuation based on the settlement of intercompany balances in fiscal year 2014  the decrease to cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and longterm investments from the prior year was primarily due to 6505 million  of additional cash required for the repurchase of outstanding common stock under our share repurchase program and cash requirements of 494 million  for the purchase of defensenet in the third fiscal quarter which was partially offset by cash provided by operating activities of 5490 million  as of september 30 2014  114  of our cash and cash equivalents and investment balances were outside of the us which may be subject to us taxes if repatriated 

cash provided by operating activities during fiscal year 2015  was 6845 million  compared to 5490 million  in fiscal year 2014  and 4997 million  in fiscal year 2013  cash provided by operating activities resulted primarily from cash generated from net income after adjusting for noncash charges such as stockbased compensation depreciation and amortization charges and changes in operating assets and liabilities 

cash used in investing activities during fiscal year 2015  was 107 million  compared to cash provided by investing activities of 1506 million  in fiscal year 2014  and cash used in investing activities of 3525 million  in fiscal year 2013  cash used in investing activities for fiscal year 2015  was primarily the result of the purchase of investments and capital expenditures related to the expansion of our facilities to support our operations worldwide partially offset by the sale and maturity of investments cash provided by investing activities for fiscal year 2014  was primarily the result of the sale and maturity of investments partially offset by the purchase of investments and capital expenditures related to maintaining our operations worldwide and 494 million  for the defensenet acquisition cash used in investing activities for fiscal year 2013  was primarily the result of the purchase of investments and capital expenditures related to maintaining our operations worldwide and 2126 million  for the acquisitions of linerate systems and versafe partially offset by the sale and maturity of investments 

cash used in financing activities was 5569 million  for fiscal year 2015  compared to 6050 million  for fiscal year 2014  and 1663 million  for fiscal year 2013  cash used in financing activities for fiscal year 2015  included 6069 million  to repurchase common stock under our share repurchase program which was partially offset by cash received from the exercise of employee stock options and stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan of 404 million  and excess tax benefits related to sharebased compensation of 95 million  cash used in financing activities for fiscal year 2014  included 6505 million  to repurchase common stock under our share repurchase program which was partially offset by cash received from the exercise of employee stock options and stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan of 353 million  and excess 

tax benefits related to sharebased compensation of 103 million  cash used in financing activities for fiscal 2013  included 2000 million  to repurchase common stock under our share repurchase program which was partially offset by cash received from the exercise of employee stock options and stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan of 296 million  and excess tax benefits related to sharebased compensation of 41 million  

based on our current operating and capital expenditure forecasts we believe that our existing cash and investment balances together with cash generated from operations should be sufficient to meet our operating requirements for the next twelve months our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our rate of revenue growth the expansion of our sales and marketing activities the timing and extent of expansion into new territories the timing of introductions of new products and enhancements of existing products and the continuing market acceptance of our products 

obligations and commitments 

the following table summarizes our contractual payment obligations and commitments as of september 30 2015

as of september 30 2015  we had approximately 105 million  of tax liabilities including interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions see note 5 to our consolidated financial statements because of the high degree of uncertainty regarding the settlement of these liabilities we are unable to estimate the years in which future cash outflows may occur 

purchase obligations are comprised of purchase commitments with our contract manufacturers the agreement with our primary contract manufacturer allows it to procure component inventory on our behalf based on our production forecast we are obligated to purchase component inventory that the contract manufacturer procures in accordance with the forecast unless cancellation is given within applicable lead times 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in may 2014 the fasb issued asu 201409 revenue from contracts with customers  asu 201409 asu 201409 outlines a new single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance including industryspecific guidance the new model will require revenue recognition to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration a company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services the standard can be applied either retrospectively to each period presented or as a cumulativeeffect adjustment as of the date of adoption in july 2015 the fasb agreed to delay the effective date of asu 201409 by one year in accordance with the agreed upon delay the new standard is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after december 15 2017 early adoption is permitted but not before annual periods beginning after december 15 2016 we are currently assessing the impact that this updated standard will have on our consolidated financial statements and footnote disclosures 

in june 2014 the fasb issued asu 201412 compensation  stock compensation topic 718 accounting for sharebased payments when the terms of an award provide that a performance target could be achieved after the requisite service period  asu 201412 which requires that a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition as such the performance target should not be reflected in estimating the grant date fair value of the award this update further clarifies that compensation cost should be recognized in the period in which it becomes probable that the performance target will be achieved and should represent the compensation cost attributable to the periods for which the requisite service has already been rendered the new standard is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after december 15 2015 early adoption is permitted we do not anticipate that the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

in april 2015 the fasb issued asu 201505 intangiblesgoodwill and otherinternaluse software customer’s accounting for fees paid in a cloud computing arrangement asu 201505 which provides guidance on determining whether a cloud computing arrangement contains a software license if a cloud computing arrangement includes a software 

license then the customer should account for the software license element of the arrangement consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses if a cloud computing arrangement does not include a software license the customer should account for the arrangement as a service contract the new standard is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after december 15 2015 early adoption is permitted we are currently assessing the impact that this updated standard will have on our consolidated financial statements 

in july 2015 the fasb issued asu 201511 simplifying the measurement of inventory asu 201511 which changes the subsequent measurement of inventory from lower of cost or market to lower of cost and net realizable value the new standard is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after december 15 2016 early adoption is permitted we are currently assessing the impact that this updated standard will have on our consolidated financial statements and footnote disclosures

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

tableend interest rate risk our cash equivalents consist of highquality securities as specified in our investment policy guidelines the policy limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue or issuer to a maximum of 5  of the total portfolio with the exception of us treasury and agency securities commercial paper and money market funds which are exempt from size limitation the policy requires investments in securities that mature in three years or less with the average maturity being no greater than one and a half years these securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if interest rates increase a decrease of one percent in the average interest rate would have resulted in a decrease of approximately 56 million  in our interest income for the fiscal year 2015  

  



foreign currency risk the majority of our sales and expenses are denominated in us dollars and as a result we have not experienced significant foreign currency transaction gains and losses to date while we have conducted some transactions in foreign currencies during the fiscal year ended september 30 2015  and expect to continue to do so we do not anticipate that foreign currency transaction gains or losses will be significant at our current level of operations however as we continue to expand our operations internationally transaction gains or losses may become significant in the future we have not engaged in foreign currency hedging to date however we may do so in the future

introduced in 2004 the tmos platform supports the industry’s broadest array of features and functions designed to ensure that applications accessible over internet protocol ip networks are secure fast and available our tmosbased application services include local and global traffic management network and application security access management web acceleration and a number of other network and application services these services are available as software modules that can run individually or as part of an integrated solution on our highperformance scalable purposebuilt bigip appliances and chassisbased viprion systems or as softwareonly virtual editions that run on all major hypervisors in conjunction with our bigiq management software the availability of our products as both hardwarebased and softwareonly solutions gives customers the flexibility to create a dynamic control plane infrastructure tailored to the specific demands of private and public clouds as well as traditional data centers 

the core features and functions of tmos enable our products to inspect and modify the content of ip traffic flows between users and applications and support a broad and growing array of services irules a scripting language based on tool command language tcl is a unique feature of tmos that enables customers and third parties to write customized rules to inspect and modify traffic tmos also has an open software interface called icontrol which allows our products to communicate with one another and with thirdparty products and a scripting framework called icall that lets users define data 

plane events such as threshold breaches and adjust the behavior of our products accordingly tmos is designed to support the addition of new functionality as software modules and to exploit the performanceenhancing features of our purposebuilt hardware 

our hardware products include our bigip family of appliances and our line of scalable viprion systems these purposebuilt devices integrate industrystandard components such as generalpurpose processors and fpgas fieldprogrammable gate arrays with components we design ourselves the architecture of these systems is designed to accelerate and optimize the performance of our software by offloading repetitive computeintensive functions such as encryption and compression to specific components and enabling complex applicationlayer processing at network speed typically deployed in front of web and application servers our hardware products deliver massive performance and scalability that enable customers to consolidate multiple application services on a single device this eliminates the need for separate point products which are often difficult and costly to integrate and manage and reduces the load on servers by offloading functions that might otherwise run on the servers themselves offloading functions from servers reduces the number of servers needed to run specific applications lowers the cost of power and cooling and drives down operating costs by simplifying the management of servers and applications in virtual environments this allows customers to increase the density of virtual servers and reduces the added complexity of managing a dynamic environment 

as information technology infrastructures continue to evolve there is growing demand for softwareonly application services that can be deployed in virtual environments next to each instance of an application for customers who prefer this option our virtual edition ve products offer faster throughput than competing products and the broadest array of integrated application services available we sell individual ve versions of all modules available on our hardwarebased solutions which provide the same software services and include all of the features and functions embedded in tmos 

while ves have lower performance than our hardwarebased solutions they give customers the flexibility to deploy a mix of integrated application services as needed spinning them up and down with each instance of an application and moving them with the application between traditional data centers and private or public clouds both ves and hardwarebased services can be and increasingly are deployed in hybrid infrastructures within data centers and private clouds across multiple data centers and across data centers and public clouds our bigiq management platform supports an array of software modules that enable customers to manage all of the services running in these hybrid environments from a single management console 

in addition to our tmosbased products we offer other closelyrelated products that facilitate enhance or extend our application services 

our traffix family of diameter signaling and routing products acquired in february 2012 offers the most advanced robust and costeffective solution for diameter routing load balancing and gateway connectivity enabling service providers to meet the multiple challenges associated with the growth of mobile data 

linerate softwaredefined application services acquired in early 2013 address the growing demand for network functions virtualization nfv and network service virtualization nsv by enabling application developers and network operators devops to rapidly create and deploy complex networking functions that help scale manage and optimize their applications

industry background 

growth and evolution of ipbased infrastructures 

internet protocol ip is a communications language used to transmit data over the internet for more than two decades large business and government organizations have been gradually replacing older data center architectures with ipbased infrastructures deploying new ipbased applications and replacing or upgrading legacy applications with new ipenabled versions at the same time organizations have become more geographically dispersed and increasingly mobile workforces depend on access to corporate applications and data from remote locations and a variety of client devices including smartphones tablets and laptops 

in recent years the information technology landscape has changed dramatically as organizations have responded to the slowdown in the global economy by using technologies such as virtualization software defined networking and the growing availability and sophistication of cloud computing to reduce capital and operating costs and enhance the flexibility and efficiency of their information infrastructures these efforts are reflected in the ongoing trend toward data center consolidation that includes a reduction in the number and size of data centers as well as the number and variety of hardware devices in addition a growing number of organizations are turning to social networking and other online vehicles to help target customers and compete more effectively in an environment of reduced consumer spending 

emergence of the dynamic data center 

from a broad perspective the goal of it organizations is to optimize the secure delivery of applications to users wherever they are and whenever they need them to achieve these goals it organizations are embracing virtualization technologies that enable them to group or partition data center resources to meet user demand and reconfigure these virtual resources easily and quickly as demand changes the recent surge of interest in software defined networks highlights the latest move to reduce costs increase the flexibility and simplify the deployment and management of it infrastructure through virtualization many organizations are also taking advantage of the growing availability of external cloud resources as a flexible secure and reliable alternative to owning and managing everything themselves as a result it infrastructure has become increasingly dynamic complex and reliant on ipbased networks for the delivery of applications and data at the same time these changes have created new challenges to the security of ip networks and the applications and data accessible over the internet with increasing frequency sophisticated denial of service attacks have exposed a major vulnerability in the security perimeter of corporate networks by overwhelming firewalls and effectively shutting down the networks in addition many networklevel security threats are directly related to the improper use of the same protocols applications depend on to transmit data over the wire intrusion detection and prevention devices which rely on signature databases of known threats afford some protection against these types of attack however they offer no protection against many of the most common threats including information leakage content spoofing crosssite request forgery or “day zero” attacks designed to exploit a variety of application vulnerabilities 

in addition to preventing the threat of attacks designed to disrupt destroy or block access to network applications organizations are faced with the equally daunting challenge of controlling access to applications and data the proliferation of mobile devices has given users with smart phones tablets and laptops the ability to access corporate private and public data centers from virtually anywhere this in turn has increased the difficulty of ensuring that mobile users are able to access applications and data for which they are authorized and that applications and data are protected from access by unauthorized users 

need to optimize the secure delivery of applications and data 

with the ongoing evolution and increasing complexity of it infrastructures there is a growing need to optimize the secure delivery of applications and data over ip networks ipbased traffic passing between enduser devices and servers is divided into discrete packets that travel by multiple routes to their destination where they are reassembled the disassembly routing and reassembly of transmissions are relatively straightforward and require little intelligence by contrast managing inspecting modifying redirecting and securing application traffic going to and from servers requires intelligent systems capable of performing a broad array of functions broadly speaking all of those functions are aspects of application delivery 

application delivery controllers or adcs dynamically manage the flow of traffic between users and servers physical or virtual making multiple servers look like a single resource to the user in addition they free up resources by offloading 

common network functions such as encryption ipv4ipv6 translation compression authentication rateshaping and a variety of specialized functions including network and application security services policy management and wan optimization that would otherwise run on the servers or be coded into applications since most large enterprises have hundreds — if not thousands — of servers and applications it is not practical to replicate these functions on each server or within each virtual instance of an application doing so would take up valuable network resources and reduce the number of applications that could run on each server maintenance costs would be prohibitive and the net result would be a negative impact on the overall performance of servers and applications offloading specific functions onto point solutions can eliminate those problems but introduces a new set of challenges using point solutions from multiple vendors can create interoperability issues and problems that do occur can be difficult to troubleshoot from a security standpoint it is also much more difficult to audit traffic passing through multiple devices providing a comprehensive set of integrated application delivery services on a single highperformance device simplifies management of the device and the servers it sits in front of and reduces overall capital and operating costs in virtual and cloud environments where flexibility is a priority softwareonly adcs provide the same services and many of the benefits associated with hardwarebased adcs 

although application delivery services are broadly applicable within enterprise and service provider it infrastructures the latter face unique challenges as they attempt to modernize and scale their networks to deal with the flood of data generated by smart phones tablets wearables and other mobile devices to cope with these challenges service providers are migrating legacy 2g3g infrastructures to 4glte networks and evolved packet core epc data centers that require an array of network and application services today most of those services are deployed on separate appliances from different vendors apart from the associated capital costs integrating and managing multiple devices entail significant operating expense and service providers are actively seeking solutions that will enable them to lower costs and improve reliability and performance by consolidating services and reducing the number of devices to cope with the dramatic increase in signaling traffic associated with 4glte networks and the multivendor technology interoperability challenges service providers have also adopted the diameter signaling protocol as the de facto standard for communication within their evolving data center infrastructure diameter signaling solutions offer unprecedented scalability reliability and performance on a single carriergrade purposebuilt platform 

f5’s strategy 

our goal is to lead the industry in providing application and network services that ensure the safe fast and reliable delivery of applications to any user anywhere anytime those services include availability security performance mobility and identity they also include managing and orchestrating resources as well as coordinating services across multiple data centers and networks our products are designed to be strategic points of control in the it infrastructure that allow business policies to be implemented where information is exchanged this enables organizations to respond quickly to changing business needs improve costly and time consuming business processes and develop new sources of revenue through highly differentiated offerings key components of our strategy include 

offering a complete integrated application delivery product suite 

since the introduction of tmos we have developed tmosbased versions of our own legacy products such as local traffic manager ltm global traffic manager gtm and link controller new products such as advanced firewall manager afm carrier grade network address translation cgnat and policy enforcement manager pem that leverage the unique performance characteristics of our hardware and software architecture and products that incorporate acquired technology including application security manager asm application acceleration manager aam access policy manager apm and two of our newest security offerings websafe and mobilesafe all of these products are currently available as integrated software modules on our bigip and viprion hardware and as virtual editions that run on any standard server or hypervisor we believe this approach sharply differentiates our products from our competitors’ offerings and provides customers with an expanding array of integrated application delivery solutions that can be customized to meet their specific needs 

investing in technology to meet evolving customer needs 

we continue to invest in research and development to provide our customers with comprehensive integrated application delivery services our product development efforts leverage the unique attributes of our tmos platform to deliver new features and functions that address the complex changing needs of our customers although the bulk of our investment is software development concurrent development of tightly integrated highperformance hardware is a key part of our investment strategy we also look for opportunities to acquire technologies that will enable us to broaden the scope of our offerings and expand into adjacent markets 

expanding our addressable market 

since the introduction of tmos we have continually expanded our addressable market and the definition of application delivery through the acquisition and development of new technology in 2003 for example we entered the market for secure remote access through the acquisition of uroam inc and its firepass ssl vpn technology that has become the core of our current access policy manager apm offering the following year we entered the web application firewall market with the acquisition of magnifire websystems inc and its trafficshield security appliance which became the foundation of our application security manager asm by leveraging the programmability full proxy capabilities and builtin security features of tmos customers were also able to exploit the performance and scalability of our products and deploy them as icsacertified network firewalls in march 2013 we introduced advanced firewall manager afm a new software module that simplifies the deployment and management of our products as network firewalls and bigiq security a management framework that lets customers administer policies and manage afm across all of their f5 platforms in september 2013 we continued to expand our security solution with the acquisition of versafe a provider of web antifraud antiphishing and antimalware solutions and in may 2014 we acquired defensenet which provides cloudbased ddos protection that complements our onpremise ddos solution while each of these products addresses a different segment of the broader security market they are all integral components of our comprehensive security offering and tightly integrated with ltm and the other features and functions available on our products as a result of this strategy and our development and acquisition of technology in other related markets such as wan optimization java script programming and diameter signaling and routing we believe our current addressable market is significantly larger than the adc market as industry analysts have traditionally defined it 

continuing to build and expand relationships with strategic technology partners 

to enhance our competitiveness in large accounts we have developed strategic technology partnerships with enterprise software vendors such as microsoft oracle vmware and others who have an established presence in those accounts by taking advantage of icontrol our open application programming interface and icall a scripting framework that provides the ability to define data plane events such as threshold breaches and adjust the behavior of our products accordingly these vendors can equip their applications to control our products in the network enhancing overall application performance in return they provide us significant leverage in the selling process by recommending our products to their customers we have also worked closely with several of these vendors to develop configurations of our products called iapps that are specifically designed to simplify deployment and optimize the performance of their applications these solutions are available as templates which allow quick and easy configuration of our products for specific applications 

during the past year we have entered into partnerships with cisco hp microsoft and vmware to provide integrated application services for their software defined networking sdn offerings in addition we have established partnerships with microsoft azure vmware vcloud air amazon web services and many others to provide cloudbased application services and solutions we plan to continue building on our existing relationships and to extend our competitive edge by developing new strategic partnerships with other technology leaders 

leveraging devcentral our online community of network architects and developers 

customization of our tmosbased products using irules and our linerate technology with nodejs enhances their “stickiness” by allowing customers to solve problems in both their applications and their networks that would be difficult if not impossible to solve by other means to promote the use of irules and nodejs we host an online community devcentral where network architects and developers can discuss and share the ways in which they use irules and nodejs to solve problems and enhance the security performance and availability of applications a corollary benefit is that many of the irules solutions posted by devcentral participants have become standard features in new releases of tmos devcentral also provides a valuable window into our customers’ constantly evolving needs 

f5 solutions 

our integrated family of tmosbased network and application services is comprised of software products that run on purposebuilt hardware and are also available as virtual softwareonly editions or ves these products function as strategic points of control in ip networks inspecting modifying and directing traffic to optimize the security availability and delivery of applications and data to any user anywhere anytime our linerate technology supports similar functionality in softwareonly solutions designed to meet the specialized needs of softwaredefined data centers our traffix diameter signaling and routing devices address the complex needs of service providers by enabling fast reliable communications among the elements of their legacy infrastructures and their evolving packetbased 4glte networks and data centers we believe our products offer the most intelligent services and advanced functionality in the marketplace along with performance and flexibility that enable organizations to simplify management of their ip networks and data center operations by integrating disparate resources to reduce operating costs enhance productivity and improve service to employees customers and partners

sales and marketing 

sales 

we sell our products and services to large enterprise customers and service providers through a variety of channels including distributors valueadded resellers vars and systems integrators a substantial amount of our revenue for fiscal year 2014  was derived from these channel sales our sales teams work closely with our channel partners and also sell our products and services directly to major accounts 

early in fiscal 2014 we introduced new pricing options for our hardware and software designed to simplify the sales process and provide incentives for customers to purchase more of our software products good better best gbb is a tiered licensing model that is available for our bigip appliances viprion chassis products and virtual editions ves 

 pricing for the modules scales with the size of the system purchased during the last three quarters of fiscal 2014 we saw strong and growing demand for gbb from both our customers and channel partners 

also in early fiscal 2014 we introduced a utility pricing model that allows customers of amazon web services and other public cloud providers to rent ves by the hour or day allowing them to deploy our products on a payastheygo basis 

f5 sales teams our inside sales team generates and qualifies leads for regional sales managers and helps manage accounts by serving as a liaison between the field and internal corporate resources our field sales personnel are located in major cities in four sales regions the americas primarily the united states europe the middle east and africa emea japan and the asia pacific region apac field sales personnel work closely with our channel partners to assist them as necessary in the sale of our products and services to their customers we also sell our products and services directly to customers primarily large enterprises whose accounts are managed by our major account services team field systems engineers support our regional sales managers and channel partners by participating in joint sales calls and providing presale technical resources as needed 

distributors and vars as a key component of our sales strategy we have established relationships with a number of large national and international distributors local and specialized distributors and vars we derive a majority of our product sales from vars and rely on our large distributors primarily for fulfillment 

our agreements with these channel partners are not exclusive and do not prevent them from selling competitive products these agreements typically have terms of one year with no obligation to renew and typically do not provide for exclusive sales territories or minimum purchase requirements 

for fiscal year 2014  sales to three of our worldwide distributors avnet technology solutions ingram micro inc and westcon group inc represented 140  174  and 145  of our total revenues respectively our agreements with these distributors are standard nonexclusive distribution agreements that renew automatically on an annual basis and generally can be terminated by either party with 30 days written notice prior to the start of any renewal term the agreements grant avnet technology solutions ingram micro inc and westcon group inc the right to distribute our products to resellers in north america and certain other territories internationally with no minimum purchase requirements 

systems integrators we also market our products through strategic relationships with systems integrators including dell services hp enterprise services and ibm global services who include our products as core components of application or networkbased solutions they deploy for their customers in most cases systems integrators do not directly purchase our products for resale to their customers instead they typically recommend our products as part of broader solutions such as enterprise resource planning erp or customer relationship management crm solutions that incorporate our products for high availability and enhanced performance 

resellers and technology partners  historically our ability to compete with much larger companies has been strengthened through partnerships with large systems and software vendors currently we partner with dell and hewlettpackard who resell our products and with other large technology companies including microsoft oracle vmware and cisco 

who recommend our products to their customers management of these relationships is the responsibility of our business development team a component of our marketing organization which closely monitors technology companies in adjacent and complementary markets for opportunities to partner with those whose solutions are complementary to ours and could enable us to expand our addressable market 

marketing 

our marketing strategy is driven by the belief that our continued success depends on our ability to understand and anticipate the dynamic needs of our addressable markets and to develop valuable solutions that meet those needs in line with this belief our marketing organization works directly with customers partners and our product development teams to identify and create innovative solutions to further enhance our leadership position 

to support the growing number of developers using our products including network and application architects we continue to promote and expand devcentral our online community website that provides technical resources to customers prospects and partners wanting to extend and optimize f5 solutions using irules and icall a key aspect of devcentral is an online forum where developers as well as application and network architects discuss and share solutions they have written with irules and icall at the end of fiscal year 2014  devcentral had more than 165000  registered members 

we also engage in a number of marketing programs and initiatives aimed at promoting our brand and creating market awareness of our technology and products these include actively participating in industry trade shows and joint marketing events with channel and technology partners and briefing industry analysts and members of the trade press on our latest products business relationships and technology partnerships in addition we market our products to chief information officers and other information technology professionals through targeted advertising direct mail and highprofile web events 

backlog 

at the end of fiscal years 2014  and 2013  we had product backlog of approximately 616 million  and 579 million  respectively backlog represents orders confirmed with a purchase order for products to be shipped generally within 90 days to customers with approved credit status orders are subject to cancellation rescheduling by customers or product specification changes by customers although we believe that the backlog orders are firm purchase orders may be cancelled by the customer prior to shipment without significant penalty for this reason we believe that our product backlog at any given date is not a reliable indicator of future revenues 

customer service and technical support 

we believe that our ability to provide consistent highquality customer service and technical support is a key factor in attracting and retaining large enterprise customers accordingly we offer a broad range of support services that include installation phone support hardware repair and replacement software updates online tools consulting and training services 

we provide these services directly to end users and also utilize a multitiered support model leveraging the capabilities of our channel partners when applicable our technical support staff is strategically located in regional service centers to support our global customer base 

prior to the installation of our products our services personnel work with customers to analyze their network needs and determine the best way to deploy our products and configure product features and functions to meet those needs our services personnel also provide onsite installation and training services to help customers make optimal use of product features and functions 

our customers typically purchase a oneyear maintenance contract which entitles them to an array of services provided by our technical support team maintenance services provided under the contract include online updates software error correction releases hardware repair and replacement and in the majority of cases roundtheclock call center support free updates of our software are available to customers with a current maintenance contract we also offer an online automated selfhelp customer support function called “ask f5” that provides answers to many commonly asked questions allowing customers to get information and solve problems quickly while significantly reducing the number of calls to our support desk this enables us to provide comprehensive customer support while keeping our supportrelated expenses at a manageable consistent level we also offer an online service called ihealth which allows customers to diagnose uptotheminute snapshots of their bigip systems diagnoses include tailored feedback about configuration issues or code defects a description of the issue recommendations for resolution and a link to further information in the askf5™ knowledge base 

f5 offers training classes for customers on the configuration and use of products including local and wide area network system administration and management we have a complete certification program that qualifies our partners and customers for 

having the appropriate skills to implement and use the functionality of our products to provide our customers with onsite and remote help we have a professional services team able to provide a full range of feebased consulting services including comprehensive network management documentation and performance analysis and capacity planning to assist in predicting future network requirements during fiscal year 2014 we increased the relative size or our professional services team in response to increasing customer demand 

manufacturing 

we outsource the manufacturing of our preconfigured hardware platforms to third party contract manufacturers for assembly according to our specifications 

our purposebuilt systems are manufactured by flextronics international ltd subcontracting activity at flextronics encompasses prototype builds full production and direct fulfillment flextronics also performs the following activities on our behalf material procurement pcb assembly and test final assembly system test quality control direct shipment and warranty repairs we provide a rolling forecast that allows our contract manufacturers to stock component parts and other materials plan capacity and build finished goods inventory in anticipation of end user demand flextronics procures components in volumes consistent with our forecast assembles the products and tests them according to our specifications products are then shipped to our distributors valueadded resellers or end users generally we do not own the components title to the products transfers from the contract manufacturers to us and then to our customers upon shipment from a designated fulfillment location if the components are unused or the products are not sold within specified periods of time we may incur carrying charges or obsolete material charges for components that our contract manufacturers purchased to build products to meet our forecast or customer orders 

hardware components for our products consist primarily of commodity parts and certain custom components designed and approved by our hardware engineering group most of our components are purchased from sources which we believe are readily available from other suppliers however some components used in the assembly of our products are purchased from a single or limited source 

certain subassembly and testing processes of our products are performed at flextronics facility in zhuhai china the majority of our subassemblies are shipped to flextronics milpitas california plant for configuration and final testing and eventual distribution to our end users we also have capabilities to complete this process for some of our products in flextronics zhuhai china plant for distribution to apac and japan end users 

competition 

the expanding capabilities of our product offerings have enabled us to address a growing array of market opportunities many of which are outside the bounds of the application delivery networking market as defined and measured by industry analysts such as gartner group dell’oro and others in addition to server loadbalancing traffic management and other functions normally associated with application delivery our suite of integrated product modules has expanded our addressable market into security wan optimization application acceleration policy management and diameter signaling and routing where we compete with a growing number of companies not included among traditional adc vendors the ability to create custom network services using irules icontrol and icall has also enabled us our customers and our partners to design solutions to problems for which there is no offtheshelf solution as a result we believe the traditional definitions of our market do not encompass all of the features functions and capabilities of our products or accurately represent the addressable market for those products 

within the more narrowly defined traditional adc market several companies sell server loadbalancing products these include brocade communications systems inc citrix systems inc and a number of smaller competitors radware ltd a10 networks array networks inc barracuda networks inc and riverbed technology 

in related adc markets we compete with the following 

 14 

 the principal competitive factors in the markets in which we compete include product features and performance customer support brand recognition the scope of distribution and sales channels and pricing certain of our competitors have employed and may in the future adopt aggressive pricing policies to gain market share however because of the superior performance broad functionality and unique capabilities of our products which have resulted in high levels of customer satisfaction and growing brand awareness we believe that we can and will compete effectively against such pricing policies

we rely on a combination of patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights we have obtained 216  patents in the united states 15 foreign patents and have applications pending for various aspects of our technology our future success depends in part on our ability to protect our proprietary rights to the technologies used in our principal products despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use trade secrets or other information that we regard as proprietary in addition the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights as fully as do the laws of the united states any issued patent may not preserve our proprietary position and competitors or others may develop technologies similar to or superior to our technology our failure to enforce and protect our intellectual property rights could harm our business operating results and financial condition 

in addition to our own proprietary software we incorporate software licensed from several thirdparty sources into our products these are generally term licenses which may renew annually and that generally provide for certain rights and licenses to support our customers post termination while we may not be able to renew certain of these licenses in the future we believe that alternative technologies for these licenses are available both domestically and internationally 

employees 

as of september 30 2014  we had 3834 fulltime employees including 1054  in product development 1448 in sales and marketing 945  in professional services and technical support and 387  in accounting and finance administration and operations none of our employees is represented by a labor union we have experienced no work stoppages and believe that our employee relations are good

 item 1a 

risk factors 

tableend in addition to the other information in this report the following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating our company and its business 

our quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate in future periods which may cause our stock price to fluctuate 

our quarterly and annual operating results have varied significantly in the past and could vary significantly in the future which makes it difficult for us to predict our future operating results our operating results may fluctuate due to a variety of factors many of which are outside of our control including the changing and recently volatile us and global economic environment which may cause our stock price to fluctuate in particular we anticipate that the size of customer orders may increase as we continue to focus on larger business accounts a delay in the recognition of revenue even from just one account may have a significant negative impact on our results of operations for a given period in the past a majority of our sales have been realized near the end of a quarter accordingly a delay in an anticipated sale past the end of a particular quarter may negatively impact our results of operations for that quarter or in some cases that fiscal year additionally we have exposure to the credit risks of some of our customers and subtenants although we have programs in place that are designed to monitor and 

mitigate the associated risk there can be no assurance that such programs will be effective in reducing our credit risks adequately we monitor individual payment capability in granting credit arrangements seek to limit the total credit to amounts we believe our customers can pay and maintain reserves we believe are adequate to cover exposure for potential losses if there is a deterioration of a subtenant’s or a major customer’s creditworthiness or actual defaults are higher than expected future losses if incurred could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our operating results further our operating results may be below the expectations of securities analysts and investors in future quarters or years our failure to meet these expectations will likely harm the market price of our common stock such a decline could occur and has occurred in the past even when we have met our publicly stated revenue andor earnings guidance 

our stock price could be volatile particularly during times of economic uncertainty and volatility in domestic and international stock markets 

our stock price has been volatile and has fluctuated significantly in the past the trading price of our stock is likely to continue to be volatile and subject to fluctuations in the future some of the factors that could significantly affect the market price of our stock include 

 the stock market in general and the market for technology companies in particular have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations these fluctuations have often been unrelated or disproportionate to operating performance the fluctuations may continue in the future and this could significantly impact the value of our stock and your investment 

cloud based computing trends present competitive and execution risks 

customers are transitioning to a hybrid computing environment utilizing various cloudbased software and services accessed via various smart client devices pricing and delivery models are evolving and our competitors are developing and deploying cloudbased services for customers we are devoting significant resources to develop and deploy our own competing cloudbased software and services strategies while we believe our expertise and investments in software and infrastructure for cloudbased services provides us with a strong foundation to compete it is uncertain whether our strategies will attract the customers or generate the revenue required to be successful in addition to software development costs we are incurring costs to build and maintain infrastructure to support cloudcomputing services these costs may reduce the operating margins we have previously achieved whether we are successful in this new business model depends on our execution in a number of areas including 

 these new business models may reduce our revenues or operating margins and could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our business could be adversely impacted by conditions affecting the information technology market 

a substantial portion of our business depends on the demand for information technology by large enterprise customers and service providers in addition to the challenges presented by new cloud computing models we are dependent upon the overall economic health of our current and prospective customers and the continued growth and evolution of the internet international national regional and local economic conditions such as recessionary economic cycles protracted economic slowdown or further deterioration of the economy could adversely impact demand for our products demand for our products and services depends substantially upon the general demand for application delivery products and associated services which fluctuates based on numerous factors including capital spending levels and growth of our current and prospective customers as well as general economic conditions moreover the purchase of our products is often discretionary and may involve a significant commitment of capital and other resources future economic projections for the information technology sector are uncertain as companies continue to reassess their spending for technology projects and embrace new models for delivery of it 

services such as cloud computing as a result spending priorities for our current and future customers may vary and demand for our products and services may be impacted in addition customer buying patterns are changing over time and more customers seek to rent software on a subscription basis these evolving business models could lead to changes in demand and licensing strategies which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

industry consolidation may result in increased competition 

some of our competitors have made acquisitions or entered into partnerships or other strategic relationships to offer a more comprehensive solution than they had previously offered we have also entered into large strategic partnerships to enhance our competitive position in the marketplace as it companies attempt to strengthen or maintain their market positions in the evolving application delivery mobility cloud networking and cloud platform markets these companies continue to seek to deliver comprehensive it solutions to end users and combine enterpriselevel hardware and software solutions that may compete with our solutions and which could negatively impact our partnerships these consolidators or potential consolidators may have significantly greater financial technical and other resources than we do and may be better positioned to acquire and offer complementary products and services the companies resulting from these possible combinations may create more compelling product and service offerings and be able to offer greater pricing flexibility or sales and marketing support for such offerings than we can these heightened competitive pressures could result in a loss of customers or a reduction in our revenues or revenue growth rates all of which could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

in addition to other risks listed in this “risk factors” section factors that may affect our operating results include but are not limited to 

 our success depends on our timely development of new products and features market acceptance of new product offerings and proper management of the timing of the life cycle of our products 

the markets for our products and services are characterized by 

 18 

 our continued success depends on our ability to identify and develop new products and new features for our existing products to meet the demands of these changes and the acceptance of those products and features by our existing and target customers if we are unable to identify develop and deploy new products and new product features on a timely basis our business and results of operations may be harmed 

the current development cycle for our products is on average 1224 months the introduction of new products or product enhancements may shorten the life cycle of our existing products or replace sales of some of our current products thereby offsetting the benefit of even a successful product introduction and may cause customers to defer purchasing our existing products in anticipation of the new products this could harm our operating results by decreasing sales increasing our inventory levels of older products and exposing us to greater risk of product obsolescence we have also experienced and may in the future experience delays in developing and releasing new products and product enhancements this has led to and may in the future lead to delayed sales increased expenses and lower quarterly revenue than anticipated also in the development of our products we have experienced delays in the prototyping of our products which in turn has led to delays in product introductions in addition complexity and difficulties in managing product transitions at the endoflife stage of a product can create excess inventory of components associated with the outgoing product that can lead to increased expenses any or all of the above problems could materially harm our business and results of operations 

our success depends on sales and continued innovation of our application delivery networking product lines 

for the fiscal year ended september 30 2014  we derived approximately 981  of our net product revenues or approximately 530  of our total net revenues from sales of our application delivery networking adn product lines we expect to continue to derive a significant portion of our net revenues from sales of our adn products in the future implementation of our strategy depends upon these products being able to solve critical network availability performance and security problems for our customers if our adn products are unable to solve these problems for our customers or if we are unable to sustain the high levels of innovation in our adn product feature set needed to maintain leadership in what will continue to be a competitive market environment our business and results of operations will be harmed 

we may not be able to compete effectively in the emerging application delivery networking market 

the markets we serve are new rapidly evolving and highly competitive and we expect competition to persist and intensify in the future our principal competitors in the application delivery networking market include brocade communications systems inc citrix systems inc radware ltd and a10 networks in related adc markets we compete with the following 

 we expect to continue to face additional competition as new participants enter our markets as we continue to expand globally we may see new competitors in different geographic regions in addition larger companies with significant resources brand recognition and sales channels may form alliances with or acquire competing application delivery networking solutions from other companies and emerge as significant competitors potential competitors may bundle their products or incorporate an internet traffic management or security component into existing products in a manner that discourages users from purchasing our products any of these circumstances may limit our opportunities for growth and negatively impact our financial performance 

the average selling price of our products may decrease and our costs may increase which may negatively impact gross profits 

it is possible that the average selling prices of our products will decrease in the future in response to competitive pricing pressures increased sales discounts new product introductions by us or our competitors or other factors therefore in order to maintain our gross profits we must develop and introduce new products and product enhancements on a timely basis and continually reduce our product costs our failure to do so will cause our net revenue and gross profits to decline which will harm our business and results of operations in addition we may experience substantial periodtoperiod fluctuations in future operating results due to the erosion of our average selling prices 

it is difficult to predict our future operating results because we have an unpredictable sales cycle 

our products have a lengthy sales cycle and the timing of our revenue is difficult to predict historically our sales cycle has ranged from approximately two to three months and has tended to lengthen as we have increasingly focused our sales efforts on the enterprise market also as our distribution strategy is focused on a channel model utilizing valueadded resellers distributors and systems integrators the level of variability in the length of sales cycle across transactions has increased and made it more difficult to predict the timing of many of our sales transactions sales of our products require us to educate potential customers in their use and benefits sales of our products are subject to delays from the lengthy internal budgeting approval and competitive evaluation processes that large enterprises and governmental entities may require for example customers frequently begin by evaluating our products on a limited basis and devote time and resources to testing our products before they decide whether or not to purchase customers may also defer orders as a result of anticipated releases of new products or enhancements by our competitors or us as a result our products have an unpredictable sales cycle that contributes to the uncertainty of our future operating results 

our business may be harmed if our contract manufacturers are not able to provide us with adequate supplies of our products or if a single source of hardware assembly is lost or impaired 

we outsource the manufacturing of our hardware platforms to third party contract manufacturers who assemble these hardware platforms to our specifications we have experienced minor delays in shipments from contract manufacturers in the past however if we experience major delays in the future or other problems such as inferior quality and insufficient quantity of product any one or a combination of these factors may harm our business and results of operations the inability of our contract manufacturers to provide us with adequate supplies of our products or the loss of one or more of our contract manufacturers may cause a delay in our ability to fulfill orders while we obtain a replacement manufacturer and may harm our business and results of operations in particular we currently subcontract manufacturing of our application delivery networking products to a single contract manufacturer with whom we do not have a longterm contract if our arrangement with this single source of hardware assembly was terminated or otherwise impaired and we were not able to engage another contract manufacturer in a timely manner our business financial condition and results of operation could be adversely affected 

if the demand for our products grows we will need to increase our raw material and component purchases contract manufacturing capacity and internal test and quality control functions any disruptions in product flow may limit our revenue may harm our competitive position and may result in additional costs or cancellation of orders by our customers 

our business could suffer if there are any interruptions or delays in the supply of hardware components from our thirdparty sources 

we currently purchase several hardware components used in the assembly of our products from a number of single or limited sources lead times for these components vary significantly the unavailability of suitable components any interruption or delay in the supply of any of these hardware components or the inability to procure a similar component from alternate sources at acceptable prices within a reasonable time may delay assembly and sales of our products and hence our revenues and may harm our business and results of operations 

we are subject to governmental export and import controls that could subject us to liability or impair our ability to compete in international markets 

our products are subject to us export controls and may be exported outside the us only with the required level of export license or through an export license exception because we incorporate encryption technology into our products in addition various countries regulate the import of certain encryption technology and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute our products or our customers’ ability to implement our products in those countries changes in our products or changes in export and import regulations may create delays in the introduction of our products in international markets prevent our customers with international operations from deploying our products throughout their global systems or in some cases prevent the export or import of our products to certain countries altogether any change in export or import 

regulations or related legislation shift in approach to the enforcement or scope of existing regulations or change in the countries persons or technologies targeted by such regulations could result in decreased use of our products by or in our decreased ability to export or sell our products to existing or potential customers with international operations any decreased use of our products or limitation on our ability to export or sell our products would likely adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

reliance on shipments at the end of the quarter could cause our revenue for the applicable period to fall below expected levels 

as a result of customer buying patterns and the efforts of our sales force and channel partners to meet or exceed their sales objectives we have historically received a substantial portion of sales orders and generated a substantial portion of revenue during the last few weeks of each fiscal quarter in addition any significant interruption in our information technology systems which manage critical functions such as order processing revenue recognition financial forecasts inventory and supply chain management and trade compliance reviews could result in delayed order fulfillment and decreased revenue for that fiscal quarter if expected revenue at the end of any fiscal quarter is delayed for any reason including the failure of anticipated purchase orders to materialize our third party contract manufacturers’ inability to manufacture and ship products prior to fiscal quarterend to fulfill purchase orders received near the end of the fiscal quarter our failure to manage inventory to meet demand our inability to release new products on schedule any failure of our systems related to order review and processing or any delays in shipments based on trade compliance requirements our revenue for that quarter could fall below our expectations resulting in a decline in the trading price of our common stock 

we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property and our products may infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties 

we rely on a combination of patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure of confidential and proprietary information to protect our intellectual property rights despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology monitoring unauthorized use of our products is difficult and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of our technology particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 

our industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the ordinary course of our business we are involved in disputes and licensing discussions with others regarding their claimed proprietary rights and cannot provide assurance that we will always successfully defend ourselves against such claims we expect that infringement claims may increase as the number of products and competitors in our market increases and overlaps occur also as we have gained greater visibility market exposure and competitive success we face a higher risk of being the subject of intellectual property infringement claims if we are found to infringe the proprietary rights of others or if we otherwise settle such claims we could be compelled to pay damages or royalties and either obtain a license to those intellectual property rights or alter our products so that they no longer infringe upon such proprietary rights any license could be very expensive to obtain or may not be available at all similarly changing our products or processes to avoid infringing upon the rights of others may be costly or impractical in addition we have initiated and may in the future initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to determine the scope and validity of our proprietary rights or those of our competitors any of these claims whether claims that we are infringing the proprietary rights of others or vice versa with or without merit may be timeconsuming result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel or require us to cease using infringing technology develop noninfringing technology or enter into royalty or licensing agreements further our license agreements typically require us to indemnify our customers distributors and resellers for infringement actions related to our technology which could cause us to become involved in infringement claims made against our customers distributors or resellers any of the abovedescribed circumstances relating to intellectual property rights disputes could result in our business and results of operations being harmed 

we incorporate open source software into our products although we monitor our use of open source closely the terms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by us courts and there is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products we could also be subject to similar conditions or restrictions should there be any changes in the licensing terms of the open source software incorporated into our products in either event we could be required to seek licenses from third parties in order to continue offering our products to reengineer our products or to discontinue the sale of our products in the event reengineering cannot be accomplished on a timely or successful basis any of which could adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

many of our products include intellectual property licensed from third parties in the future it may be necessary to renew licenses for third party intellectual property or obtain new licenses for other technology these third party licenses may not be available to us on acceptable terms if at all the inability to obtain certain licenses or litigation regarding the interpretation or enforcement of license rights and related intellectual property issues could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition furthermore we license some third party intellectual property on a nonexclusive basis and this may limit our ability to protect our intellectual property rights in our products 

we may not be able to sustain or develop new distribution relationships and a reduction or delay in sales to significant distribution partners could hurt our business 

we sell our products and services through multiple distribution channels in the united states and internationally including leading industry distributors valueadded resellers systems integrators service providers and other indirect channel partners we have a limited number of agreements with companies in these channels and we may not be able to increase our number of distribution relationships or maintain our existing relationships recruiting and retaining qualified channel partners and training them in our technologies requires significant time and resources these channel partners may also market sell and support products and services that are competitive with ours and may devote more resources to the marketing sales and support of such competitive products our indirect sales channel structure could subject us to lawsuits potential liability and reputational harm if for example any of our channel partners misrepresent the functionality of our products or services to customers or violate laws or our corporate policies if we are unable to establish or maintain our indirect sales channels our business and results of operations will be harmed in addition three worldwide distributors of our products accounted for 459  of our total net revenue for fiscal year 2014  three worldwide distributors of our products accounted for 441  of our total net revenue for fiscal year 2013  a substantial reduction or delay in sales of our products to these distribution partners if not replaced by sales to other indirect channel partners and distributors could harm our business operating results and financial condition 

undetected software or hardware errors or security vulnerabilities may harm our business and results of operations 

our products may contain undetected errors or defects when first introduced or as new versions are released we have experienced these errors or defects in the past in connection with new products and product upgrades we expect that these errors or defects will be found from time to time in new or enhanced products after commencement of commercial shipments these problems may cause us to incur significant warranty and repair costs divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts and cause significant customer relations problems we may also be subject to liability claims for damages related to product errors or defects while we carry insurance policies covering this type of liability these policies may not provide sufficient protection should a claim be asserted a material product liability claim may harm our business and results of operations 

our products must successfully operate with products from other vendors as a result when problems occur in a network it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem the occurrence of software or hardware problems whether caused by our products or another vendor’s products may result in the delay or loss of market acceptance of our products the occurrence of any of these problems may harm our business and results of operations 

our products are used to manage critical applications and data for customers and third parties may attempt to exploit security vulnerabilities in our products as we continue to focus on the development and marketing of security solutions we become a bigger target for malicious computer hackers who wish to exploit security vulnerabilities in our products these problems may cause us to incur significant remediation costs divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts and cause significant customer relations problems adverse publicity related to security vulnerabilities or damage to a customer’s operations due to exploitation of security vulnerability in our products may harm our business and results of operations 

any errors defects or vulnerabilities in our products could result in 

 22 

 we are dependent on various information technology systems and failures of or interruptions to those systems could harm our business 

many of our business processes depend upon our it systems the systems and processes of third parties and on interfaces with the systems of third parties for example our order entry system provides information to the systems of our contract manufacturers which enables them to build and ship our products if those systems fail or are interrupted or if our ability to connect to or interact with one or more networks is interrupted our processes may function at a diminished level or not at all this would harm our ability to ship products and our financial results may be harmed 

in addition reconfiguring our it systems or other business processes in response to changing business needs may be timeconsuming and costly to the extent this impacted our ability to react timely to specific market or business opportunities our financial results may be harmed 

our operating results are exposed to risks associated with international commerce 

as our international sales increase our operating results become more exposed to international operating risks additionally our international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks including the following 

 we must hire and train experienced personnel to staff and manage our foreign operations to the extent that we experience difficulties in recruiting training managing and retaining an international staff and specifically staff related to sales management and sales personnel we may experience difficulties in sales productivity in foreign markets we also enter into strategic distributor and reseller relationships with companies in certain international markets where we do not have a local presence if we are not able to maintain successful strategic distributor relationships internationally or recruit additional companies to enter into strategic distributor relationships our future success in these international markets could be limited business practices in the international markets that we serve may differ from those in the united states and may require us in the future to include terms other than our standard terms in customer contracts we intend to continue expanding into international markets sales outside of the americas represented 431  and 425  of our net revenues for the fiscal years ended september 30 2014  and 2013  respectively 

these factors and other factors could harm our ability to gain future international revenues and consequently materially impact our business operating results and financial condition the expansion of our existing international operations and entry into additional international markets will require significant management attention and financial resources our failure to successfully manage our international operations and the associated risks effectively could limit the future growth of our business 

a portion of our revenue is generated by sales to government entities which are subject to a number of challenges and risks 

sales to us and foreign federal state and local governmental agency endcustomers account for a significant portion of our revenues and we may in the future increase sales to government entities sales to government entities are subject to a number of risks selling to government entities can be highly competitive expensive and time consuming often requiring significant upfront time and expense without any assurance that these efforts will generate a sale the substantial majority of our sales to date to government entities have been made indirectly through our channel partners government certification requirements for products like ours may change thereby restricting our ability to sell into the federal government sector until we have attained the revised certification government demand and payment for our products and services may be impacted by public sector budgetary cycles and funding authorizations with funding reductions or delays adversely affecting public sector demand for our products and services government entities may have statutory contractual or other legal rights to terminate contracts with our distributors and resellers for convenience or due to a default and any such termination may adversely impact our future operating results governments routinely investigate and audit government contractors’ administrative processes and any unfavorable audit could result in the government refusing to continue buying our products and services a reduction of revenue or fines or civil or criminal liability if the audit uncovers improper or illegal activities which could adversely impact our operating results in a material way finally for purchases by the us government the government may require certain products to be manufactured in the united states and other relatively high cost manufacturing locations and we may not manufacture all products in locations that meet the requirements of the us government affecting our ability to sell these products to the us government 

our failure to adequately protect personal information could have a material adverse effect on our business 

a wide variety of local state national and international laws directives and regulations apply to the collection use retention protection disclosure transfer and other processing of personal data these data protection and privacyrelated laws and regulations continue to evolve and may result in everincreasing regulatory and public scrutiny and escalating levels of enforcement and sanctions and increased costs of compliance our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or to protect such data could result in enforcement action against us including fines imprisonment of company officials and public censure claims for damages by endcustomers and other affected individuals damage to our reputation and loss of goodwill both in relation to existing endcustomers and prospective endcustomers any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations financial performance and business changing definitions of personal data and personal information within the european union the united states and elsewhere especially relating to classification of ip addresses machine identification location data and other information may limit or inhibit our ability to operate or expand our business including limiting strategic partnerships that may involve the sharing of data 

misuse of our products could harm our reputation 

our products may be misused by endcustomers or third parties that obtain access to our products for example our products could be used to censor private access to certain information on the internet such use of our products for censorship could result in negative publicity and damage to our reputation in addition as many of our products are subject to export control regulations diversion of our products to restricted third parties by others could result in investigations penalties fines trade restrictions and negative publicity that could damage our reputation and materially impact our business operating results and financial condition 

changes in governmental regulations could negatively affect our revenues 

many of our products are subject to various regulations promulgated by the united states and various foreign governments including but not limited to environmental regulations and regulations implementing export license requirements and restrictions on the import or export of some technologies especially encryption technology changes in governmental regulation and our inability or failure to obtain required approvals permits or registrations could harm our international and domestic sales and adversely affect our revenues business and operations 

new regulations related to conflict minerals may force us to incur additional expenses and could limit the supply and increase the costs of certain metals and minerals used in the manufacturing of our products 

in august 2012 the sec adopted new requirements under the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 or the doddfrank act for companies that use certain minerals and derivative metals referred to as conflict minerals regardless of their country of origin in their products whether or not these products are manufactured by third parties the doddfrank act requires companies to perform due diligence and disclose whether or not such minerals originate from the democratic republic of congo or adjoining countries we filed a report on form sd with the sec regarding such matters on may 30 2014 and are required to file on an annual basis going forward these new requirements could adversely 

affect the sourcing availability and pricing of minerals or metals used in the manufacture of our products and the numerous components that go into our products all of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results in addition we will incur additional costs to comply with the disclosure requirements including costs related to determining the source of any relevant minerals and metals used in our products we have a complex supply chain and many components are sourced through our contract manufacturer and we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins for these minerals and metals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement as a result we may face reputational challenges with our customers and other stakeholders and possible regulatory risk 

changes in financial accounting standards may cause adverse unexpected revenue fluctuations and affect our reported results of operations 

a change in accounting policies can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective new pronouncements and varying interpretations of existing pronouncements have occurred with frequency and may occur in the future changes to existing rules or changes to the interpretations of existing rules could lead to changes in our accounting practices and such changes could adversely affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business 

we may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities 

our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely affected by nondeductible stockbased compensation changes in the research and development tax credit laws earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and being higher than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates transfer pricing adjustments not meeting the terms and conditions of tax holidays or incentives changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in actual results versus our estimates or changes in tax laws regulations accounting principles or interpretations thereof in addition like other companies we may be subject to examination of our income tax returns by the us internal revenue service and other tax authorities while we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes from such examinations and the adequacy of our provision for income taxes there can be no assurance that such provision is sufficient and that a determination by a tax authority will not have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

acquisitions present many risks and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that are contemplated at the time of the transaction 

with respect to our past acquisitions as well as any other future acquisitions we may undertake we may find that the acquired businesses products or technologies do not further our business strategy as expected that we paid more than what the assets are later worth or that economic conditions change all of which may generate future impairment charges our acquisitions may be viewed negatively by customers financial markets or investors there may be difficulty integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired business and we may have difficulty retaining the key personnel of the acquired business we may have difficulty in integrating the acquired technologies or products with our existing product lines our ongoing business and management’s attention may be disrupted or diverted by transition or integration issues and the complexity of managing geographically and culturally diverse locations we may have difficulty maintaining uniform standards controls procedures and policies across locations we may experience significant problems or liabilities associated with product quality technology and other matters 

our inability to successfully operate and integrate newlyacquired businesses appropriately effectively and in a timely manner or to retain key personnel of any acquired business could have a material adverse effect on our ability to take advantage of further growth in demand for integrated traffic management and security solutions and other advances in technology as well as on our revenues gross margins and expenses 

our success depends on our key personnel and our ability to hire retain and motivate qualified executives sales and marketing operations product development and professional services personnel 

our success depends in large part on our ability to attract engage retain and integrate qualified executives and other key employees throughout all areas of our business in order to attract and retain executives and other key employees in a competitive marketplace we must provide a competitive compensation package including cash and equitybased compensation if we do not obtain the stockholder approval needed to continue granting equity compensation in a competitive manner our ability to attract retain and motivate executives and key employees could be weakened failure to successfully hire executives and key employees or the loss of any executives and key employees could have a significant impact on our operations in addition our ceo recently announced his intended retirement at the end of fiscal year 2015 the process of identifying his successor could be disruptive to our business and the failure to identify and hire his successor in a timely manner could adversely affect our business and results of operations further changes in our management team may be disruptive to our business and any failure to successfully integrate key new hires or promoted employees could adversely 

affect our business and results of operations the complexity of our application delivery networking products and their integration into existing networks and ongoing support as well as the sophistication of our sales and marketing effort requires us to retain highly trained developers professional services customer support and sales personnel competition for qualified developers professional services customer support and sales personnel in our industry is intense because of the limited number of people available with the necessary technical skills and understanding of our products our ability to hire and retain these personnel may be adversely affected by volatility or reductions in the price of our common stock since these employees are generally granted restricted stock units the loss of services of any of our key personnel the inability to retain and attract qualified personnel in the future or delays in hiring qualified personnel may harm our business and results of operations 

we face litigation risks 

we are a party to lawsuits in the normal course of our business litigation in general and intellectual property and securities litigation in particular can be expensive lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations moreover the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict responding to lawsuits has been and will likely continue to be expensive and timeconsuming for us an unfavorable resolution of these lawsuits could adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

antitakeover provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us 

our board of directors has the authority to issue up to 10000000 shares of preferred stock and to determine the price rights preferences privileges and restrictions including voting rights of those shares without any further vote or action by the shareholders the rights of the holders of common stock may be subject to and may be adversely affected by the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future the issuance of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a change of control of our company without further action by our shareholders and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of the holders of common stock further certain provisions of our bylaws including a provision limiting the ability of shareholders to raise matters at a meeting of shareholders without giving advance notice may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or management of our company which could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock in addition our articles of incorporation currently provide for a staggered board which may make it more difficult for a third party to gain control of our board of directors similarly state antitakeover laws in the state of washington related to corporate takeovers may prevent or delay a change of control of our company 

our business is subject to the risks of earthquakes fire power outages floods and other catastrophic events and to interruption by manmade problems such as terrorism 

a significant natural disaster such as an earthquake a fire a flood or a significant power outage could have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition we have an administrative and product development office and a third party contract manufacturer located in the san francisco bay area a region known for seismic activity in addition natural disasters could affect our supply chain manufacturing vendors or logistics providers’ ability to provide materials and perform services such as manufacturing products or assisting with shipments on a timely basis in the event our or our service providers’ information technology systems or manufacturing or logistics abilities are hindered by any of the events discussed above shipments could be delayed resulting in missed financial targets such as revenue and shipment targets for a particular quarter in addition cyberattacks acts of terrorism or other geopolitical unrest could cause disruptions in our business or the business of our supply chain manufacturers logistics providers partners or endcustomers or the economy as a whole any disruption in the business of our supply chain manufacturers logistics providers partners or endcustomers that impacts sales at the end of a fiscal quarter could have a significant adverse impact on our quarterly results all of the aforementioned risks may be further increased if the disaster recovery plans for us and our suppliers prove to be inadequate to the extent that any of the above should result in delays or cancellations of customer orders or the delay in the manufacture deployment or shipment of our products our business financial condition and operating results would be adversely affected

 critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements 

revenue recognition we sell products through distributors resellers and directly to end users revenue is recognized provided that all of the following criteria have been met 

 revenue from the sale of products is generally recognized when the product has been shipped and the customer is obligated to pay for the product when rights of return are present and we cannot estimate returns revenue is recognized when such rights of return lapse payment terms to domestic customers are generally net 30 days to net 45 days payment terms to international customers range from net 30 days to net 120 days based on normal and customary trade practices in the individual markets we offer extended payment terms to certain customers in which case revenue is recognized when payments are due 

revenues for postcontract customer support pcs are recognized on a straightline basis over the service contract term pcs includes a limited period of telephone support updates repair or replacement of any failed product or component that fails during the term of the agreement bug fixes and rights to upgrades when and if available consulting services are customarily billed at fixed hourly rates plus outofpocket expenses and revenues are recognized when the consulting has been completed training revenue is recognized when the training has been completed 

arrangement consideration is first allocated between software consisting of nonessential and standalone software and nonsoftware deliverables the majority of our products are hardware appliances which contain software essential to the overall functionality of the products hardware appliances are generally sold with pcs and on occasion with consulting andor training services arrangement consideration in such multiple element transactions is allocated to each element based on a fair value hierarchy where the selling price for an element is based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe if available thirdparty evidence tpe if available and vsoe is not available or the best estimate of selling price besp if neither vsoe or tpe is available 

for software deliverables we allocate revenue between multiple elements based on software revenue recognition guidance software revenue recognition guidance requires revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements to be allocated to each element based on the relative fair values of those elements the fair value of an element must be based on vsoe where fair value of delivered elements is not available revenue is recognized on the “residual method” based on the fair value of undelivered elements if evidence of fair value of one or more undelivered elements does not exist all revenue is deferred and recognized at the earlier of the delivery of those elements or the establishment of fair value of the remaining undelivered elements 

we establish vsoe for our products pcs consulting and training services based on the sales price charged for each element when sold separately the sales price is discounted from the applicable list price based on various factors including the type of customer volume of sales geographic region and program level our list prices are generally not fair value as discounts 

may be given based on the factors enumerated above we use historical sales transactions to determine whether vsoe can be established for each of the elements in most instances vsoe of fair value is the sales price of actual standalone unbundled transactions within the past 12 month period when a substantial majority of transactions more than 80 are priced within a narrow range which we have determined to be plus or minus 15 of the median sales price 

we believe that the vsoe of fair value of training and consulting services is represented by the billable rate per hour based on the rates charged to customers when they purchase standalone training or consulting services the price of consulting services is not based on the type of customer volume of sales geographic region or program level 

we are typically not able to determine vsoe or tpe for nonsoftware products tpe is determined based on competitor prices for similar elements when sold separately generally our gotomarket strategy differs from that of other competitive products or services in its markets and our offerings contain a significant level of differentiation such that the comparable pricing of products with similar functionality cannot be obtained furthermore we are unable to reliably determine the selling prices on a standalone basis of similar products offered by our competitors 

when we are unable to establish selling price using vsoe or tpe we use besp in our allocation of arrangement consideration the objective of besp is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a standalone basis we have been able to establish besp through the list price less a discount deemed appropriate to maintain a reasonable gross margin management regularly reviews gross margin information at the consolidated level nonsoftware product besp is determined through our review of historical sales transactions within the past 12 month period additional factors considered in determining an appropriate besp include but are not limited to cost of products pricing practices geographies customer classes and distribution channels 

we regularly validate the vsoe of fair value and besp for elements in its multiple element arrangements we account for taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities on a net basis and excluded these amounts from revenues 

reserve for doubtful accounts estimates are used in determining our allowance for doubtful accounts and are based upon an assessment of selected accounts and as a percentage of our remaining accounts receivable by aging category in determining these percentages we evaluate historical writeoffs current trends in the credit quality of our customer base as well as changes in the credit policies we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition and do not require any collateral if there is deterioration of a major customer’s credit worthiness or actual defaults are higher than our historical experience our allowance for doubtful accounts may not be sufficient 

reserve for product returns in some instances product revenue from distributors is subject to agreements allowing rights of return product returns are estimated based on historical experience and are recorded at the time revenues are recognized accordingly we reduce recognized revenue for estimated future returns at the time revenue is recorded when rights of return are present and we cannot estimate returns revenue is recognized when such rights lapse the estimates for returns are adjusted periodically based upon changes in historical rates of returns and other related factors it is possible that these estimates will change in the future or that the actual amounts could vary from our estimates 

accounting for income taxes we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure including assessing the risks associated with tax audits together with assessing temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities due to the evolving nature and complexity of tax rules combined with the large number of jurisdictions in which we operate it is possible that our estimates of our tax liability could change in the future which may result in additional tax liabilities and adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

stockbased compensation we account for stockbased compensation using the straightline attribution method for recognizing compensation expense over the requisite service period of the related award we recognized 1272 million  and 1042 million  of stockbased compensation expense for the years ended september 30 2014  and 2013  respectively as of september 30 2014  there was 1000 million  of total unrecognized stockbased compensation cost the majority of which will be recognized over the next two  years going forward stockbased compensation expenses may increase as we issue additional equitybased awards to continue to attract and retain key employees 

we issue incentive awards to our employees through stockbased compensation consisting of restricted stock units rsus the value of rsus is determined using the fair value method which in this case is based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock on the date of grant 

we recognize compensation expense for only the portion of rsus that are expected to vest therefore we apply estimated forfeiture rates that are derived from historical employee termination behavior based on historical differences with forfeitures of stockbased awards granted to our executive officers and board of directors versus grants awarded to all other employees we developed separate forfeiture expectations for these two groups in fiscal year 2014  the estimated forfeiture rate for grants awarded to our executive officers and board of directors was approximately 66  and the estimated forfeiture rate for grants awarded to all other employees was approximately 73  if the actual number of forfeitures differs from those estimated by management additional adjustments to stockbased compensation expense may be required in future periods 

we recognize compensation costs for awards with performance conditions when we conclude it is probable that the performance condition will be achieved we reassess the probability of vesting at each balance sheet date and adjust compensation costs based on our probability assessment 

common stock repurchase on january 22 2014  we announced that our board of directors authorized an additional 500 million  for our common stock share repurchase program this new authorization is incremental to the existing 11 billion  program initially approved in october 2010 and expanded in august 2011 october 2011 april 2013 and november 2013 acquisitions for the share repurchase programs will be made from time to time in private transactions or open market purchases as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements the programs can be terminated at any time as of november 20 2014  we had repurchased and retired 18449755  shares at an average price of 8241  per share and we had 2796 million  remaining to purchase shares as part of our repurchase programs 

goodwill and intangible assets goodwill represents the excess purchase price over the estimated fair value of net assets acquired as of the acquisition date we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests when impairment indicators are identified goodwill is written down when impaired goodwill was recorded in connection with the acquisition of defensenet inc in may 2014 versafe ltd and linerate systems inc in fiscal year 2013 traffix systems in fiscal year 2012 acopia networks inc in fiscal year 2007 swan labs inc in fiscal year 2006 magnifire websystems inc in fiscal year 2004 and uroam inc in fiscal year 2003 for our annual goodwill impairment test in all periods to date we have operated under one reporting unit and the fair value of the reporting unit has been determined by the company’s enterprise value we perform our annual goodwill impairment test during the second fiscal quarter 

as part of the annual goodwill impairment test we first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary if as a result of its qualitative assessment it is morelikelythannot ie greater than 50 chance that the fair value of our reporting unit is less than its carrying amount the quantitative impairment test will be required otherwise no further testing will be required 

examples of events and circumstances that might indicate that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount include macroeconomic conditions such as deterioration in the entity’s operating environment or industry or market considerations entityspecific events such as increasing costs declining financial performance or loss of key personnel or other events such as an expectation that a reporting unit will be sold or a sustained decrease in the stock price on either an absolute basis or relative to peers 

if it is determined as a result of the qualitative assessment that it is morelikelythannot that the fair value of our reporting unit is less than its carrying amount the provisions of authoritative guidance require that we perform a twostep impairment test on goodwill the first step of the test identifies whether potential impairment may have occurred while the second step of the test measures the amount of the impairment if any impairment is recognized when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its fair value in march 2014 we completed a qualitative assessment of potential impairment indicators and concluded that it was morelikelythannot that the fair value of our reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount 

acquired inprocess research and development iprd are intangible assets initially recognized at fair value and classified as indefinitelived assets until the successful completion or abandonment of the associated research and development efforts during the development period these assets will not be amortized as charges to earnings instead these assets will be tested for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if impairment indicators are identified iprd was recorded in connection with the acquisition of linerate systems inc in february 2013 

investments our investments are diversified among highcredit quality debt securities in accordance with our investment policy we classify our investments as availableforsale which are reported at fair market value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss in stockholders’ equity realized gains and losses and declines in value of these investments judged to be other than temporary are included in other income expense to date we have not deemed it necessary to record any charges related to otherthantemporary declines in the estimated fair values of our marketable debt securities however the fair value of our investments is subject to volatility declines in the fair value of our investments judged to be other than temporary could adversely affect our future operating results

other income net other income net consists primarily of interest income and foreign currency transaction gains and losses other income net decreased 480  in fiscal year 2014  as compared to fiscal year 2013  and increased 231  in fiscal year 2013  as compared to fiscal year 2012  interest income was 57 million  63 million  and 69 million  for fiscal years 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively the decrease in other income net for fiscal year 2014  was primarily due to 17 million  in foreign currency losses compared to the prior year and a 10 million  charge for a legal settlement in the first quarter of fiscal year 2014 the increase in other income net for fiscal year 2013  as compared to fiscal year 2012  was primarily due to an increase in foreign currency transaction gains of 14 million  

provision for income taxes we recorded a 374  provision for income taxes for fiscal year 2014  compared to 367  for fiscal year 2013  and 363  for fiscal year 2012  the increase in the effective tax rate from fiscal year 2013 to 2014 was primarily due to the expiration of the united states federal credit for increasing research activities at december 31 2013 and due to additional tax benefit recognized during fiscal year 2013 as a result of the reinstatement of the united states federal credit for increasing research activities retroactive to january 1 2012 

we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized in making these determinations we consider historical and projected taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the appropriateness of a valuation allowance the net increase in the valuation allowance of 18 million  for fiscal year 2014 was primarily related to tax net operating losses incurred in certain foreign jurisdictions and state tax credit carryforwards our net deferred tax assets as of september 30 2014  and 2013  were 431 million  and 334 million  respectively 

our worldwide effective tax rate may fluctuate based on a number of factors including variations in projected taxable income in the various geographic locations in which we operate changes in the valuation of our net deferred tax assets resolution of potential exposures tax positions taken on tax returns filed in the various geographic locations in which we operate and the introduction of new accounting standards or changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof in the various geographic locations in which we operate we have recorded liabilities to address potential tax exposures related to business and income tax positions we have taken that could be challenged by taxing authorities the ultimate resolution of these potential exposures may be greater or less than the liabilities recorded which could result in an adjustment to our future tax expense 

liquidity and capital resources 

we have funded our operations with our cash balances cash generated from operations and proceeds from public offerings of our securities 

  



cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and longterm investments totaled 11283 million  as of september 30 2014  compared to 12711 million  as of september 30 2013  representing a decrease of 1428 million  the decrease was primarily due to 6505 million  of cash required for the repurchase of outstanding common stock under our share repurchase program in fiscal 2014  and cash requirements of 494 million  for the purchase of defensenet in the third fiscal quarter which was partially offset by cash provided by operating activities of 5490 million  for fiscal year 2014  in fiscal year 2013  the increase was primarily due to cash provided by operating activities of 4997 million  which was partially offset by 2000 million  of additional cash required for the repurchase of outstanding common stock under our share repurchase program in fiscal 2013  the increase in cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year 2013 was also partially offset by 1249 million  for the acquisition of linerate systems and 877 million  for the acquisition of versafe 

cash provided by operating activities during fiscal year 2014  was 5490 million  compared to 4997 million  in fiscal year 2013  and 4954 million  in fiscal year 2012  cash provided by operating activities resulted primarily from cash generated from net income after adjusting for noncash charges such as stockbased compensation depreciation and amortization charges and changes in operating assets and liabilities 

cash provided by investing activities during fiscal year 2014  was 1506 million  compared to cash used in investing activities of 3525 million  in fiscal year 2013  and cash used in investing activities of 3523 million  in fiscal year 2012  cash provided by investing activities for fiscal year 2014  was primarily the result of the sale and maturity of investments partially offset by the purchase of investments and capital expenditures related to maintaining our operations worldwide and 494 million  for the defensenet acquisition cash used in investing activities for fiscal year 2013  was primarily the result of he purchase of investments and capital expenditures related to maintaining our operations worldwide and 2126 million  for the linerate systems and versafe acquisitions partially offset by the sale and maturity of investments cash used in investing activities for fiscal year 2012  was primarily the result of the purchase of investments and capital expenditures related to maintaining our operations worldwide and 1283 million  for the acquisition of traffix systems partially offset by the sale and maturity of investments 

cash used in financing activities was 6050 million  for fiscal year 2014  compared to 1663 million  for fiscal year 2013  and 1492 million  for fiscal year 2012  cash used in financing activities for fiscal year 2014  included 6505 million  to repurchase common stock under our share repurchase program which was partially offset by cash received from the exercise of employee stock options and stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan of 353 million  and excess tax benefits related to sharebased compensation of 103 million  cash used in financing activities for fiscal year 2013  included 2000 million  to repurchase common stock under our share repurchase program which was partially offset by cash received from the exercise of employee stock options and stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan of 296 million  and excess tax benefits related to sharebased compensation of 41 million  cash used in financing activities for fiscal 2012  included 1848 million  to repurchase common stock under our share repurchase program which was partially offset by cash received from the exercise of employee stock options and stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan of 252 million  and excess tax benefits related to sharebased compensation of 104 million  

based on our current operating and capital expenditure forecasts we believe that our existing cash and investment balances together with cash generated from operations should be sufficient to meet our operating requirements for the next twelve months our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our rate of revenue growth the expansion of our sales and marketing activities the timing and extent of expansion into new territories the timing of introductions of new products and enhancements of existing products and the continuing market acceptance of our products 

obligations and commitments 

the following table summarizes our contractual payment obligations and commitments as of september 30 2014  

  



we lease our facilities under operating leases that expire at various dates through 2024  

as of september 30 2014  we had approximately 68 million  of tax liabilities including interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions see note 6 to our consolidated financial statements because of the high degree of uncertainty regarding the settlement of these liabilities we are unable to estimate the years in which future cash outflows may occur 

purchase obligations are comprised of purchase commitments with our contract manufacturers the agreement with our primary contract manufacturer allows it to procure component inventory on our behalf based on our production forecast we are obligated to purchase component inventory that the contract manufacturer procures in accordance with the forecast unless cancellation is given within applicable lead times 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in february 2013 the fasb issued asu 20132 comprehensive income topic 220 reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income  asu 20132 to improve the reporting of reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income asu 20132 requires presentation either on the face of the financial statements or in the notes of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component and by net income line item asu 20132 is effective prospectively for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after 

december 15 2012 we adopted asu 20132 in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 the adoption of asu 20132 did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements but did require additional disclosures 

in may 2014 the fasb issued asu 201409 revenue from contracts with customers  asu 201409 asu 201409 outlines a new single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance including industryspecific guidance the new model will require revenue recognition to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration a company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services the amendments in asu 201409 are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2016 including interim periods within that reporting period and early adoption is not permitted the standard can be applied either retrospectively to each period presented or as a cumulativeeffect adjustment as of the date of adoption we are currently assessing the impact that this updated standard will have on our consolidated financial statements and footnote disclosures 

in june 2014 the fasb issued asu 201412 compensation  stock compensation topic 718 accounting for sharebased payments when the terms of an award provide that a performance target could be achieved after the requisite service period  asu 201412 which requires that a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition as such the performance target should not be reflected in estimating the grant date fair value of the award this update further clarifies that compensation cost should be recognized in the period in which it becomes probable that the performance target will be achieved and should represent the compensation cost attributable to the periods for which the requisite service has already been rendered the new standard is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after december 15 2015 early adoption is permitted we do not anticipate that the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

tableend interest rate risk our cash equivalents consist of highquality securities as specified in our investment policy guidelines the policy limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue or issuer to a maximum of 5  of the total portfolio with the exception of us treasury and agency securities commercial paper and money market funds which are exempt from size limitation the policy requires investments in securities that mature in three years or less with the average maturity being no greater than one and a half years these securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if interest rates increase a decrease of one percent in the average interest rate would have resulted in a decrease of approximately 58 million  in our interest income for the fiscal year 2014  

  



foreign currency risk the majority of our sales and expenses are denominated in us dollars and as a result we have not experienced significant foreign currency transaction gains and losses to date while we have conducted some transactions in foreign currencies during the fiscal year ended september 30 2014  and expect to continue to do so we do not anticipate that foreign currency transaction gains or losses will be significant at our current level of operations however as we continue to expand our operations internationally transaction gains or losses may become significant in the future we have not engaged in foreign currency hedging to date however we may do so in the future

tableend general 

f5 networks is the leading developer and provider of application delivery services our core technology is a fullproxy programmable highlyscalable software platform called tmos traffic management operating system our principal products are application delivery controllers adcs 

introduced in 2004 the tmos platform currently supports the industry’s broadest array of features and functions designed to ensure that applications delivered over internet protocol ip networks are secure fast and available our tmosbased offerings include software products for local and global traffic management network and application security access management web acceleration and a number of other network and application services these products are available as modules that can run individually or as part of an integrated solution on our highperformance scalable purposebuilt appliances and chassisbased hardware or as softwareonly virtual editions designed to run on standard servers and major hypervisors in conjunction with our management software the availability of our products as both hardwarebased and softwareonly solutions gives customers the flexibility to create a dynamic control plane infrastructure tailored to the specific demands of private and public clouds as well as traditional data centers 

the core features and functions of tmos enable our products to inspect and modify the content of ip traffic flows between users and applications and support a broad and growing array of services irules a scripting language based on tool command language tcl is a unique feature of tmos that enables customers and third parties to write customized rules to inspect and modify traffic tmos also has an open software interface called icontrol which allows our products to communicate with one another and with thirdparty products and a scripting framework called icall that lets users define data plane events such as threshold breaches and adjust the behavior of our products accordingly tmos is designed to support the 

addition of new functionality as software modules and to exploit the performanceenhancing features of our purposebuilt hardware 

our hardware products include our bigip family of appliances and our line of scalable viprion systems these purposebuilt devices integrate industrystandard components such as generalpurpose processors and fpga fieldprogrammable gate arrays with components we design ourselves the architecture of these systems is designed to accelerate and optimize the performance of our software by offloading repetitive computeintensive functions such as encryption and compression to specific components and enabling complex applicationlayer processing at network speed typically deployed in front of web and application servers our hardware products deliver massive performance and scalability that enable customers to consolidate multiple application services on a single device this eliminates the need for separate point products which are often difficult and costly to integrate and manage and reduces the load on servers by offloading functions that might otherwise run on the servers themselves offloading functions from servers reduces the number of servers needed to run specific applications lowers the cost of power and cooling and drives down operating costs by simplifying the management of servers and applications in virtual environments this allows customers to increase the density of virtual servers and reduces the added complexity of managing a dynamic environment 

as information technology infrastructures continue to evolve there is growing demand for softwareonly application services that can be deployed in virtual environments next to each instance of an application for customers who prefer this option our virtual edition ve products offer faster throughput than competing products and the broadest array of integrated application services available we sell individual ve versions of all modules available on our hardwarebased solutions which provide the same software services and include all of the features and functions embedded in tmos these ve editions run on standard servers and major hypervisors 

while ves have lower performance than our hardwarebased solutions they give customers the flexibility to deploy a mix of integrated application services as needed spinning them up and down with each instance of an application and moving them with the application between traditional data centers and private or public clouds 

in addition to our tmosbased products we offer other closelyrelated products that facilitate enhance or extend our application services bigiq is an intelligent management framework designed to support multiple software modules that simplify the deployment and optimization of our application delivery services our traffix family of diameter signaling and routing products acquired in february 2012 offers the most advanced robust and costeffective solution for diameter routing load balancing and gateway connectivity enabling service providers to meet the multiple challenges associated with the growth of mobile data our arx storage virtualization products simplify the migration of data between storage devices the addition of new storage devices and the distribution of files across tiers of storage including cloud storage services that reflect their relative immediacy or importance 

during fiscal 2013 we purchased two small companies whose products and technology will further expand our addressable market in february 2013 we acquired linerate systems inc linerate systems an earlystage developer of softwaredefined application services that complement our current offerings although not commercially available at present linerate systems’ technology will eventually become an important part of f5’s broad range of initiatives focused on softwaredefined data centers in september 2013 we acquired versafe ltd versafe a privatelyheld company headquartered in rishon lezion israel that provides realtime protection for communications between enduser devices and web and mobile applications 

in connection with our products we offer a broad range of services including consulting training installation maintenance and other technical support services

industry background 

growth and evolution of ipbased infrastructures 

internet protocol ip is a communications language used to transmit data over the internet for more than two decades large business and government organizations have been gradually replacing older data center architectures with ipbased infrastructures deploying new ipbased applications and replacing or upgrading legacy applications with new ipenabled versions at the same time organizations have become more geographically dispersed and increasingly mobile workforces depend on access to corporate applications and data from remote locations and a variety of client devices including smartphones tablets and laptops 

in recent years the information technology landscape has changed dramatically as organizations have responded to the slowdown in the global economy by using technologies such as virtualization software defined networking and the growing availability and sophistication of cloud computing to reduce capital and operating costs and enhance the flexibility and efficiency of their information infrastructures these efforts are reflected in the ongoing trend toward data center consolidation that includes a reduction in the number and size of data centers as well as the number and variety of hardware devices in addition a growing number of organizations are turning to social networking and other online vehicles to help target customers and compete more effectively in an environment of reduced consumer spending the rapid growth of social networks such as facebook and twitter coupled with the explosion of mobile devices and applications has challenged the abilities of content and service providers to keep up with and monetize the growing demand for ipbased services 

emergence of the dynamic data center 

from a broad perspective the goal of it organizations is to optimize the secure delivery of applications to users wherever they are and whenever they need them to achieve these goals it organizations are embracing virtualization technologies that enable them to group or partition data center resources to meet user demand and reconfigure these virtual resources easily and quickly as demand changes the recent surge of interest in software defined networks highlights the latest move to reduce costs increase the flexibility and simplify the deployment and management of it infrastructure through virtualization many organizations are also taking advantage of the growing availability of external cloud resources as a flexible secure and reliable alternative to owning and managing everything themselves as a result it infrastructure has become increasingly dynamic complex and reliant on ipbased networks for the delivery of applications and data at the same time these changes have created new challenges to the security of ip networks and the applications and data accessible over the internet with increasing frequency sophisticated denial of service attacks have exposed a major vulnerability in the security perimeter of corporate networks by overwhelming firewalls and effectively shutting down the networks in addition many networklevel security threats are directly related to the improper use of the same protocols applications depend on to transmit data over the wire intrusion detection and prevention devices which rely on signature databases of known threats afford some protection against these types of attack however they offer no protection against many of the most common threats including information leakage content spoofing crosssite request forgery or “day zero” attacks designed to exploit a variety of application vulnerabilities 

in addition to preventing the threat of attacks designed to disrupt destroy or block access to network applications organizations are faced with the equally daunting challenge of controlling access to applications and data the proliferation of mobile devices has given users with smart phones tablets and laptops the ability to access corporate data centers from virtually anywhere this in turn has increased the difficulty of ensuring that mobile users are able to access applications and data for which they are authorized and that applications and data are protected from access by unauthorized users 

need to optimize the secure delivery of applications and data 

with the ongoing evolution and increasing complexity of it infrastructures there is a growing need to optimize the secure delivery of applications and data over ip networks ipbased traffic passing between client devices and servers is divided into discrete packets that travel by multiple routes to their destination where they are reassembled the disassembly routing and reassembly of transmissions are relatively straightforward and require little intelligence by contrast managing inspecting modifying redirecting and securing application traffic going to and from servers requires intelligent systems capable of performing a broad array of functions broadly speaking all of those functions are aspects of application delivery 

application delivery controllers or adcs dynamically manage the flow of traffic between users and servers physical or virtual making them look like a single resource to the user in addition they free up resources by offloading common network functions such as encryption ipv4ipv6 translation compression authentication rateshaping and a variety of specialized functions including network and application security services policy management and wan optimization that would otherwise run on the servers or be coded into applications since most large enterprises have hundreds — if not 

thousands — of servers and applications it is not practical to replicate these functions on each server or within each virtual instance of an application doing so would take up valuable network resources and reduce the number of applications that could run on each server maintenance costs would be prohibitive and the net result would be a negative impact on the overall performance of servers and applications offloading specific functions onto point solutions can eliminate those problems but introduces a new set of challenges using point solutions from multiple vendors can create interoperability issues and problems that do occur can be difficult to troubleshoot from a security standpoint it is also much more difficult to audit traffic passing through multiple devices providing a comprehensive set of integrated application delivery services on a single highperformance device simplifies management of the device and the servers it sits in front of and reduces overall capital and operating costs in virtual and cloud environments where flexibility is a priority softwareonly adcs provide the same services and many of the benefits associated with hardwarebased adcs 

although application delivery services are broadly applicable within enterprise and service provider it infrastructures the latter face unique challenges as they attempt to modernize and scale their networks to deal with the flood of data generated by smart phones tablets and other mobile devices to cope with these challenges service providers are migrating legacy 2g3g infrastructures to 4glte networks and evolved packet core epc data centers that require an array of network and application services today most of those services are deployed on separate appliances from different vendors apart from the associated capital costs integrating and managing multiple devices entail significant operating expense and service providers are actively seeking solutions that will enable them to lower costs and improve reliability and performance by consolidating services and reducing the number of devices to cope with the dramatic increase in signaling traffic associated with 4glte networks service providers have also adopted the diameter signaling protocol as the de facto standard for communication within their evolving data center infrastructure diameter signaling solutions offer unprecedented scalability reliability and performance on a single carriergrade purposebuilt platform 

f5’s strategy 

our goal is to lead the industry in providing application and network services that ensure the safe fast and reliable delivery of applications to any user anywhere anytime those services include availability security performance mobility and identity they also include managing and orchestrating resources as well as coordinating services across multiple data centers and networks our products are designed to be strategic points of control in the it infrastructure that allow business policies to be implemented where information is exchanged this enables organizations to respond quickly to changing business needs improve costly and time consuming business processes and develop new sources of revenue through highly differentiated offerings key components of our strategy include 

offering a complete integrated application delivery product suite 

since the introduction of tmos we have developed tmosbased versions of our own legacy products such as local traffic manager ltm global traffic manager gtm and link controller new products such as advanced firewall manager afm carrier grade network address translation cgnat and policy enforcement manager pem that leverage the unique performance characteristics of our hardware and software architecture and products that incorporate acquired technology including application security manager asm application acceleration manager aam application policy manager apm and edge gateway all of these products are currently available as integrated software modules on our bigip and viprion hardware or as virtual editions that run on any standard server or hypervisor we believe this approach sharply differentiates our products from our competitors’ offerings and provides customers with an expanding array of integrated application delivery solutions that can be customized to meet their specific needs 

investing in technology to meet evolving customer needs 

we continue to invest in research and development to provide our customers with comprehensive integrated application delivery services our product development efforts leverage the unique attributes of our tmos platform to deliver new features and functions that address the complex changing needs of our customers although the bulk of our investment is software development concurrent development of tightly integrated highperformance hardware is a key part of our investment strategy we also look for opportunities to acquire technologies that will enable us to broaden the scope of our offerings and expand into adjacent markets 

expanding our addressable market 

since the introduction of tmos we have continually expanded our addressable market and the definition of application delivery through the acquisition and development of new technology in 2003 for example we entered the market for secure remote access through the acquisition of uroam inc and its firepass ssl vpn technology that has become the core of our current apm offering the following year we entered the web application firewall market with the acquisition of magnifire websystems inc and its trafficshield security appliance which became the foundation of our application security manager 

asm by leveraging the programmability full proxy capabilities and builtin security features of tmos customers were also able to exploit the performance and scalability of our products and deploy them as icsacertified network firewalls in march 2013 we introduced advanced firewall manager afm a new software module that simplifies the deployment and management of our products as network firewalls and bigiq security a management framework that lets customers administer policies and manage afm across all of their f5 products in september 2013 we continued to expand our security solution with the acquisition of versafe a provider of web antifraud antiphishing and antimalware solutions while each of these products addresses a different segment of the broader security market they are all integral components of our comprehensive application delivery firewall offering and tightly integrated with ltm and the other features and functions available on our products as a result of this strategy and our development and acquisition of technology in other related markets such as wan optimization java script programming and diameter signaling and routing we believe our current addressable market is significantly larger than the adc market as industry analysts have traditionally defined it 

continuing to build and expand relationships with strategic technology partners 

to enhance our competitiveness in large accounts we have developed strategic technology partnerships with enterprise software vendors such as microsoft oracle vmware and others who have an established presence in those accounts by taking advantage of icontrol our open application programming interface and icall a scripting framework that provides the ability to define data plane events such as threshold breaches and adjust the behavior of our products accordingly these vendors can equip their applications to control our products in the network enhancing overall application performance in return they provide us significant leverage in the selling process by recommending our products to their customers we have also worked closely with several of these vendors to develop configurations of our products called iapps that are specifically designed to simplify deployment and optimize the performance of their applications these solutions are available as templates which allow quick and easy configuration of our products for specific applications we plan to continue building on our existing relationships and to extend our competitive edge by developing new strategic partnerships with other technology leaders including providers of software defined networking cloud and management and orchestration solutions 

leveraging devcentral our online community of network architects and developers 

customization of our tmosbased products using irules and our linerate technology with nodejs enhances their “stickiness” by allowing customers to solve problems in both their applications and their networks that would be difficult if not impossible to solve by other means to promote the use of irules and nodejs we host an online community devcentral where network architects and developers can discuss and share the ways in which they use irules and nodejs to solve problems and enhance the security performance and availability of applications a corollary benefit is that many of the irules solutions posted by devcentral participants have become standard features in new releases of tmos devcentral also provides a valuable window into our customers’ constantly evolving needs 

f5 solutions 

our integrated family of tmosbased network and application services are software products that run on purposebuilt hardware and are also available as virtual softwareonly editions or ves these products function as strategic points of control in ip networks inspecting modifying and directing traffic to optimize the security availability and delivery of applications and data to any user anywhere our linerate technology supports similar functionality in softwareonly solutions designed to meet the specialized needs of softwaredefined data centers our traffix diameter signaling and routing devices address the complex needs of service providers by enabling fast reliable communications among the elements of their legacy infrastructures and their evolving packetbased 4glte networks and data centers we believe our products offer the most intelligent services and advanced functionality in the marketplace along with performance and flexibility that enable organizations to simplify management of their ip networks and data center operations by integrating disparate resources to reduce operating costs enhance productivity and improve service to employees customers and partners 

application delivery 

since 2004 we have expanded the breadth of features and functionality we offer well beyond the scope of application delivery networking as it has been traditionally defined today we also offer solutions that include application security secure remote access firewall protection wan optimization access policy management carrier grade nat diameter signaling policy enforcement and fraud detection opening up large opportunities in several adjacent markets many of the features and functions that differentiate our products are built into tmos our fullproxy operating system others are available as software modules that run on tmos or as tmosbased ves 

software

product development 

we believe our future success depends on our ability to maintain technology leadership by continuing to improve our products and by developing new products to meet the changing needs of our customers our product development organization employs a standard process for the development documentation and quality control of software and systems that is designed to meet these goals this process includes working with our business development and marketing teams product managers customers and partners to identify new or improved solutions that meet the evolving needs of our addressable markets 

our principal software engineering team is located in our headquarters in seattle washington product development for apm pem and aam is located in san jose california asm traffix sdc and versafe product development is located in tel aviv israel arx product development is in lowell massachusetts our hardware engineering team is located in spokane washington in addition we maintain a dedicated facility for product testing and quality control in tomsk russia members of all our product development teams collaborate closely with one another to ensure the interoperability and performance of our hardware and software systems 

during the fiscal years ended september 30 2013  2012  and 2011  we had research and product development expenses of 2096 million  1774 million  and 1389 million  respectively 

customers 

our customers include a wide variety of enterprise and service providers among fortune 1000 and business week global 1000 companies including those in technology telecommunications financial services transportation education manufacturing and healthcare along with government customers in fiscal year 2013  sales outside of the americas represented 425  of our net revenues refer to note 10 of our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding our revenues by geographic area 

sales and marketing 

sales 

we sell our products and services to large enterprise customers and service providers through a variety of channels including distributors valueadded resellers vars and systems integrators a substantial amount of our revenue for fiscal year 2013  was derived from these channel sales our sales teams work closely with our channel partners and also sell our products and services directly to major accounts 

f5 sales teams our inside sales team generates and qualifies leads for regional sales managers and helps manage accounts by serving as a liaison between the field and internal corporate resources our field sales personnel are located in major cities in four sales regions the americas primarily the united states europe the middle east and africa emea japan and the asia pacific region apac field sales personnel work closely with our channel partners to assist them as necessary in the sale of our products and services to their customers we also sell our products and services directly to customers primarily large enterprises whose accounts are managed by our major account services team field systems 

engineers support our regional sales managers and channel partners by participating in joint sales calls and providing presale technical resources as needed 

distributors and vars as a key component of our sales strategy we have established relationships with a number of large national and international distributors local and specialized distributors and vars we derive a majority of our product sales from vars and rely on our large distributors primarily for fulfillment 

our agreements with these channel partners are not exclusive and do not prevent them from selling competitive products these agreements typically have terms of one year with no obligation to renew and typically do not provide for exclusive sales territories or minimum purchase requirements 

for fiscal year 2013  sales to three of our worldwide distributors avnet technology solutions ingram micro inc and westcon group inc represented 166  157  and 118  of our total revenues respectively our agreements with these distributors are standard nonexclusive distribution agreements that renew automatically on an annual basis and generally can be terminated by either party with 30 days written notice prior to the start of any renewal term the agreements grant avnet technology solutions ingram micro inc and westcon group inc the right to distribute our products to resellers in north america and certain other territories internationally with no minimum purchase requirements 

systems integrators we also market our products through strategic relationships with systems integrators including dell services hp enterprise services and ibm global services who include our products as core components of application or networkbased solutions they deploy for their customers in most cases systems integrators do not directly purchase our products for resale to their customers instead they typically recommend our products as part of broader solutions such as enterprise resource planning erp or customer relationship management crm solutions that incorporate our products for high availability and enhanced performance 

resellers and technology partners  historically our ability to compete with much larger companies such as cisco systems has been strengthened through partnerships with large systems vendors such as dell and hewlettpackard who resell our products and through technology partnerships with large software vendors such as microsoft oracle and vmware who recommend our products to their customers management of these relationships is the responsibility of our business development team a component of our sales organization which closely monitors technology companies in adjacent and complementary markets for opportunities to partner with those whose solutions are complementary to ours and could enable us to expand our addressable market 

marketing 

our marketing strategy is driven by the belief that our continued success depends on our ability to understand and anticipate the dynamic needs of our addressable markets and to develop valuable solutions that meet those needs in line with this belief our marketing organization works directly with customers partners and our product development teams to identify and create innovative solutions to further enhance our leadership position 

to support the growing number of developers using our products including network and application architects we continue to promote and expand devcentral our online community website that provides technical resources to customers prospects and partners wanting to extend and optimize f5 solutions using irules and icall a key aspect of devcentral is an online forum where developers as well as application and network architects discuss and share solutions they have written with irules and icall at the end of fiscal year 2013  devcentral had more than 134000 registered members 

we also engage in a number of marketing programs and initiatives aimed at promoting our brand and creating market awareness of our technology and products these include actively participating in industry trade shows and joint marketing events with channel and technology partners and briefing industry analysts and members of the trade press on our latest products business relationships and technology partnerships in addition we market our products to chief information officers and other information technology professionals through targeted advertising direct mail and highprofile web events 

backlog 

at the end of fiscal years 2013  and 2012  we had product backlog of approximately 579 million  and 388 million  respectively backlog represents orders confirmed with a purchase order for products to be shipped generally within 90 days to customers with approved credit status orders are subject to cancellation rescheduling by customers or product specification changes by customers although we believe that the backlog orders are firm purchase orders may be cancelled by the customer prior to shipment without significant penalty for this reason we believe that our product backlog at any given date is not a reliable indicator of future revenues 

customer service and technical support 

we believe that our ability to provide consistent highquality customer service and technical support is a key factor in attracting and retaining large enterprise customers accordingly we offer a broad range of support services that include installation phone support hardware repair and replacement software updates online tools consulting and training services 

we provide these services directly to end users and also utilize a multitiered support model leveraging the capabilities of our channel partners when applicable our technical support staff is strategically located in regional service centers to support our global customer base 

prior to the installation of our products our services personnel work with customers to analyze their network needs and determine the best way to deploy our products and configure product features and functions to meet those needs our services personnel also provide onsite installation and training services to help customers make optimal use of product features and functions 

our customers typically purchase a oneyear maintenance contract which entitles them to an array of services provided by our technical support team maintenance services provided under the contract include online updates software error correction releases hardware repair and replacement and in the majority of cases roundtheclock call center support free updates of our software are available to customers with a current maintenance contract our technical support team also offers seminars and training classes for customers on the configuration and use of products including local and wide area network system administration and management in addition we have a professional services team able to provide a full range of feebased consulting services including comprehensive network management documentation and performance analysis and capacity planning to assist in predicting future network requirements 

as part of our maintenance service we offer an online automated selfhelp customer support function called “ask f5” that provides answers to many commonly asked questions allowing customers to get information and solve problems quickly while significantly reducing the number of calls to our support desk this enables us to provide comprehensive customer support while keeping our supportrelated expenses at a manageable consistent level we also offer an online service called ihealth which allows customers to diagnose uptotheminute snapshots of their bigip systems diagnoses include tailored feedback about configuration issues or code defects a description of the issue recommendations for resolution and a link to further information in the askf5 ™  knowledge base 

manufacturing 

we outsource the manufacturing of our preconfigured hardware platforms to third party contract manufacturers for assembly according to our specifications 

flextronics manufactures our adc product line and sanminasci manufactures our arx product line the subcontracting activity at flextronics and sanminasci encompasses prototype builds full production and direct fulfillment our contract manufacturers perform the following activities on our behalf material procurement pcb assembly and test final assembly system test quality control direct shipment and warranty repairs we provide a rolling forecast that allows our contract manufacturers to stock component parts and other materials plan capacity and build finished goods inventory in anticipation of end user demand each of the contract manufacturers procures components in volumes consistent with our forecast necessary to assemble the products and tests the products according to our specifications products are then shipped to our distributors valueadded resellers or end users generally we do not own the components title to the products transfers from the contract manufacturers to us and then to our customers upon delivery at a designated shipment location if the components are unused or the products are not sold within specified periods of time we may incur carrying charges or obsolete material charges for components that our contract manufacturers purchased to build products to meet our forecast or customer orders 

hardware platforms for our products consist primarily of commodity parts and certain custom components designed and approved by our hardware engineering group most of our components are purchased from sources which we believe are readily available from other suppliers however several components used in the assembly of our products are purchased from a single or limited source 

certain subassembly and testing processes of our adc products are performed at flextronics facility in zhuhai china the majority of our subassemblies are shipped to flextronics milpitas california plant for configuration and final testing and eventual distribution to our end users we also have capabilities to complete configuration and final testing of some of our products in flextronics zhuhai china plant for distribution to apac end users 

competition 

the expanding capabilities of our product offerings have enabled us to address a growing array of market opportunities many of which are outside the bounds of the application delivery networking market as defined and measured by industry analysts such as gartner group dell’oro and others in addition to server loadbalancing and other functions normally associated with application delivery our suite of integrated product modules has expanded our addressable market into security wan optimization application acceleration policy management and diameter signaling where we compete with a growing number of companies not included among traditional adc vendors the ability to create custom network services using irules and icall has also enabled us our customers and our partners to design solutions to problems for which there is no offtheshelf solution as a result we believe the traditional definitions of our market do not encompass all of the features functions and capabilities of our products or accurately represent the addressable market for those products 

within the more narrowly defined traditional adc market several companies sell server loadbalancing products these include brocade communications systems inc citrix systems inc radware ltd and a number of smaller competitors a10 networks array networks inc barracuda networks inc and riverbed technology 

in related adc markets we compete with the following 

 the principal competitive factors in the markets in which we compete include product features and performance customer support brand recognition the scope of distribution and sales channels and pricing certain of our competitors have and may in the future adopt aggressive pricing policies to gain market share however because of the superior performance broad functionality and unique capabilities of our products which have resulted in high levels of customer satisfaction and growing brand awareness we believe that we can and will compete effectively against such pricing policies 

intellectual property 

we rely on a combination of patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights we have obtained 176  patents in the united states 13 foreign patents and have applications pending for various aspects of our technology our future success depends in part on our ability to protect our proprietary rights to the technologies used in our principal products despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use trade secrets or other information that we regard as proprietary in addition the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights as fully as do the laws of the united states any issued patent may not preserve our proprietary position and competitors or others may develop technologies similar to or superior to our technology our failure to enforce and protect our intellectual property rights could harm our business operating results and financial condition 

in addition to our own proprietary software we incorporate software licensed from several thirdparty sources into our products these are generally term licenses which may renew annually and that generally provide for certain rights and licenses to support our customers post termination while we may not be able to renew certain of these licenses in the future we believe that alternative technologies for these licenses are available both domestically and internationally 

employees 

as of september 30 2013  we had 3356 fulltime employees including 920  in product development 1319 in sales and marketing 770  in professional services and technical support and 347  in accounting and finance administration and operations none of our employees is represented by a labor union we have experienced no work stoppages and believe that our employee relations are good

 item 1a 

risk factors 

tableend in addition to the other information in this report the following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating our company and its business 

our quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate in future periods which may cause our stock price to fluctuate 

our quarterly and annual operating results have varied significantly in the past and could vary significantly in the future which makes it difficult for us to predict our future operating results our operating results may fluctuate due to a variety of factors many of which are outside of our control including the changing and recently volatile us and global economic environment which may cause our stock price to fluctuate in particular we anticipate that the size of customer orders may increase as we continue to focus on larger business accounts a delay in the recognition of revenue even from just one account may have a significant negative impact on our results of operations for a given period in the past a majority of our sales have been realized near the end of a quarter accordingly a delay in an anticipated sale past the end of a particular quarter may negatively impact our results of operations for that quarter or in some cases that fiscal year additionally we have exposure to the credit risks of some of our customers and subtenants although we have programs in place that are designed to monitor and mitigate the associated risk there can be no assurance that such programs will be effective in reducing our credit risks adequately we monitor individual payment capability in granting credit arrangements seek to limit the total credit to amounts we believe our customers can pay and maintain reserves we believe are adequate to cover exposure for potential losses if there is a deterioration of a subtenant’s or a major customer’s creditworthiness or actual defaults are higher than expected future losses if incurred could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our operating results further our operating results may be below the expectations of securities analysts and investors in future quarters or years our failure to meet these expectations will likely harm the market price of our common stock such a decline could occur and has occurred in the past even when we have met our publicly stated revenue andor earnings guidance 

our stock price could be volatile particularly during times of economic uncertainty and volatility in domestic and international stock markets 

our stock price has been volatile and has fluctuated significantly in the past the trading price of our stock is likely to continue to be volatile and subject to fluctuations in the future some of the factors that could significantly affect the market price of our stock include 

 the stock market in general and the market for technology companies in particular have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations these fluctuations have often been unrelated or disproportionate to operating performance the fluctuations may continue in the future and this could significantly impact the value of our stock and your investment 

our business could be adversely impacted by conditions affecting the information technology market 

a substantial portion of our business depends on the demand for information technology by large enterprise customers and service providers the overall economic health of our current and prospective customers and the continued growth and evolution of the internet international national regional and local economic conditions such as recessionary economic cycles protracted economic slowdown or further deterioration of the economy could adversely impact demand for our products demand for our products and services depends substantially upon the general demand for application delivery products and associated services which fluctuates based on numerous factors including capital spending levels and growth of our current and prospective customers as well as general economic conditions moreover the purchase of our products is often discretionary and may involve a significant commitment of capital and other resources future economic projections for the information technology sector are uncertain as companies continue to reassess their spending for technology projects and embrace new models for delivery of it services as are result spending priorities for our current and future customers may vary and demand for our products and services may be impacted fluctuations in the demand for our products and services could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

industry consolidation may result in increased competition 

some of our competitors have made acquisitions or entered into partnerships or other strategic relationships to offer a more comprehensive solution than they had previously offered additionally as it companies attempt to strengthen or maintain their market positions in the evolving application delivery mobility cloud networking and cloud platform markets these companies continue to seek to deliver comprehensive it solutions to end users and combine enterpriselevel hardware and software solutions that may compete with our solutions these consolidators or potential consolidators may have significantly greater financial technical and other resources than we do and may be better positioned to acquire and offer complementary products and services the companies resulting from these possible combinations may create more compelling product and service offerings and be able to offer greater pricing flexibility or sales and marketing support for such offerings than we can these heightened competitive pressures could result in a loss of customers or a reduction in our revenues or revenue growth rates all of which could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

in addition to other risks listed in this “risk factors” section factors that may affect our operating results include but are not limited to 

 our success depends on our timely development of new products and features market acceptance of new product offerings and proper management of the timing of the life cycle of our products 

the markets for our products and services are characterized by 

 our continued success depends on our ability to identify and develop new products and new features for our existing products to meet the demands of these changes and the acceptance of those products and features by our existing and target 

customers if we are unable to identify develop and deploy new products and new product features on a timely basis our business and results of operations may be harmed 

the current development cycle for our products is on average 1224 months the introduction of new products or product enhancements may shorten the life cycle of our existing products or replace sales of some of our current products thereby offsetting the benefit of even a successful product introduction and may cause customers to defer purchasing our existing products in anticipation of the new products this could harm our operating results by decreasing sales increasing our inventory levels of older products and exposing us to greater risk of product obsolescence we have also experienced and may in the future experience delays in developing and releasing new products and product enhancements this has led to and may in the future lead to delayed sales increased expenses and lower quarterly revenue than anticipated also in the development of our products we have experienced delays in the prototyping of our products which in turn has led to delays in product introductions in addition complexity and difficulties in managing product transitions at the endoflife stage of a product can create excess inventory of components associated with the outgoing product that can lead to increased expenses any or all of the above problems could materially harm our business and results of operations 

our success depends on sales and continued innovation of our application delivery networking product lines 

for the fiscal year ended september 30 2013  we derived approximately 993  of our net product revenues or approximately 535  of our total net revenues from sales of our application delivery networking adn product lines we expect to continue to derive a significant portion of our net revenues from sales of our adn products in the future implementation of our strategy depends upon these products being able to solve critical network availability performance and security problems for our customers if our adn products are unable to solve these problems for our customers or if we are unable to sustain the high levels of innovation in our adn product feature set needed to maintain leadership in what will continue to be a competitive market environment our business and results of operations will be harmed 

we may not be able to compete effectively in the emerging application delivery networking and file virtualization markets 

the markets we serve are new rapidly evolving and highly competitive and we expect competition to persist and intensify in the future our principal competitors in the application delivery networking market include brocade communications systems inc cisco systems inc citrix systems inc radware ltd and a10 networks in related adc markets we compete with the following 

 we expect to continue to face additional competition as new participants enter our markets as we continue to expand globally we may see new competitors in different geographic regions in addition larger companies with significant resources brand recognition and sales channels may form alliances with or acquire competing application delivery networking solutions from other companies and emerge as significant competitors potential competitors may bundle their products or incorporate an internet traffic management or security component into existing products in a manner that discourages users from purchasing our products any of these circumstances may limit our opportunities for growth and negatively impact our financial performance 

the average selling price of our products may decrease and our costs may increase which may negatively impact gross profits 

it is possible that the average selling prices of our products will decrease in the future in response to competitive pricing pressures increased sales discounts new product introductions by us or our competitors or other factors therefore in order to maintain our gross profits we must develop and introduce new products and product enhancements on a timely basis and continually reduce our product costs our failure to do so will cause our net revenue and gross profits to decline which will harm our business and results of operations in addition we may experience substantial periodtoperiod fluctuations in future operating results due to the erosion of our average selling prices 

it is difficult to predict our future operating results because we have an unpredictable sales cycle 

our products have a lengthy sales cycle and the timing of our revenue is difficult to predict historically our sales cycle has ranged from approximately two to three months and has tended to lengthen as we have increasingly focused our sales efforts on the enterprise market also as our distribution strategy has evolved into more of a channel model utilizing valueadded resellers distributors and systems integrators the level of variability in the length of sales cycle across transactions has increased and made it more difficult to predict the timing of many of our sales transactions sales of our products require us to educate potential customers in their use and benefits sales of our products are subject to delays from the lengthy internal budgeting approval and competitive evaluation processes that large corporations and governmental entities may require for example customers frequently begin by evaluating our products on a limited basis and devote time and resources to testing our products before they decide whether or not to purchase customers may also defer orders as a result of anticipated releases of new products or enhancements by our competitors or us as a result our products have an unpredictable sales cycle that contributes to the uncertainty of our future operating results 

our business may be harmed if our contract manufacturers are not able to provide us with adequate supplies of our products or if a single source of hardware assembly is lost or impaired 

we outsource the manufacturing of our hardware platforms to third party contract manufacturers who assemble these hardware platforms to our specifications we have experienced minor delays in shipments from contract manufacturers in the past however if we experience major delays in the future or other problems such as inferior quality and insufficient quantity of product any one or a combination of these factors may harm our business and results of operations the inability of our contract manufacturers to provide us with adequate supplies of our products or the loss of one or more of our contract manufacturers may cause a delay in our ability to fulfill orders while we obtain a replacement manufacturer and may harm our business and results of operations in particular we currently subcontract manufacturing of our application delivery networking products to a single contract manufacturer with whom we do not have a longterm contract if our arrangement with this single source of hardware assembly was terminated or otherwise impaired and we were not able to engage another contract manufacturer in a timely manner our business financial condition and results of operation could be adversely affected 

if the demand for our products grows we will need to increase our raw material and component purchases contract manufacturing capacity and internal test and quality control functions any disruptions in product flow may limit our revenue may harm our competitive position and may result in additional costs or cancellation of orders by our customers 

our business could suffer if there are any interruptions or delays in the supply of hardware components from our thirdparty sources 

we currently purchase several hardware components used in the assembly of our products from a number of single or limited sources lead times for these components vary significantly the unavailability of suitable components any interruption or delay in the supply of any of these hardware components or the inability to procure a similar component from alternate sources at acceptable prices within a reasonable time may delay assembly and sales of our products and hence our revenues and may harm our business and results of operations 

we are subject to governmental export and import controls that could subject us to liability or impair our ability to compete in international markets 

our products are subject to us export controls and may be exported outside the us only with the required level of export license or through an export license exception because we incorporate encryption technology into our products in addition various countries regulate the import of certain encryption technology and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute our products or our customers’ ability to implement our products in those countries changes in our products or changes in export and import regulations may create delays in the introduction of our products in international markets prevent our customers with international operations from deploying our products throughout their global systems or in some cases prevent the export or import of our products to certain countries altogether any change in export or import regulations or related legislation shift in approach to the enforcement or scope of existing regulations or change in the countries persons or technologies targeted by such regulations could result in decreased use of our products by or in our decreased ability to export or sell our products to existing or potential customers with international operations any decreased use of our products or limitation on our ability to export or sell our products would likely adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

reliance on shipments at the end of the quarter could cause our revenue for the applicable period to fall below expected levels 

as a result of customer buying patterns and the efforts of our sales force and channel partners to meet or exceed their sales objectives we have historically received a substantial portion of sales orders and generated a substantial portion of revenue during the last few weeks of each fiscal quarter in addition any significant interruption in our information technology systems which manage critical functions such as order processing revenue recognition financial forecasts inventory and supply chain management and trade compliance reviews could result in delayed order fulfillment and decreased revenue for that fiscal quarter if expected revenue at the end of any fiscal quarter is delayed for any reason including the failure of anticipated purchase orders to materialize our third party contract manufacturers’ inability to manufacture and ship products prior to fiscal quarterend to fulfill purchase orders received near the end of the fiscal quarter our failure to manage inventory to meet demand our inability to release new products on schedule any failure of our systems related to order review and processing or any delays in shipments based on trade compliance requirements our revenue for that quarter could fall below our expectations resulting in a decline in the trading price of our common stock 

we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property and our products may infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties 

we rely on a combination of patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure of confidential and proprietary information to protect our intellectual property rights despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology monitoring unauthorized use of our products is difficult and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of our technology particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 

our industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the ordinary course of our business we are involved in disputes and licensing discussions with others regarding their claimed proprietary rights and cannot provide assurance that we will always successfully defend ourselves against such claims we expect that infringement claims may increase as the number of products and competitors in our market increases and overlaps occur also as we have gained greater visibility market exposure and competitive success we face a higher risk of being the subject of intellectual property infringement claims if we are found to infringe the proprietary rights of others or if we otherwise settle such claims we could be compelled to pay damages or royalties and either obtain a license to those intellectual property rights or alter our products so that they no longer infringe upon such proprietary rights any license could be very expensive to obtain or may not be available at all similarly changing our products or processes to avoid infringing upon the rights of others may be costly or impractical in addition we have initiated and may in the future initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to determine the scope and validity of our proprietary rights or those of our competitors any of these claims whether claims that we are infringing the proprietary rights of others or vice versa with or without merit may be timeconsuming result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel or require us to cease using infringing technology develop noninfringing technology or enter into royalty or licensing agreements further our license agreements typically require us to indemnify our customers distributors and resellers for infringement actions related to our technology which could cause us to become involved in infringement claims made against our customers distributors or resellers any of the abovedescribed circumstances relating to intellectual property rights disputes could result in our business and results of operations being harmed 

we incorporate open source software into our products although we monitor our use of open source closely the terms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by us courts and there is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products we could also be subject to similar conditions or restrictions should there be any changes in the licensing terms of the open source software incorporated into our products in either event we could be required to seek licenses from third parties in order to continue offering our products to reengineer our products or to discontinue the sale of our products in the event reengineering cannot be accomplished on a timely or successful basis any of which could adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

many of our products include intellectual property licensed from third parties in the future it may be necessary to renew licenses for third party intellectual property or obtain new licenses for other technology these third party licenses may not be available to us on acceptable terms if at all the inability to obtain certain licenses or litigation regarding the interpretation or enforcement of license rights and related intellectual property issues could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition furthermore we license some third party intellectual property on a nonexclusive basis and this may limit our ability to protect our intellectual property rights in our products 

we may not be able to sustain or develop new distribution relationships and a reduction or delay in sales to significant distribution partners could hurt our business 

we sell our products and services through multiple distribution channels in the united states and internationally including leading industry distributors valueadded resellers systems integrators service providers and other indirect channel partners we have a limited number of agreements with companies in these channels and we may not be able to increase our number of distribution relationships or maintain our existing relationships recruiting and retaining qualified channel partners and training them in our technologies requires significant time and resources these channel partners may also market sell and support products and services that are competitive with ours and may devote more resources to the marketing sales and support of such competitive products our indirect sales channel structure could subject us to lawsuits potential liability and reputational harm if for example any of our channel partners misrepresent the functionality of our products or services to customers or violate laws or our corporate policies if we are unable to establish or maintain our indirect sales channels our business and results of operations will be harmed in addition three worldwide distributors of our products accounted for 441  of our total net revenue for fiscal year 2013  two worldwide distributors of our products accounted for 309  of our total net revenue for fiscal year 2012  a substantial reduction or delay in sales of our products to these distribution partners if not replaced by sales to other indirect channel partners and distributors could harm our business operating results and financial condition 

undetected software or hardware errors or security vulnerabilities may harm our business and results of operations 

our products may contain undetected errors or defects when first introduced or as new versions are released we have experienced these errors or defects in the past in connection with new products and product upgrades we expect that these errors or defects will be found from time to time in new or enhanced products after commencement of commercial shipments these problems may cause us to incur significant warranty and repair costs divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts and cause significant customer relations problems we may also be subject to liability claims for damages related to product errors or defects while we carry insurance policies covering this type of liability these policies may not provide sufficient protection should a claim be asserted a material product liability claim may harm our business and results of operations 

our products must successfully operate with products from other vendors as a result when problems occur in a network it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem the occurrence of software or hardware problems whether caused by our products or another vendor’s products may result in the delay or loss of market acceptance of our products the occurrence of any of these problems may harm our business and results of operations 

our products are used to manage critical applications and data for customers and third parties may attempt to exploit security vulnerabilities in our products as we continue to focus on the development and marketing of security solutions we become a bigger target for malicious computer hackers who wish to exploit security vulnerabilities in our products these problems may cause us to incur significant remediation costs divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts and cause significant customer relations problems adverse publicity related to security vulnerabilities or damage to a customer’s operations due to exploitation of security vulnerability in our products may harm our business and results of operations 

any errors defects or vulnerabilities in our products could result in 

 we are dependent on various information technology systems and failures of or interruptions to those systems could harm our business 

many of our business processes depend upon our information technology it systems the systems and processes of third parties and on interfaces with the systems of third parties for example our order entry system provides information to the systems of our contract manufacturers which enables them to build and ship our products if those systems fail or are 

interrupted or if our ability to connect to or interact with one or more networks is interrupted our processes may function at a diminished level or not at all this would harm our ability to ship products and our financial results may be harmed 

in addition reconfiguring our it systems or other business processes in response to changing business needs may be timeconsuming and costly to the extent this impacted our ability to react timely to specific market or business opportunities our financial results may be harmed 

our operating results are exposed to risks associated with international commerce 

as our international sales increase our operating results become more exposed to international operating risks additionally our international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks including the following 

 we must hire and train experienced personnel to staff and manage our foreign operations to the extent that we experience difficulties in recruiting training managing and retaining an international staff and specifically staff related to sales management and sales personnel we may experience difficulties in sales productivity in foreign markets we also enter into strategic distributor and reseller relationships with companies in certain international markets where we do not have a local presence if we are not able to maintain successful strategic distributor relationships internationally or recruit additional companies to enter into strategic distributor relationships our future success in these international markets could be limited business practices in the international markets that we serve may differ from those in the united states and may require us in the future to include terms other than our standard terms in customer contracts we intend to continue expanding into international markets sales outside of the americas represented 425  and 424  of our net revenues for the fiscal years ended september 30 2013  and 2012  respectively 

these factors and other factors could harm our ability to gain future international revenues and consequently materially impact our business operating results and financial condition the expansion of our existing international operations and entry into additional international markets will require significant management attention and financial resources our failure to successfully manage our international operations and the associated risks effectively could limit the future growth of our business 

a portion of our revenue is generated by sales to government entities which are subject to a number of challenges and risks 

sales to us and foreign federal state and local governmental agency endcustomers account for a significant portion of our revenues and we may in the future increase sales to government entities sales to government entities are subject to a number of risks selling to government entities can be highly competitive expensive and time consuming often requiring significant upfront time and expense without any assurance that these efforts will generate a sale the substantial majority of our sales to date to government entities have been made indirectly through our channel partners government certification 

requirements for products like ours may change thereby restricting our ability to sell into the federal government sector until we have attained the revised certification government demand and payment for our products and services may be impacted by public sector budgetary cycles and funding authorizations with funding reductions or delays adversely affecting public sector demand for our products and services government entities may have statutory contractual or other legal rights to terminate contracts with our distributors and resellers for convenience or due to a default and any such termination may adversely impact our future operating results governments routinely investigate and audit government contractors’ administrative processes and any unfavorable audit could result in the government refusing to continue buying our products and services a reduction of revenue or fines or civil or criminal liability if the audit uncovers improper or illegal activities which could adversely impact our operating results in a material way finally for purchases by the us government the government may require certain products to be manufactured in the united states and other relatively high cost manufacturing locations and we may not manufacture all products in locations that meet the requirements of the us government affecting our ability to sell these products to the us government 

our failure to adequately protect personal information could have a material adverse effect on our business 

a wide variety of local state national and international laws directives and regulations apply to the collection use retention protection disclosure transfer and other processing of personal data these data protection and privacyrelated laws and regulations continue to evolve and may result in everincreasing regulatory and public scrutiny and escalating levels of enforcement and sanctions and increased costs of compliance our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or to protect such data could result in enforcement action against us including fines imprisonment of company officials and public censure claims for damages by endcustomers and other affected individuals damage to our reputation and loss of goodwill both in relation to existing endcustomers and prospective endcustomers any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations financial performance and business changing definitions of personal data and personal information within the european union the united states and elsewhere especially relating to classification of ip addresses machine identification location data and other information may limit or inhibit our ability to operate or expand our business including limiting strategic partnerships that may involve the sharing of data 

misuse of our products could harm our reputation 

our products may be misused by endcustomers or third parties that obtain access to our products for example our products could be used to censor private access to certain information on the internet such use of our products for censorship could result in negative publicity and damage to our reputation in addition as many of our products are subject to export control regulations diversion of our products to restricted third parties by others could result in investigations penalties fines trade restrictions and negative publicity that could damage our reputation and materially impact our business operating results and financial condition 

changes in governmental regulations could negatively affect our revenues 

many of our products are subject to various regulations promulgated by the united states and various foreign governments including but not limited to environmental regulations and regulations implementing export license requirements and restrictions on the import or export of some technologies especially encryption technology changes in governmental regulation and our inability or failure to obtain required approvals permits or registrations could harm our international and domestic sales and adversely affect our revenues business and operations 

new regulations related to conflict minerals may force us to incur additional expenses and could limit the supply and increase the costs of certain metals and minerals used in the manufacturing of our products 

in august 2012 the sec adopted new requirements under the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 or the doddfrank act for companies that use certain minerals and derivative metals referred to as conflict minerals regardless of their country of origin in their products whether or not these products are manufactured by third parties these new requirements will require companies to perform due diligence disclose and report whether or not such minerals originate from the democratic republic of congo or adjoining countries the implementation of these new requirements could adversely affect the sourcing availability and pricing of minerals or metals used in the manufacture of our products and the numerous components that go into our products all of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results in addition we will incur additional costs to comply with the disclosure requirements including costs related to determining the source of any relevant minerals and metals used in our products we have a complex supply chain and many components are sourced through our contract manufacturer and we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins for these minerals and metals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement we may also face difficulties in satisfying customers who require that all of the components of our products be certified as conflict mineral free 

changes in financial accounting standards may cause adverse unexpected revenue fluctuations and affect our reported results of operations 

a change in accounting policies can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective new pronouncements and varying interpretations of existing pronouncements have occurred with frequency and may occur in the future changes to existing rules or changes to the interpretations of existing rules could lead to changes in our accounting practices and such changes could adversely affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business 

we may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities 

our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely affected by nondeductible stockbased compensation changes in the research and development tax credit laws earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and being higher than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates transfer pricing adjustments not meeting the terms and conditions of tax holidays or incentives changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in actual results versus our estimates or changes in tax laws regulations accounting principles or interpretations thereof in addition like other companies we may be subject to examination of our income tax returns by the us internal revenue service and other tax authorities while we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes from such examinations and the adequacy of our provision for income taxes there can be no assurance that such provision is sufficient and that a determination by a tax authority will not have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

acquisitions present many risks and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that are contemplated at the time of the transaction 

with respect to our past acquisitions as well as any other future acquisitions we may undertake we may find that the acquired businesses products or technologies do not further our business strategy as expected that we paid more than what the assets are later worth or that economic conditions change all of which may generate future impairment charges our acquisitions may be viewed negatively by customers financial markets or investors there may be difficulty integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired business and we may have difficulty retaining the key personnel of the acquired business we may have difficulty in integrating the acquired technologies or products with our existing product lines our ongoing business and management’s attention may be disrupted or diverted by transition or integration issues and the complexity of managing geographically and culturally diverse locations we may have difficulty maintaining uniform standards controls procedures and policies across locations we may experience significant problems or liabilities associated with product quality technology and other matters 

our inability to successfully operate and integrate newlyacquired businesses appropriately effectively and in a timely manner or to retain key personnel of any acquired business could have a material adverse effect on our ability to take advantage of further growth in demand for integrated traffic management and security solutions and other advances in technology as well as on our revenues gross margins and expenses 

our success depends on our key personnel and our ability to hire retain and motivate qualified sales and marketing operations product development and professional services personnel 

our success depends in large part on our ability to attract engage retain and integrate qualified executives and other key employees throughout all areas of our business in order to attract and retain executives and other key employees in a competitive marketplace we must provide a competitive compensation package including cash and equitybased compensation if we do not obtain the stockholder approval needed to continue granting equity compensation in a competitive manner our ability to attract retain and motivate executives and key employees could be weakened failure to successfully hire executives and key employees or the loss of any executives and key employees could have a significant impact on our operations further changes in our management team may be disruptive to our business and any failure to successfully integrate key new hires or promoted employees could adversely affect our business and results of operations the complexity of our application delivery networking products and their integration into existing networks and ongoing support as well as the sophistication of our sales and marketing effort requires us to retain highly trained developers professional services customer support and sales personnel competition for qualified developers professional services customer support and sales personnel in our industry is intense because of the limited number of people available with the necessary technical skills and understanding of our products our ability to hire and retain these personnel may be adversely affected by volatility or reductions in the price of our common stock since these employees are generally granted restricted stock units the loss of services of any of our key personnel the inability to retain and attract qualified personnel in the future or delays in hiring qualified personnel may harm our business and results of operations 

we face litigation risks 

we are a party to lawsuits in the normal course of our business litigation in general and intellectual property and securities litigation in particular can be expensive lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations moreover the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict responding to lawsuits has been and will likely continue to be expensive and timeconsuming for us an unfavorable resolution of these lawsuits could adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

antitakeover provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us 

our board of directors has the authority to issue up to 10000000 shares of preferred stock and to determine the price rights preferences privileges and restrictions including voting rights of those shares without any further vote or action by the shareholders the rights of the holders of common stock may be subject to and may be adversely affected by the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future the issuance of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a change of control of our company without further action by our shareholders and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of the holders of common stock further certain provisions of our bylaws including a provision limiting the ability of shareholders to raise matters at a meeting of shareholders without giving advance notice may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or management of our company which could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock in addition our articles of incorporation currently provide for a staggered board which may make it more difficult for a third party to gain control of our board of directors similarly state antitakeover laws in the state of washington related to corporate takeovers may prevent or delay a change of control of our company 

our business is subject to the risks of earthquakes fire power outages floods and other catastrophic events and to interruption by manmade problems such as terrorism 

a significant natural disaster such as an earthquake fire a flood or significant power outage could have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition we have an administrative and product development office and a third party contract manufacturer located in the san francisco bay area a region known for seismic activity in addition natural disasters could affect our supply chain manufacturing vendors or logistics providers’ ability to provide materials and perform services such as manufacturing products or assisting with shipments on a timely basis in the event our or our service providers’ information technology systems or manufacturing or logistics abilities are hindered by any of the events discussed above shipments could be delayed resulting in missed financial targets such as revenue and shipment targets for a particular quarter in addition cyberattacks acts of terrorism or other geopolitical unrest could cause disruptions in our business or the business of our supply chain manufacturers logistics providers partners or endcustomers or the economy as a whole any disruption in the business of our supply chain manufacturers logistics providers partners or endcustomers that impacts sales at the end of a fiscal quarter could have a significant adverse impact on our quarterly results all of the aforementioned risks may be further increased if the disaster recovery plans for us and our suppliers prove to be inadequate to the extent that any of the above should result in delays or cancellations of customer orders or the delay in the manufacture deployment or shipment of our products our business financial condition and operating results would be adversely affected

our management team monitors and analyzes a number of key performance indicators in order to manage our business and evaluate our financial and operating performance those indicators include

 critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements 

revenue recognition we sell products through distributors resellers and directly to end users revenue is recognized provided that all of the following criteria have been met 

 revenue from the sale of products is generally recognized when the product has been shipped and the customer is obligated to pay for the product when rights of return are present and we cannot estimate returns revenue is recognized when such rights of return lapse in certain regions where we do not have the ability to reasonably estimate returns we defer revenue on sales to our distributors until information is received from the channel partner indicating that the product has been sold to the enduser customer payment terms to domestic customers are generally net 30 days to net 45 days payment terms to international customers range from net 30 days to net 120 days based on normal and customary trade practices in the individual markets we offer extended payment terms to certain customers in which case revenue is recognized when payments are due 

revenues for postcontract customer support pcs are recognized on a straightline basis over the service contract term pcs includes a limited period of telephone support updates repair or replacement of any failed product or component that fails during the term of the agreement bug fixes and rights to upgrades when and if available consulting services are customarily billed at fixed hourly rates plus outofpocket expenses and revenues are recognized when the consulting has been completed training revenue is recognized when the training has been completed 

arrangement consideration is first allocated between software consisting of nonessential and standalone software and nonsoftware deliverables the majority of our products are hardware appliances which contain software essential to the overall functionality of the products hardware appliances are generally sold with pcs and on occasion with consulting andor training services arrangement consideration in such multiple element transactions is allocated to each element based on a fair value hierarchy where the selling price for an element is based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe if available thirdparty evidence tpe if available and vsoe is not available or the best estimate of selling price besp if neither vsoe or tpe is available 

for software deliverables we allocate revenue between multiple elements based on software revenue recognition guidance software revenue recognition guidance requires revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements to be allocated to each element based on the relative fair values of those elements the fair value of an element must be based on vsoe where fair value of delivered elements is not available revenue is recognized on the “residual method” based on the fair value of undelivered elements if evidence of fair value of one or more undelivered elements does not exist all revenue is deferred and recognized at the earlier of the delivery of those elements or the establishment of fair value of the remaining undelivered elements 

we establish vsoe for our products pcs consulting and training services based on the sales price charged for each element when sold separately the sales price is discounted from the applicable list price based on various factors including the type of customer volume of sales geographic region and program level our list prices are generally not fair value as discounts may be given based on the factors enumerated above we use historical sales transactions to determine whether vsoe can be established for each of the elements in most instances vsoe of fair value is the sales price of actual standalone unbundled transactions within the past 12 month period when a substantial majority of transactions more than 80 are priced within a narrow range which we have determined to be plus or minus 15 of the median sales price 

we believe that the vsoe of fair value of training and consulting services is represented by the billable rate per hour based on the rates charged to customers when they purchase standalone training or consulting services the price of consulting services is not based on the type of customer volume of sales geographic region or program level 

we are typically not able to determine vsoe or tpe for our nonsoftware products tpe is determined based on competitor prices for similar elements when sold separately generally our gotomarket strategy differs from that of other competitive products or services in its markets and our offerings contain a significant level of differentiation such that the comparable pricing of products with similar functionality cannot be obtained furthermore we are unable to reliably determine the selling prices on a standalone basis of similar products offered by its competitors 

when we are unable to establish selling price using vsoe or tpe we use besp in the allocation of arrangement consideration the objective of besp is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a standalone basis we have been able to establish besp through the list price less a discount deemed appropriate to maintain a reasonable gross margin management regularly reviews the gross margin information nonsoftware product besp is determined through our review of historical sales transactions within the past 12 month period additional factors considered in determining an appropriate besp include but are not limited to cost of products pricing practices geographies customer classes and distribution channels 

we regularly validate the vsoe of fair value and besp for elements in our multiple element arrangements we account for taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities on a net basis and excluded these amounts from revenues 

reserve for doubtful accounts estimates are used in determining our allowance for doubtful accounts and are based upon an assessment of selected accounts and as a percentage of our remaining accounts receivable by aging category in determining these percentages we evaluate historical writeoffs current trends in the credit quality of our customer base as well as changes in the credit policies we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition and do not require any collateral if there is deterioration of a major customer’s credit worthiness or actual defaults are higher than our historical experience our allowance for doubtful accounts may not be sufficient 

reserve for product returns in some instances product revenue from distributors is subject to agreements allowing rights of return product returns are estimated based on historical experience and are recorded at the time revenues are recognized accordingly we reduce recognized revenue for estimated future returns at the time revenue is recorded when rights of return are present and we cannot estimate returns revenue is recognized when such rights lapse the estimates for returns are adjusted periodically based upon changes in historical rates of returns and other related factors it is possible that these estimates will change in the future or that the actual amounts could vary from our estimates 

accounting for income taxes we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure including assessing the risks associated with tax audits together with assessing temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities due to the evolving nature and complexity of tax rules combined with the large number of jurisdictions in which we operate it is possible that our estimates of our tax liability could change in the future which may result in additional tax liabilities and adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

stockbased compensation we account for stockbased compensation using the straightline attribution method for recognizing compensation expense over the requisite service period of the related award we recognized 1042 million  and 953 million  of stockbased compensation expense for the years ended september 30 2013  and 2012  respectively as of september 30 2013  there was 825 million  of total unrecognized stockbased compensation cost the majority of which will be recognized over the next two  years going forward stockbased compensation expenses may increase as we issue additional equitybased awards to continue to attract and retain key employees 

we issue incentive awards to our employees through stockbased compensation consisting of restricted stock units rsus the value of rsus is determined using the fair value method which in this case is based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock on the date of grant 

we recognize compensation expense for only the portion of rsus that are expected to vest therefore we apply estimated forfeiture rates that are derived from historical employee termination behavior based on historical differences with forfeitures of stockbased awards granted to our executive officers and board of directors versus grants awarded to all other employees we developed separate forfeiture expectations for these two groups in fiscal year 2013  the estimated forfeiture rate for grants awarded to our executive officers and board of directors was approximately 7  and the estimated forfeiture rate for grants awarded to all other employees was approximately 8  if the actual number of forfeitures differs from those estimated by management additional adjustments to stockbased compensation expense may be required in future periods 

we recognize compensation costs for awards with performance conditions when we conclude it is probable that the performance condition will be achieved we reassess the probability of vesting at each balance sheet date and adjust compensation costs based on our probability assessment 

common stock repurchase on april 24 2013 we announced that our board of directors authorized an additional 200 million for our common stock share repurchase program this new authorization is incremental to the existing 600 million program initially approved in october 2010 and expanded in august 2011 and october 2011 acquisitions for the share repurchase programs will be made from time to time in private transactions or open market purchases as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements the programs can be terminated at any time as of november 15 2013  we had repurchased and retired 12289015  shares at an average price of 7218  per share and we had 1125 million  remaining to purchase shares as part of our repurchase programs 

goodwill and intangible assets goodwill represents the excess purchase price over the estimated fair value of net assets acquired as of the acquisition date we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests when impairment indicators are identified and goodwill is written down when impaired goodwill was recorded in connection with the acquisition of versafe ltd in september 2013 linerate systems inc in february 2013 traffix systems in fiscal year 2012 acopia networks inc in fiscal year 2007 swan labs inc in fiscal year 2006 magnifire websystems inc in fiscal year 2004 and uroam inc in fiscal year 2003 for our annual goodwill impairment test we operate under one reporting unit and the fair value of the reporting unit is determined by the company’s enterprise value we perform our annual goodwill impairment test during the second fiscal quarter 

as part of the annual goodwill impairment test we first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary if as a result of its qualitative assessment it is morelikelythannot ie greater than 50 chance that the fair value of our reporting unit is less than its carrying amount the quantitative impairment test will be required otherwise no further testing will be required 

examples of events and circumstances that might indicate that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount include macroeconomic conditions such as deterioration in the entity’s operating environment or industry or market considerations entityspecific events such as increasing costs declining financial performance or loss of key personnel or other events such as an expectation that a reporting unit will be sold or a sustained decrease in the stock price on either an absolute basis or relative to peers 

if it is determined as a result of the qualitative assessment that it is morelikelythannot that the fair value of our reporting unit is less than its carrying amount the provisions of authoritative guidance require that we perform a twostep impairment test on goodwill the first step of the test identifies whether potential impairment may have occurred while the second step of the test measures the amount of the impairment if any impairment is recognized when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its fair value in march 2013 we completed a qualitative assessment of potential impairment indicators and concluded that it was morelikelythannot that the fair value of our reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount 

acquired inprocess research and development iprd are intangible assets initially recognized at fair value and classified as indefinitelived assets until the successful completion or abandonment of the associated research and development efforts during the development period these assets will not be amortized as charges to earnings instead these assets will be tested for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if impairment indicators are identified iprd was recorded in connection with the acquisition of linerate systems inc in february 2013 

investments our investments are diversified among highcredit quality debt securities in accordance with our investment policy we classify our investments as availableforsale which are reported at fair market value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss in stockholders’ equity realized gains and losses and declines in value of these investments judged to be other than temporary are included in other income expense to date 

we have not deemed it necessary to record any charges related to otherthantemporary declines in the estimated fair values of our marketable debt securities however the fair value of our investments is subject to volatility declines in the fair value of our investments judged to be other than temporary could adversely affect our future operating results 

our investments also include auction rate securities ars that are classified as availableforsale ars are reported at fair market value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss in stockholders’ equity we believe these investments may remain illiquid for longer than twelve months and as a result we have classified these investments as longterm as of september 30 2013  we used the income approach to determine the fair value of our ars using a discounted cash flow analysis the assumptions we used in preparing the discounted cash flow model include estimates for interest rates estimates for discount rates using yields of comparable traded instruments adjusted for illiquidity and other risk factors amount of cash flows and expected holding periods for the ars

increases in commissions and personnel costs were driven by growth in sales and marketing employee headcount and increased sales volume for fiscal year 2013  over the prior year in fiscal year 2012  the increase in sales and marketing expense was also primarily due to increases in commissions and personnel costs of 589 million  compared to the prior year the increases in commissions and personnel costs were driven by growth in sales and marketing employee headcount and increased sales volume for fiscal year 2012  over the prior year sales and marketing headcount at the end of fiscal 2013  increased to 1319  from 1278  at the end of fiscal 2012  and 1080  at the end of fiscal 2011  sales and marketing expense included stockbased compensation expense of 395 million  370 million  and 347 million  for fiscal years 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively

loss on facility sublease we incurred a charge in august 2013 related to the consolidation of certain subleases at our corporate headquarters 



other income net other income net consists primarily of interest income and foreign currency transaction gains and losses other income net increased 231  in fiscal year 2013  as compared to fiscal year 2012  and decreased 414  in fiscal year 2012  as compared to fiscal year 2011  interest income was 63 million  69 million  and 81 million  for fiscal years 

2013  2012  and 2011  respectively the increase in other income net for fiscal year 2013  was primarily due to an increase in foreign currency transaction gains of 14 million  compared to the prior year the decrease in other income net for fiscal year 2012  as compared to fiscal year 2011  was primarily due to a reduction in interest income of 12 million  and foreign currency transaction losses of 24 million  

provision for income taxes we recorded a 367  provision for income taxes for fiscal year 2013  compared to 363  in fiscal year 2012  and 331  in fiscal year 2011  the increase in the effective tax rate from fiscal year 2012  to fiscal year 2013  was primarily due to the impact of foreign net operating losses foreign valuation allowances and stock compensation expense which were offset by a tax benefit from the retroactive reinstatement of the federal research and development credit effective january 1 2012 

we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized in making these determinations we consider historical and projected taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the appropriateness of a valuation allowance the net increase in the valuation allowance of 52 million  for fiscal year 2013  was primarily due to the uncertainty regarding the ability of certain foreign entities to utilize net operating losses our net deferred tax assets as of fiscal year end 2013  and 2012  were 334 million  and 458 million  respectively 

our worldwide effective tax rate may fluctuate based on a number of factors including variations in projected taxable income in the various geographic locations in which we operate changes in the valuation of our net deferred tax assets resolution of potential exposures tax positions taken on tax returns filed in the various geographic locations in which we operate and the introduction of new accounting standards or changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof in the various geographic locations in which we operate we have recorded liabilities to address potential tax exposures related to business and income tax positions we have taken that could be challenged by taxing authorities the ultimate resolution of these potential exposures may be greater or less than the liabilities recorded which could result in an adjustment to our future tax expense 

liquidity and capital resources 

we have funded our operations with our cash balances cash generated from operations and proceeds from public offerings of our securities 

  



cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and longterm investments totaled 12711 million  as of september 30 2013  compared to 11950 million  as of september 30 2012  representing an increase of 761 million  the increase was primarily due to cash provided by operating activities of 4997 million  for fiscal year 2013  compared to 4954 million  for fiscal year 2012  which was partially offset by 2000 million  of additional cash required for the repurchase of outstanding common stock under our share repurchase program in fiscal 2013  the increase in cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year 2013 was also partially offset by 1249  million for the acquisition of linerate systems and 877  million for the acquisition of versafe in fiscal year 2012  the increase was primarily due to cash provided by operating activities of 4954 million  compared to 4169 million  for fiscal year 2011  which was partially offset by 1848 million  of additional cash required for the repurchase of outstanding common stock under our share repurchase program in fiscal 2012  and 1283 million  for the acquisition of traffix systems 

cash provided by operating activities during fiscal year 2013  was 4997 million  compared to 4954 million  in fiscal year 2012  and 4169 million  in fiscal year 2011  cash provided by operating activities resulted primarily from cash generated from net income after adjusting for noncash charges such as stockbased compensation depreciation and amortization charges and changes in operating assets and liabilities 

cash used in investing activities during fiscal year 2013  was 3525 million  compared to 3523 million  in fiscal year 2012  and 1397 million  in fiscal year 2011  cash used in investing activities for fiscal year 2013  was primarily the result of the purchase of investments and capital expenditures related to maintaining our operations worldwide partially offset by the sale and maturity of investments and 2126 million  for the linerate systems and versafe acquisitions cash used in investing activities for fiscal year 2012  was primarily the result of the purchase of investments and capital expenditures related to maintaining our operations worldwide partially offset by the sale and maturity of investments and 1283 million  for the acquisition of traffix systems cash used in investing activities for fiscal year 2011  was primarily the result of the purchase of investments and capital expenditures related to maintaining our operations worldwide partially offset by the sale and maturity of investments 

cash used in financing activities was 1663 million  for fiscal year 2013  compared to 1492 million  for fiscal year 2012  and 2267 million  for fiscal year 2011  cash used in financing activities for fiscal year 2013  included 2000 million  to repurchase common stock under our share repurchase program which was partially offset by cash received from the exercise of employee stock options and stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan of 296 million  and excess tax benefits related to sharebased compensation of 41 million  cash used in financing activities for fiscal year 2012  included 1848 million  to repurchase common stock under our share repurchase program which was partially offset by cash received from the exercise of employee stock options and stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan of 252 million  and excess tax benefits related to sharebased compensation of 104 million  cash used in financing activities for fiscal 2011  included 2715 million  to repurchase common stock under our share repurchase program which was partially offset by cash received from the exercise of employee stock options and stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan of 212 million  and excess tax benefits related to sharebased compensation of 236 million  

based on our current operating and capital expenditure forecasts we believe that our existing cash and investment balances excluding auction rate securities together with cash generated from operations should be sufficient to meet our operating requirements for the next twelve months our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our rate of revenue growth the expansion of our sales and marketing activities the timing and extent of expansion into new territories the timing of introductions of new products and enhancements of existing products and the continuing market acceptance of our products 

obligations and commitments 

the following table summarizes our contractual payment obligations and commitments as of september 30 2013  

  



we lease our facilities under operating leases that expire at various dates through 2023  

as of september 30 2013  we had approximately 77 million  of tax liabilities including interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions see note 6 to our consolidated financial statements because of the high degree of uncertainty regarding the settlement of these liabilities we are unable to estimate the years in which future cash outflows may occur 

purchase obligations are comprised of purchase commitments with our contract manufacturers the agreement with our primary contract manufacturer allows it to procure component inventory on our behalf based on our production forecast we are obligated to purchase component inventory that the contract manufacturer procures in accordance with the forecast unless cancellation is given within applicable lead times 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in february 2013 the fasb issued asu 20132 comprehensive income topic 220 reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income  asu 20132 to improve the reporting of reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income asu 20132 requires presentation either on the face of the financial statements or in the notes of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component and by net income line item asu 20132 is effective prospectively for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december 15 2012 we will adopt asu 20132 in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 and do not expect the adoption of this standard to have an impact on our consolidated financial statements

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

tableend interest rate risk our cash equivalents consist of highquality securities as specified in our investment policy guidelines the policy limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue or issuer to a maximum of 5  of the total portfolio with the exception of us treasury and agency securities commercial paper and money market funds which are exempt from size limitation the policy requires investments in securities that mature in three years or less with the average maturity being no greater than one and a half years these securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if interest rates increase a decrease of one percent in the average interest rate would have resulted in a decrease of approximately 68 million  in our interest income for the fiscal year 2013  

  



at september 30 2013  the fair value of our aaaa or equivalent rated municipal ars was approximately 30 million  ars are collateralized longterm debt instruments that provide liquidity through a dutch auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at predetermined intervals typically every 7 28 or 35 days based on our expected operating cash flows and our other sources of cash we do not believe that any reduction in liquidity of our municipal ars will have a material impact on our overall ability to meet our liquidity needs we have no intent to sell will not be required to sell and believe we will hold these securities until recovery we believe certain of these availableforsale investments may remain illiquid for longer than twelve months and as a result we have classified 33 million  par value of securities as longterm as of september 30 2013  

foreign currency risk the majority of our sales and expenses are denominated in us dollars and as a result we have not experienced significant foreign currency transaction gains and losses to date while we have conducted some transactions in foreign currencies during the fiscal year ended september 30 2013  and expect to continue to do so we do not anticipate that foreign currency transaction gains or losses will be significant at our current level of operations however as we continue to expand our operations internationally transaction gains or losses may become significant in the future we have not engaged in foreign currency hedging to date however we may do so in the future

 item 1 business tableend general 

f5 networks is a leading provider of application delivery networking adn technology that secures and optimizes the delivery of networkbased applications and the security performance and availability of servers and other network resources as strategic points of control within and between networks our products collectively create a dynamic control plane that simplifies connecting users to applications in the fastest most secure and highly available way possible our approach reduces the complexity and cost of data center operations whether our customers have a traditional data center or have a private cloud public cloud or hybrid approach 

our principal products are application delivery controllers adcs that include our bigip family of appliances and our line of scalable viprion systems these products are typically deployed in front of web and application servers balancing traffic and performing computeintensive functions such as encrypting and unencrypting transmissions screening traffic for security threats maintaining open connections with servers 

  

speeding the flow of traffic managing access to applications and data and a variety of other functions that improve the security performance and availability of applications we also offer virtual editions software only versions of our adn software referred to as ves that can run on physical or virtual servers and allow our customers to deploy our products in virtualized and cloud environments 

by offloading functions from servers our bigip and viprion products make servers more efficient reduce the number of servers needed to run specific applications lower the cost of power and cooling and drive down operating costs by simplifying the management of servers and applications in virtual environments this allows customers to increase the density of virtual servers running on physical servers and reduces the added complexity of managing a dynamic environment 

the core of our adn technology is our fullproxy traffic management operating system tmos that enables our products to inspect and modify the content of ip traffic flows to and from servers at network speed and supports a broad and growing array of functions that enhance the security performance and availability of applications irules a scripting language based on tool command language tcl is a unique feature of tmos that enables customers and third parties to write customized rules to inspect and modify traffic tmos also supports a common software interface called icontrol which enables our products to communicate with one another and with thirdparty products including custom and commercial enterprise applications tmos is designed to support the addition of new functionality as software modules and to exploit the performanceenhancing features of our purposebuilt hardware platforms correspondingly our hardware architecture integrates industry standard components with components we design ourselves to optimize tmos and deliver performance that is demonstrably superior to competing products 

just as our adcs make many servers look like one our arx storage virtualization products sit in front of network attached storage nas making multiple storage devices from different vendors look like a single device to the individual clients servers and applications that use them in addition arx products simplify the migration of data between storage devices the addition of new storage devices and the distribution of files across tiers of storage including cloud storage services that reflect their relative immediacy or importance 

in february 2012 we expanded our capabilities in the service provider market with the acquisition of traffix systems a pioneer and industry leader in diameter signaling technology diameter is the protocol used to control traffic for the new generation of mobile networks 

in connection with our products we offer a broad range of services including consulting training installation maintenance and other technical support services

industry background 

growth and evolution of ipbased infrastructures 

internet protocol ip is a communications language used to transmit data over the internet for more than two decades large business and government organizations have been gradually replacing older data center architectures with ipbased infrastructures deploying new ipbased applications and replacing or upgrading legacy applications with new ipenabled versions at the same time organizations have become more 

  

geographically dispersed and increasingly mobile workforces depend on access to corporate applications and data from remote locations and a variety of client devices including smartphones tablets and laptops 

within the past three years the information technology landscape has changed dramatically as organizations have responded to the slowdown in the global economy by using technologies such as virtualization and the growing availability and sophistication of cloud computing to reduce capital and operating costs and enhance the flexibility and efficiency of their information infrastructures these efforts are reflected in the ongoing trend toward data center consolidation that includes a reduction in both the number and size of data centers in addition a growing number of organizations are turning to social networking and other online vehicles to help target customers and compete more effectively in an environment of reduced consumer spending the rapid growth of social networks such as facebook and twitter coupled with the explosion of mobile devices and applications has challenged the abilities of content and service providers to keep up with and monetize the growing demand for ipbased services 

along with the growth of internet traffic the proliferation of unstructured data such as voice video images email spreadsheets and formatted text files continues to present an enormous and increasing challenge to it organizations historically it organizations have responded to this challenge primarily by adding more storage file virtualization is a relatively new technology that enables organizations to store and manage files across a heterogeneous array of storage devices and lower their overall cost of storage 

emergence of the dynamic data center 

from a broad perspective the goal of it organizations is to optimize the secure delivery of applications and data to users wherever they are and whenever they need them to achieve these goals it organizations are embracing virtualization technologies that enable them to group or partition data center resources to meet user demand and reconfigure these virtual resources easily and quickly as demand changes the recent surge of interest in software defined networks highlights the latest move to reduce costs increase the flexibility and simplify the deployment and management of it infrastructure through virtualization many organizations are also taking advantage of the growing availability of external cloud resources as a flexible secure and reliable alternative to owning and managing everything themselves as a result it infrastructure has become increasingly dynamic complex and reliant on ipbased networks for the delivery of applications and data at the same time these changes have created new challenges to the security of ip networks and the applications and data accessible over the internet within the past year sophisticated denial of service attacks have exposed a major vulnerability in the security perimeter of corporate networks by overwhelming firewalls and effectively shutting down the networks in addition many networklevel security threats are directly related to the improper use of the same protocols applications depend on to transmit data over the wire intrusion detection and prevention devices which rely on signature databases of known threats afford some protection against these types of attack however they offer no protection against many of the most common threats including information leakage content spoofing crosssite request forgery or “day zero” attacks designed to exploit a variety of application vulnerabilities 

in addition to preventing the threat of attacks designed to disrupt destroy or block access to network applications organizations are faced with the equally daunting challenge of controlling access to applications and data the proliferation of mobile devices has given users with smart phones tablets and laptops the ability to access corporate data centers from virtually anywhere this in turn has increased the difficulty of ensuring that mobile users are able to access applications and data for which they are authorized and that applications and data are protected from access by unauthorized users 

need to optimize the secure delivery of applications and data 

with the ongoing evolution and increasing complexity of it infrastructures there is a growing need to optimize the secure delivery of applications and data over ip networks ipbased traffic passing between client 

  

devices and servers is divided into discrete packets that travel by multiple routes to their destination where they are reassembled the disassembly routing and reassembly of transmissions are relatively straightforward and require little intelligence by contrast managing inspecting modifying redirecting and securing application traffic going to and from servers requires intelligent systems capable of performing a broad array of functions broadly speaking all of those functions are aspects of application delivery networking 

adcs dynamically manage the flow of traffic between users and servers physical or virtual making them look like a single resource to the user in addition they free up resources by offloading common network functions such as encryption ipv4ipv6 translation compression authentication rateshaping and a variety of specialized functions including network and application security services policy management and wan optimization that would otherwise run on the servers or be coded into the applications since most large enterprises have hundreds — if not thousands — of servers and applications it is not practical to replicate these functions on each server or within each virtual instance of an application doing so would take up valuable network resources and reduce the number of applications that could run on each server maintenance costs would be prohibitive and the net result would be a negative impact on the overall performance of servers and applications offloading specific functions onto point solutions can eliminate those problems but introduces a new set of challenges using point solutions from multiple vendors can create interoperability issues and problems that do occur can be difficult to troubleshoot from a security standpoint it is also much more difficult to audit traffic passing through multiple devices providing a comprehensive set of integrated application delivery features and functions on a single highperformance platform simplifies management of the device and the servers it sits in front of and reduces overall capital and operating costs file virtualization delivers similar benefits by reducing the cost and complexity of file storage 

along with other types of ip traffic the volume of filebased information created and accessed by internet users and network applications is growing rapidly file virtualization allows it organizations to map individual users and applications to a single device that can distribute files across a heterogeneous array of storage devices keep track of their location and retrieve them as needed file virtualization devices maximize storage utilization and simplify the migration of data from one vendor’s storage devices to another’s they can also be programmed to allocate files across tiers of storage systems matching the cost capacity and performance of the storage devices to the type of information being stored frequency of usage and relative importance substantially reducing both the capital and operating costs associated with file storage 

f5’s strategy 

our goal is to lead the industry in delivering network architectures that integrate ip networks with applications and data enabling the delivery of dynamic services in the data center those services include security optimization and orchestration of data center operations and resources as well as coordination of services spanning multiple data centers our products are designed to be strategic points of control in the it infrastructure that allow business policies to be implemented where information is exchanged this enables organizations to respond quickly to changing business needs improve costly and time consuming business processes and develop new sources of revenue through highly differentiated offerings key components of our strategy include 

offering a complete integrated application delivery product suite 

since the introduction of our tmos architecture for application delivery networking we have developed tmosbased versions of our own legacy products such as local traffic manager ltm global traffic manager gtm and link controller and acquired technology including application security manager asm webaccelerator wan optimization module wom edge gateway and application policy manager apm all of these products are currently available as integrated software modules on our bigip family of adcs we believe this approach sharply differentiates our products from our competitors’ offerings and provides customers 

  

with an expanding array of integrated application delivery networking solutions that can be customized to meet their specific needs 

investing in technology to meet evolving customer needs 

we continue to invest in research and development to provide our customers with comprehensive integrated solutions in application delivery networking our product development efforts leverage the unique attributes of our softwarebased platforms to deliver new features and functions that address the complex changing needs of our customers although the bulk of our investment in application delivery and file virtualization technologies is software development concurrent development of tightly integrated highperformance hardware is a key part of our investment strategy we also look for opportunities to acquire technologies that will enable us to broaden the scope of our offerings and expand into adjacent markets 

expanding our addressable market 

since the introduction of tmos we have continually expanded our addressable market and the definition of application delivery through the acquisition and development of new technology in 2003 for example we entered the market for secure remote access through the acquisition of uroam inc and its firepass ssl vpn technology that has become the core of our current apm offering the following year we entered the web application firewall market with the acquisition of magnifire websystems inc and its trafficshield security appliance which became the foundation of our application security module asm as we developed these security modules we leveraged the full proxy capabilities of tmos to enhance and add new security features to our ltm product and in january 2012 we received certification of bigip ltm from icsa labs as a network firewall while each of these products address a different element of the broader security market they are all integral components of our comprehensive security offering and tightly integrated with ltm and the other features and functions available on our adc products as a result of this strategy and our development and acquisition of technology in other related markets such as wan optimization diameter switching and routing and classification we believe our current addressable market is significantly larger than the adc market as it has been traditionally defined by industry analysts 

continuing to build and expand relationships with strategic technology partners 

to compete successfully against cisco systems inc and other large competitors who have an established presence in our target accounts we have developed strategic technology partnerships with enterprise software vendors such as microsoft oracle vmware and others who often have an established or growing presence in those accounts by taking advantage of our open application programming interface called icontrol these vendors can equip their applications to control our products in the network enhancing overall application performance in return they provide us significant leverage in the selling process by recommending our products to their customers we have also worked closely with several of these vendors to develop configurations of our products called iapps that are specifically designed to simplify deployment and optimize the performance of their applications these solutions are available as templates which allow quick and easy configuration of our products for specific applications we plan to continue building on our existing relationships and to extend our competitive edge by developing new strategic partnerships with other technology leaders including providers of software defined networking solutions 

leveraging devcentral our online community of network architects and developers 

customization of our products using irules enhances their “stickiness” by allowing customers to solve problems in both their applications and their networks that would be difficult if not impossible to solve by other means to promote the use of irules we host an online community devcentral where network architects and developers can discuss and share the ways in which they use irules to solve problems and enhance the security performance and availability of applications a corollary benefit is that many of the irules solutions posted by 

  

devcentral participants have become standard features in new releases of tmos devcentral also provides a valuable window into our customers’ constantly evolving needs 

f5 solutions 

we design integrated software products that run on purposebuilt hardware and are also available as virtual software only editions our products function as strategic points of control in ip networks inspecting modifying and directing traffic to optimize the security availability and delivery of applications and data to any user anywhere we believe our products offer the most intelligent architecture and advanced functionality in the marketplace along with performance and flexibility that enable organizations to simplify management of their data center operations and integrate disparate resources to reduce operating costs enhance productivity and improve service to employees customers and partners

to enable our customers to take advantage of inexpensive cloud storage alternatives we offer arx cloud extender a software solution that works in concert with the automated storage tiering capabilities of arx to extend the file storage infrastructure seamlessly from the data center to the cloud 

product development 

we believe our future success depends on our ability to maintain technology leadership by continuing to improve our products and by developing new products to meet the changing needs of our customers our product development organization employs a standard process for the development documentation and quality control of software and systems that is designed to meet these goals this process includes working with our business development and marketing teams product managers customers and partners to identify new or improved solutions that meet the evolving needs of our addressable markets 

  

our principal software engineering team is located in our headquarters in seattle washington product development for firepass apm wom and webaccelerator is located in san jose california asm and traffix sdc product development is located in tel aviv israel arx product development is located in lowell massachusetts our hardware engineering team is located in spokane washington in addition we maintain a dedicated facility for product testing and quality control in tomsk russia members of all our product development teams collaborate closely with one another to ensure the interoperability and performance of our hardware and software systems 

during the fiscal years ended september 30 2012 2011 and 2010 we had research and product development expenses of 1774 million 1389 million and 1183 million respectively 

customers 

our customers include a wide variety of enterprise customers and service providers among fortune 1000 and business week global 1000 companies including those in technology telecommunications financial services transportation education manufacturing and healthcare along with government customers in fiscal year 2012 sales outside of the americas represented 424 of our net revenues refer to note 10 of our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding our revenues by geographic area 

sales and marketing 

sales 

we sell our products and services to large enterprise customers and service providers through a variety of channels including distributors valueadded resellers vars and systems integrators a substantial amount of our revenue for fiscal year 2012 was derived from these channel sales our sales teams work closely with our channel partners and also sell our products and services directly to major accounts 

f5 sales teams our inside sales team generates and qualifies leads for regional sales managers and helps manage accounts by serving as a liaison between the field and internal corporate resources our field sales personnel are located in major cities in four sales regions the americas primarily the united states europe the middle east and africa emea japan and the asia pacific region apac field sales personnel work closely with our channel partners to assist them as necessary in the sale of our products and services to their customers we also sell our products and services directly to customers primarily large enterprises whose accounts are managed by our major account services team field systems engineers support our regional sales managers and channel partners by participating in joint sales calls and providing presale technical resources as needed 

distributors and vars as a key component of our sales strategy we have established relationships with a number of large national and international distributors local and specialized distributors and vars we derive a majority of our product sales from these distributors and vars 

our agreements with these channel partners are not exclusive and do not prevent them from selling competitive products these agreements typically have terms of one year with no obligation to renew and typically do not provide for exclusive sales territories or minimum purchase requirements 

for fiscal year 2012 sales to two of our worldwide distributors avnet technology solutions and ingram micro inc represented 171 and 138 of our total revenues respectively our agreements with these distributors are standard nonexclusive distribution agreements that renew automatically on an annual basis and can be terminated by either party with 30 days prior written notice the agreements grant avnet technology solutions and ingram micro inc the right to distribute our products to resellers in north america and certain other territories internationally with no minimum purchase requirements 

  

systems integrators we also market our products through strategic relationships with systems integrators including dell services hp enterprise services and ibm global services who include our products as core components of application or networkbased solutions they deploy for their customers in most cases systems integrators do not directly purchase our products for resale to their customers instead they typically recommend our products as part of broader solutions such as enterprise resource planning erp or customer relationship management crm solutions that incorporate our products for high availability and enhanced performance 

marketing 

our marketing strategy is driven by the belief that our continued success depends on our ability to understand and anticipate the dynamic needs of our addressable markets and to develop valuable solutions that meet those needs in line with this belief our marketing organization works directly with customers partners and our product development teams to identify and create innovative solutions to further enhance our leadership position in addition our business development team which is a component of our marketing organization closely monitors technology companies in adjacent and complementary markets for opportunities to acquire or partner with those whose solutions are complementary to ours and could enable us to expand our addressable market 

another key component of our marketing strategy is to develop and expand our icontrol partnerships working closely with our partners we have developed customizable solutions templates called iapps that help ensure the successful deployment and delivery of their applications over the network these solution templates have been integrated into tmos version 11 and allow customers to configure our products quickly and easily to optimize the performance of specific applications from major software vendors such as microsoft oracle vmware and others 

to support the growing number of developers using our products including network and application architects we continue to promote and expand devcentral our online community website that provides technical resources to customers prospects and partners wanting to extend and optimize f5 solutions using irules a key aspect of devcentral is an online forum where developers as well as application and network architects discuss and share solutions they have written with irules at the end of fiscal year 2012 devcentral had more than 111000 registered members 

we also engage in a number of marketing programs and initiatives aimed at promoting our brand and creating market awareness of our technology and products these include actively participating in industry trade shows and joint marketing events with channel and technology partners and briefing industry analysts and members of the trade press on our latest products business relationships and technology partnerships in addition we market our products to chief information officers and other information technology professionals through targeted advertising direct mail and highprofile web events 

backlog 

at the end of fiscal years 2012 and 2011 we had product backlog of approximately 388 million and 409 million respectively backlog represents orders confirmed with a purchase order for products to be shipped generally within 90 days to customers with approved credit status orders are subject to cancellation rescheduling by customers or product specification changes by customers although we believe that the backlog orders are firm purchase orders may be cancelled by the customer prior to shipment without significant penalty for this reason we believe that our product backlog at any given date is not a reliable indicator of future revenues 

customer service and technical support 

we believe that our ability to provide consistent highquality customer service and technical support is a key factor in attracting and retaining large enterprise customers accordingly we offer a broad range of support 

  

services that include installation phone support hardware repair and replacement software updates online tools consulting and training services 

we provide these services directly to end users and also utilize a multitiered support model leveraging the capabilities of our channel partners when applicable our technical support staff is strategically located in regional service centers to support our global customer base 

prior to the installation of our products our services personnel work with customers to analyze their network needs and determine the best way to deploy our products and configure product features and functions to meet those needs our services personnel also provide onsite installation and training services to help customers make optimal use of product features and functions 

our customers typically purchase a oneyear maintenance contract which entitles them to an array of services provided by our technical support team maintenance services provided under the contract include online updates software error correction releases hardware repair and replacement and in the majority of cases roundtheclock call center support free updates of our software are available to customers with a current maintenance contract our technical support team also offers seminars and training classes for customers on the configuration and use of products including local and wide area network system administration and management in addition we have a professional services team able to provide a full range of feebased consulting services including comprehensive network management documentation and performance analysis and capacity planning to assist in predicting future network requirements 

as part of our maintenance service we offer an online automated selfhelp customer support function called “ask f5” that provides answers to many commonly asked questions allowing customers to get information and solve problems quickly while significantly reducing the number of calls to our support desk this enables us to provide comprehensive customer support while keeping our supportrelated expenses at a manageable consistent level we also offer an online service called ihealth which allows customers to diagnose uptotheminute snapshots of their bigip systems diagnoses include tailored feedback about configuration issues or code defects a description of the issue recommendations for resolution and a link to further information in the askf5™ knowledge base 

manufacturing 

we outsource the manufacturing of our preconfigured hardware platforms to third party contract manufacturers for assembly according to our specifications 

flextronics manufactures our adc product line and sanminasci manufactures our arx product line the subcontracting activity at flextronics and sanminasci encompasses prototype builds full production and direct fulfillment our contract manufacturers perform the following activities on our behalf material procurement pcb assembly and test final assembly system test quality control direct shipment and warranty repairs we provide a rolling forecast that allows our contract manufacturers to stock component parts and other materials plan capacity and build finished goods inventory in anticipation of end user demand each of the contract manufacturers procures components in volumes consistent with our forecast necessary to assemble the products and tests the products according to our specifications products are then shipped to our distributors valueadded resellers or end users generally we do not own the components title to the products transfers from the contract manufacturers to us and then to our customers upon delivery at a designated shipment location if the components are unused or the products are not sold within specified periods of time we may incur carrying charges or obsolete material charges for components that our contract manufacturers purchased to build products to meet our forecast or customer orders 

hardware platforms for our products consist primarily of commodity parts and certain custom components designed and approved by our hardware engineering group most of our components are purchased from sources 

  

which we believe are readily available from other suppliers however several components used in the assembly of our products are purchased from a single or limited source 

during fiscal year 2010 we transitioned certain subassembly and testing processes of our bigip products from flextronics’s facilities in milpitas california to the flextronics facility in zhuhai china all subassemblies are configured and final tested at flextronics’s milpitas california for distribution to our end users 

competition 

the expanding capabilities of our product offerings have enabled us to address a growing array of market opportunities many of which are outside the bounds of the application delivery networking market as defined and measured by industry analysts such as gartner group dell’oro and others in addition to server loadbalancing and other functions normally associated with application delivery our suite of integrated product modules has expanded our addressable market into security wan optimization policy management and diameter signaling where we compete with a growing number of companies not included among traditional adc vendors the ability to create custom network services using irules has also enabled us our customers and our partners to design solutions to problems for which there is no offtheshelf solution as a result we believe the traditional definitions of our market do not encompass all of the features functions and capabilities of our products or accurately represent the addressable market for those products 

within the more narrowly defined traditional adc market several companies sell server loadbalancing products these include brocade communications systems inc cisco systems inc citrix systems inc radware ltd and a number of smaller competitors a10 networks array networks inc barracuda networks inc and riverbed technology which recently acquired zeus technology ltd 

in related adc markets we compete with the following 

 

  

  

  

  

 the principal competitive factors in the markets in which we compete include product features and performance customer support brand recognition the scope of distribution and sales channels and pricing certain of our competitors have and may in the future adopt aggressive pricing policies to gain market share however because of the superior performance broad functionality and unique capabilities of our products which have resulted in high levels of customer satisfaction and growing brand awareness we believe that we can and will compete effectively against such pricing policies 

intellectual property 

we rely on a combination of patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights we have obtained 124 patents in the united states 11 foreign patents and have applications pending for various aspects of our technology our future success depends in part on our ability to protect our proprietary rights to the technologies used in our principal products despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use trade secrets or other information that we regard as proprietary in addition the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights as fully as do the laws of the united states any issued patent may not preserve our proprietary position and competitors or others may develop technologies 

  

similar to or superior to our technology our failure to enforce and protect our intellectual property rights could harm our business operating results and financial condition 

in addition to our own proprietary software we incorporate software licensed from several thirdparty sources into our products these licenses generally renew automatically on an annual basis we believe that alternative technologies for these licenses are available both domestically and internationally 

employees 

as of september 30 2012 we had 3029 fulltime employees including 774 in product development 1278 in sales and marketing 654 in professional services and technical support and 323 in finance administration and operations none of our employees is represented by a labor union we have experienced no work stoppages and believe that our employee relations are good

 item 1a risk factors tableend in addition to the other information in this report the following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating our company and its business 

our quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate in future periods which may cause our stock price to fluctuate 

our quarterly and annual operating results have varied significantly in the past and could vary significantly in the future which makes it difficult for us to predict our future operating results our operating results may fluctuate due to a variety of factors many of which are outside of our control including the changing and recently volatile us and global economic environment which may cause our stock price to fluctuate in particular we anticipate that the size of customer orders may increase as we continue to focus on larger business accounts a delay in the recognition of revenue even from just one account may have a significant negative impact on our results of operations for a given period in the past a majority of our sales have been realized near the end of a quarter accordingly a delay in an anticipated sale past the end of a particular quarter may negatively impact our results of operations for that quarter or in some cases that fiscal year additionally we have exposure to the credit risks of some of our customers and subtenants although we have programs in place that are designed to monitor and mitigate the associated risk there can be no assurance that such programs will be effective in reducing our credit risks adequately we monitor individual payment capability in granting credit arrangements seek to limit the total credit to amounts we believe our customers can pay and maintain reserves we believe are adequate to cover exposure for potential losses if there is a deterioration of a subtenant’s or a major customer’s creditworthiness or actual defaults are higher than expected future losses if incurred could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our operating results further our operating results may be below the expectations of securities analysts and investors in future quarters or years our failure to meet these expectations will likely harm the market price of our common stock such a decline could occur and has occurred in the past even when we have met our publicly stated revenue andor earnings guidance 

in addition to other risks listed in this “risk factors” section factors that may affect our operating results include but are not limited to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

 our success depends on our timely development of new products and features market acceptance of new product offerings and proper management of the timing of the life cycle of our products 

the application delivery networking and file virtualization markets are characterized by rapid technological change frequent new product introductions changes in customer requirements and evolving industry standards our continued success depends on our ability to identify and develop new products and new features for our existing products to meet the demands of these changes and the acceptance of those products and features by our existing and target customers if we are unable to identify develop and deploy new products and new product features on a timely basis our business and results of operations may be harmed 

the current development cycle for our products is on average 1224 months the introduction of new products or product enhancements may shorten the life cycle of our existing products or replace sales of some of our current products thereby offsetting the benefit of even a successful product introduction and may cause customers to defer purchasing our existing products in anticipation of the new products this could harm our operating results by decreasing sales increasing our inventory levels of older products and exposing us to greater risk of product obsolescence we have also experienced and may in the future experience delays in developing and releasing new products and product enhancements this has led to and may in the future lead to delayed sales increased expenses and lower quarterly revenue than anticipated also in the development of our products we have experienced delays in the prototyping of our products which in turn has led to delays in product introductions in addition complexity and difficulties in managing product transitions at the endoflife stage of a product can create excess inventory of components associated with the outgoing product that can lead to increased expenses any or all of the above problems could materially harm our business and results of operations 

our success depends on sales and continued innovation of our application delivery networking product lines 

for the fiscal year ended september 30 2012 we derived approximately 986 of our net product revenues or approximately 586 of our total net revenues from sales of our application delivery networking adn product lines we expect to continue to derive a significant portion of our net revenues from sales of our adn products in the future implementation of our strategy depends upon these products being able to solve critical network availability performance and security problems for our customers if our adn products are unable to solve these problems for our customers or if we are unable to sustain the high levels of innovation in our adn product feature set needed to maintain leadership in what will continue to be a competitive market environment our business and results of operations will be harmed 

  

we may not be able to compete effectively in the emerging application delivery networking and file virtualization markets 

the markets we serve are new rapidly evolving and highly competitive and we expect competition to persist and intensify in the future our principal competitors in the application delivery networking market include brocade communications systems inc cisco systems inc citrix systems inc radware ltd and a10 networks in the adjacent wan optimization controller market we compete with blue coat systems inc cisco citrix juniper networks inc and riverbed technology inc in the file virtualization market we compete with emc corporation we expect to continue to face additional competition as new participants enter our markets as we continue to expand globally we may see new competitors in different geographic regions in addition larger companies with significant resources brand recognition and sales channels may form alliances with or acquire competing application delivery networking solutions from other companies and emerge as significant competitors potential competitors may bundle their products or incorporate an internet traffic management or security component into existing products in a manner that discourages users from purchasing our products any of these circumstances may limit our opportunities for growth and negatively impact our financial performance 

the average selling price of our products may decrease and our costs may increase which may negatively impact gross profits 

it is possible that the average selling prices of our products will decrease in the future in response to competitive pricing pressures increased sales discounts new product introductions by us or our competitors or other factors therefore in order to maintain our gross profits we must develop and introduce new products and product enhancements on a timely basis and continually reduce our product costs our failure to do so will cause our net revenue and gross profits to decline which will harm our business and results of operations in addition we may experience substantial periodtoperiod fluctuations in future operating results due to the erosion of our average selling prices 

it is difficult to predict our future operating results because we have an unpredictable sales cycle 

our products have a lengthy sales cycle and the timing of our revenue is difficult to predict historically our sales cycle has ranged from approximately two to three months and has tended to lengthen as we have increasingly focused our sales efforts on the enterprise market also as our distribution strategy has evolved into more of a channel model utilizing valueadded resellers distributors and systems integrators the level of variability in the length of sales cycle across transactions has increased and made it more difficult to predict the timing of many of our sales transactions sales of our products require us to educate potential customers in their use and benefits sales of our products are subject to delays from the lengthy internal budgeting approval and competitive evaluation processes that large corporations and governmental entities may require for example customers frequently begin by evaluating our products on a limited basis and devote time and resources to testing our products before they decide whether or not to purchase customers may also defer orders as a result of anticipated releases of new products or enhancements by our competitors or us as a result our products have an unpredictable sales cycle that contributes to the uncertainty of our future operating results 

our business may be harmed if our contract manufacturers are not able to provide us with adequate supplies of our products or if a single source of hardware assembly is lost or impaired 

we outsource the manufacturing of our hardware platforms to third party contract manufacturers who assemble these hardware platforms to our specifications we have experienced minor delays in shipments from contract manufacturers in the past however if we experience major delays in the future or other problems such as inferior quality and insufficient quantity of product any one or a combination of these factors may harm our business and results of operations the inability of our contract manufacturers to provide us with adequate supplies of our products or the loss of one or more of our contract manufacturers may cause a delay in our ability 

  

to fulfill orders while we obtain a replacement manufacturer and may harm our business and results of operations in particular we currently subcontract manufacturing of our application delivery networking products to a single contract manufacturer with whom we do not have a longterm contract if our arrangement with this single source of hardware assembly was terminated or otherwise impaired and we were not able to engage another contract manufacturer in a timely manner our business financial condition and results of operation could be adversely affected 

if the demand for our products grows we will need to increase our raw material and component purchases contract manufacturing capacity and internal test and quality control functions any disruptions in product flow may limit our revenue may harm our competitive position and may result in additional costs or cancellation of orders by our customers 

our business could suffer if there are any interruptions or delays in the supply of hardware components from our thirdparty sources 

we currently purchase several hardware components used in the assembly of our products from a number of single or limited sources lead times for these components vary significantly the unavailability of suitable components any interruption or delay in the supply of any of these hardware components or the inability to procure a similar component from alternate sources at acceptable prices within a reasonable time may delay assembly and sales of our products and hence our revenues and may harm our business and results of operations 

we are subject to governmental export and import controls that could subject us to liability or impair our ability to compete in international markets 

our products are subject to us export controls and may be exported outside the us only with the required level of export license or through an export license exception because we incorporate encryption technology into our products in addition various countries regulate the import of certain encryption technology and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute our products or our customers’ ability to implement our products in those countries changes in our products or changes in export and import regulations may create delays in the introduction of our products in international markets prevent our customers with international operations from deploying our products throughout their global systems or in some cases prevent the export or import of our products to certain countries altogether any change in export or import regulations or related legislation shift in approach to the enforcement or scope of existing regulations or change in the countries persons or technologies targeted by such regulations could result in decreased use of our products by or in our decreased ability to export or sell our products to existing or potential customers with international operations any decreased use of our products or limitation on our ability to export or sell our products would likely adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

reliance on shipments at the end of the quarter could cause our revenue for the applicable period to fall below expected levels 

as a result of customer buying patterns and the efforts of our sales force and channel partners to meet or exceed their sales objectives we have historically received a substantial portion of sales orders and generated a substantial portion of revenue during the last few weeks of each fiscal quarter in addition any significant interruption in our information technology systems which manage critical functions such as order processing revenue recognition financial forecasts inventory and supply chain management and trade compliance reviews could result in delayed order fulfillment and decreased revenue for that fiscal quarter if expected revenue at the end of any fiscal quarter is delayed for any reason including the failure of anticipated purchase orders to materialize our third party contract manufacturers’ inability to manufacture and ship products prior to fiscal quarterend to fulfill purchase orders received near the end of the fiscal quarter our failure to manage inventory to meet demand our inability to release new products on schedule any failure of our systems related to order 

  

review and processing or any delays in shipments based on trade compliance requirements our revenue for that quarter could fall below our expectations resulting in a decline in the trading price of our common stock 

we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property and our products may infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties 

we rely on a combination of patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure of confidential and proprietary information to protect our intellectual property rights despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology monitoring unauthorized use of our products is difficult and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of our technology particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 

our industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the ordinary course of our business we are involved in disputes and licensing discussions with others regarding their claimed proprietary rights and cannot provide assurance that we will always successfully defend ourselves against such claims we expect that infringement claims may increase as the number of products and competitors in our market increases and overlaps occur also as we have gained greater visibility market exposure and competitive success we face a higher risk of being the subject of intellectual property infringement claims if we are found to infringe the proprietary rights of others or if we otherwise settle such claims we could be compelled to pay damages or royalties and either obtain a license to those intellectual property rights or alter our products so that they no longer infringe upon such proprietary rights any license could be very expensive to obtain or may not be available at all similarly changing our products or processes to avoid infringing upon the rights of others may be costly or impractical in addition we have initiated and may in the future initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to determine the scope and validity of our proprietary rights or those of our competitors any of these claims whether claims that we are infringing the proprietary rights of others or vice versa with or without merit may be timeconsuming result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel or require us to cease using infringing technology develop noninfringing technology or enter into royalty or licensing agreements further our license agreements typically require us to indemnify our customers distributors and resellers for infringement actions related to our technology which could cause us to become involved in infringement claims made against our customers distributors or resellers any of the abovedescribed circumstances relating to intellectual property rights disputes could result in our business and results of operations being harmed 

we incorporate open source software into our products although we monitor our use of open source closely the terms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by us courts and there is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products we could also be subject to similar conditions or restrictions should there be any changes in the licensing terms of the open source software incorporated into our products in either event we could be required to seek licenses from third parties in order to continue offering our products to reengineer our products or to discontinue the sale of our products in the event reengineering cannot be accomplished on a timely or successful basis any of which could adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

many of our products include intellectual property licensed from third parties in the future it may be necessary to renew licenses for third party intellectual property or obtain new licenses for other technology these third party licenses may not be available to us on acceptable terms if at all the inability to obtain certain licenses or litigation regarding the interpretation or enforcement of license rights and related intellectual property issues could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition furthermore we license some third party intellectual property on a nonexclusive basis and this may limit our ability to protect our intellectual property rights in our products 

  

we may not be able to sustain or develop new distribution relationships and a reduction or delay in sales to significant distribution partners could hurt our business 

we sell our products and services through multiple distribution channels in the united states and internationally including leading industry distributors valueadded resellers systems integrators service providers and other indirect channel partners we have a limited number of agreements with companies in these channels and we may not be able to increase our number of distribution relationships or maintain our existing relationships recruiting and retaining qualified channel partners and training them in our technologies requires significant time and resources these channel partners may also market sell and support products and services that are competitive with ours and may devote more resources to the marketing sales and support of such competitive products our indirect sales channel structure could subject us to lawsuits potential liability and reputational harm if for example any of our channel partners misrepresent the functionality of our products or services to customers or violate laws or our corporate policies if we are unable to establish or maintain our indirect sales channels our business and results of operations will be harmed in addition two worldwide distributors of our products accounted for 309 of our total net revenue for fiscal year 2012 two worldwide distributors of our products accounted for 288 of our total net revenue for fiscal year 2011 a substantial reduction or delay in sales of our products to these distribution partners if not replaced by sales to other indirect channel partners and distributors could harm our business operating results and financial condition 

undetected software or hardware errors or security vulnerabilities may harm our business and results of operations 

our products may contain undetected errors or defects when first introduced or as new versions are released we have experienced these errors or defects in the past in connection with new products and product upgrades we expect that these errors or defects will be found from time to time in new or enhanced products after commencement of commercial shipments these problems may cause us to incur significant warranty and repair costs divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts and cause significant customer relations problems we may also be subject to liability claims for damages related to product errors or defects while we carry insurance policies covering this type of liability these policies may not provide sufficient protection should a claim be asserted a material product liability claim may harm our business and results of operations 

our products must successfully operate with products from other vendors as a result when problems occur in a network it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem the occurrence of software or hardware problems whether caused by our products or another vendor’s products may result in the delay or loss of market acceptance of our products the occurrence of any of these problems may harm our business and results of operations 

our products are used to manage critical applications and data for customers and third parties may attempt to exploit security vulnerabilities in our products as we continue to focus on the development and marketing of security solutions we become a bigger target for malicious computer hackers who wish to exploit security vulnerabilities in our products these problems may cause us to incur significant remediation costs divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts and cause significant customer relations problems adverse publicity related to security vulnerabilities or damage to a customer’s operations due to exploitation of security vulnerability in our products may harm our business and results of operations 

any errors defects or vulnerabilities in our products could result in 

 

  

  

   

  

  

 we are dependent on various information technology systems and failures of or interruptions to those systems could harm our business 

many of our business processes depend upon our information technology it systems the systems and processes of third parties and on interfaces with the systems of third parties for example our order entry system provides information to the systems of our contract manufacturers which enables them to build and ship our products if those systems fail or are interrupted or if our ability to connect to or interact with one or more networks is interrupted our processes may function at a diminished level or not at all this would harm our ability to ship products and our financial results may be harmed 

in addition reconfiguring our it systems or other business processes in response to changing business needs may be timeconsuming and costly to the extent this impacted our ability to react timely to specific market or business opportunities our financial results may be harmed 

adverse general economic conditions or reduced information technology spending may adversely impact our business 

a substantial portion of our business depends on the demand for information technology by large enterprise customers and service providers the overall economic health of our current and prospective customers and the continued growth and evolution of the internet international national regional and local economic conditions such as recessionary economic cycles protracted economic slowdown or further deterioration of the economy could adversely impact demand for our products the purchase of our products is often discretionary and may involve a significant commitment of capital and other resources continued weak economic conditions or a reduction in information technology spending even if economic conditions improve would likely result in longer sales cycles and reduced product sales each of which would adversely impact our business results of operations and financial condition 

our operating results are exposed to risks associated with international commerce 

as our international sales increase our operating results become more exposed to international operating risks these risks include risks related to recessionary economic cycles or protracted slowdowns in economies outside the united states foreign currency exchange rates managing foreign sales offices regulatory political or economic conditions in specific countries military conflict or terrorist activities changes in laws and tariffs inadequate protection of intellectual property rights in foreign countries foreign regulatory requirements and natural disasters we must hire and train experienced personnel to staff and manage our foreign operations to the extent that we experience difficulties in recruiting training managing and retaining an international staff and specifically staff related to sales management and sales personnel we may experience difficulties in sales productivity in foreign markets we also enter into strategic distributor and reseller relationships with companies in certain international markets where we do not have a local presence if we are not able to maintain successful strategic distributor relationships internationally or recruit additional companies to enter into strategic distributor relationships our future success in these international markets could be limited business practices in the international markets that we serve may differ from those in the united states and may require us in the future to include terms other than our standard terms in customer contracts although to date we generally have not done so to the extent that we may enter into customer contracts in the future that include nonstandard terms related to payment warranties or performance obligations our operating results may be adversely impacted all of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business we intend to continue expanding into 

  

international markets sales outside of the americas represented 424 and 412 of our net revenues for the fiscal years ended september 30 2012 and 2011 respectively 

changes in governmental regulations could negatively affect our revenues 

our products are subject to various regulations promulgated by the united states and various foreign governments including but not limited to environmental regulations and regulations implementing export license requirements and restrictions on the import or export of some technologies especially encryption technology changes in governmental regulation and our inability or failure to obtain required approvals permits or registrations could harm our international and domestic sales and adversely affect our revenues business and operations 

changes in financial accounting standards may cause adverse unexpected revenue fluctuations and affect our reported results of operations 

a change in accounting policies can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective new pronouncements and varying interpretations of existing pronouncements have occurred with frequency and may occur in the future changes to existing rules or changes to the interpretations of existing rules could lead to changes in our accounting practices and such changes could adversely affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business 

we may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities 

our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely affected by nondeductible stockbased compensation changes in the research and development tax credit laws earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and being higher than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates transfer pricing adjustments not meeting the terms and conditions of tax holidays or incentives changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in actual results versus our estimates or changes in tax laws regulations accounting principles or interpretations thereof in addition like other companies we may be subject to examination of our income tax returns by the us internal revenue service and other tax authorities while we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes from such examinations and the adequacy of our provision for income taxes there can be no assurance that such provision is sufficient and that a determination by a tax authority will not have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

acquisitions present many risks and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that are contemplated at the time of the transaction 

with respect to our past acquisitions as well as any other future acquisitions we may undertake we may find that the acquired businesses products or technologies do not further our business strategy as expected that we paid more than what the assets are later worth or that economic conditions change all of which may generate future impairment charges our acquisitions may be viewed negatively by customers financial markets or investors there may be difficulty integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired business and we may have difficulty retaining the key personnel of the acquired business we may have difficulty in integrating the acquired technologies or products with our existing product lines our ongoing business and management’s attention may be disrupted or diverted by transition or integration issues and the complexity of managing geographically and culturally diverse locations we may have difficulty maintaining uniform standards controls procedures and policies across locations we may experience significant problems or liabilities associated with product quality technology and other matters 

our inability to successfully operate and integrate newlyacquired businesses appropriately effectively and in a timely manner or to retain key personnel of any acquired business could have a material adverse effect on 

  

our ability to take advantage of further growth in demand for integrated traffic management and security solutions and other advances in technology as well as on our revenues gross margins and expenses 

our success depends on our key personnel and our ability to hire retain and motivate qualified sales and marketing operations product development and professional services personnel 

our success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our key management product development sales marketing and finance personnel many of whom may be difficult to replace the complexity of our application delivery networking products and their integration into existing networks and ongoing support as well as the sophistication of our sales and marketing effort requires us to retain highly trained professional services customer support and sales personnel competition for qualified professional services customer support and sales personnel in our industry is intense because of the limited number of people available with the necessary technical skills and understanding of our products our ability to hire and retain these personnel may be adversely affected by volatility or reductions in the price of our common stock since these employees are generally granted restricted stock units the loss of services of any of our key personnel the inability to retain and attract qualified personnel in the future or delays in hiring qualified personnel may harm our business and results of operations 

we face litigation risks 

we are a party to lawsuits in the normal course of our business litigation in general and intellectual property and securities litigation in particular can be expensive lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations moreover the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict responding to lawsuits has been and will likely continue to be expensive and timeconsuming for us an unfavorable resolution of these lawsuits could adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

antitakeover provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us 

our board of directors has the authority to issue up to 10000000 shares of preferred stock and to determine the price rights preferences privileges and restrictions including voting rights of those shares without any further vote or action by the shareholders the rights of the holders of common stock may be subject to and may be adversely affected by the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future the issuance of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a change of control of our company without further action by our shareholders and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of the holders of common stock further certain provisions of our bylaws including a provision limiting the ability of shareholders to raise matters at a meeting of shareholders without giving advance notice may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or management of our company which could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock in addition our articles of incorporation currently provide for a staggered board which may make it more difficult for a third party to gain control of our board of directors similarly state antitakeover laws in the state of washington related to corporate takeovers may prevent or delay a change of control of our company 

our business is subject to the risks of earthquakes fire power outages floods and other catastrophic events and to interruption by manmade problems such as terrorism 

a significant natural disaster such as an earthquake fire a flood or significant power outage could have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition we have an administrative and product development office and a third party contract manufacturer located in the san francisco bay area a region known for seismic activity in addition natural disasters could affect our supply chain manufacturing vendors or logistics providers’ ability to provide materials and perform services such as manufacturing products or assisting with shipments on a timely basis in the event our or our service providers’ information technology systems or manufacturing or logistics abilities are hindered by any of the events discussed above shipments 

  

could be delayed resulting in missed financial targets such as revenue and shipment targets for a particular quarter in addition cyberattacks acts of terrorism or other geopolitical unrest could cause disruptions in our business or the business of our supply chain manufacturers logistics providers partners or endcustomers or the economy as a whole any disruption in the business of our supply chain manufacturers logistics providers partners or endcustomers that impacts sales at the end of a fiscal quarter could have a significant adverse impact on our quarterly results all of the aforementioned risks may be further increased if the disaster recovery plans for us and our suppliers prove to be inadequate to the extent that any of the above should result in delays or cancellations of customer orders or the delay in the manufacture deployment or shipment of our products our business financial condition and operating results would be adversely affected

 critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements 

revenue recognition we sell products through distributors resellers and directly to end users revenue is recognized provided that all of the following criteria have been met 

 

  

  

  

 in certain regions where we do not have the ability to reasonably estimate returns we defer revenue on sales to our distributors until they have received information from the channel partner indicating that the product has been sold to the enduser customer payment terms to domestic customers are generally net 30 days to net 45 

  

days payment terms to international customers range from net 30 days to net 120 days based on normal and customary trade practices in the individual markets we offer extended payment terms to certain customers in which case revenue is recognized when payments are due 

whenever product training services and postcontract customer support pcs elements are sold together a portion of the sales price is allocated to each element based on their respective fair values as determined when the individual elements are sold separately revenue from the sale of products is recognized when the product has been shipped and the customer is obligated to pay for the product when rights of return are present and we cannot estimate returns we recognize revenue when such rights of return lapse revenues for pcs are recognized on a straightline basis over the service contract term pcs includes a limited period of telephone support updates repair or replacement of any failed product or component that fails during the term of the agreement bug fixes and rights to upgrades when and if available consulting services are customarily billed at fixed hourly rates plus outofpocket expenses and revenues are recognized when the consulting has been completed training revenue is recognized when the training has been completed 

in october 2009 the financial accounting standards board fasb amended the accounting standards for revenue recognition to remove from the scope of industryspecific software revenue recognition guidance any tangible products containing software components and nonsoftware components that operate together to deliver the products essential functionality in addition the fasb amended the accounting standards for certain multiple element revenue arrangements to 

 

  

  

 the majority of our products are hardware appliances that contain software essential to the overall functionality of the products accordingly we no longer recognize revenue on sales of these products in accordance with the industryspecific software revenue recognition guidance 

for all transactions entered into prior to the first quarter of fiscal year 2011 and for sales of nonessential and standalone software after october 1 2010 we allocate revenue for arrangements with multiple elements based on the software revenue recognition guidance software revenue recognition guidance requires revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements to be allocated to each element based on the relative fair values of those elements the fair value of an element must be based on vsoe where fair value of certain elements is not available revenue is recognized on the “residual method” based on the fair value of undelivered elements if evidence of the fair value of one or more undelivered elements does not exist all revenue is deferred and recognized at the earlier of the delivery of those elements or the establishment of fair value of the remaining undelivered elements 

for transactions entered into subsequent to the adoption of the amended revenue recognition standards that are multipleelement arrangements the arrangement consideration is allocated to each element based on the relative selling prices of all of the elements in the arrangement using the fair value hierarchy in the amended revenue recognition guidance 

consistent with the methodology used under the previous accounting guidance we establish vsoe for our products training services pcs and consulting services based on the sales price charged for each element when 

  

sold separately the sales price is discounted from the applicable list price based on various factors including the type of customer volume of sales geographic region and program level our list prices are generally not fair value as discounts may be given based on the factors enumerated above we believe that the fair value of our consulting services is represented by the billable consulting rate per hour based on the rates we charge customers when they purchase standalone consulting services the price of consulting services is not based on the type of customer volume of sales geographic region or program level 

we use historical sales transactions to determine whether vsoe can be established for each of the elements in most instances vsoe is the sales price of actual standalone unbundled transactions within the past 12 month period that are priced within a reasonable range which we have determined to be plus or minus 15 of the median sales price of each respective price list 

vsoe of pcs is based on standalone sales since we do not provide stated renewal rates to our customers in accordance with our pcs pricing practice supported by standalone renewal sales renewal contracts are priced as a percentage of the undiscounted product list price the pcs renewal percentages may vary depending on the type and length of pcs purchased we offer standard and premium pcs and the term generally ranges from one to three years we employ a bellshapedcurve approach in evaluating vsoe of fair value of pcs under this approach we consider vsoe of the fair value of pcs to exist when a substantial majority of our standalone pcs sales fall within a narrow range of pricing 

we are typically not able to determine tpe for our products or services tpe is based on competitor prices for similar elements when sold separately generally our gotomarket strategy differs from that of other competitive products or services in our markets and our offerings contain a significant level of differentiation such that the comparable pricing of products with similar functionality cannot be obtained furthermore we are unable to reliably determine the selling prices on a standalone basis of similar products offered by our competitors 

when we are unable to establish the selling price of our nonsoftware elements using vsoe or tpe we use besp in our allocation of arrangement consideration the objective of besp is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a standalone basis we are generally not able to establish vsoe for nonsoftware product sales under software revenue recognition guidance these product sales were accounted for utilizing the residual method with the adoption of the new revenue recognition guidance we have been able to establish besp for nonsoftware product sales through the list price less a discount deemed appropriate to maintain a reasonable gross margin management regularly reviews the gross margin information nonsoftware product besp is determined through our review of historical sales transactions within the past 12 month period additional factors considered in determining an appropriate besp include but are not limited to cost of products pricing practices geographies customer classes and distribution channels 

we have established and regularly validate the vsoe of fair value and besp for elements in our multiple element arrangements we account for taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities on a net basis and excluded from revenues 

reserve for doubtful accounts estimates are used in determining our allowance for doubtful accounts and are based upon an assessment of selected accounts and as a percentage of our remaining accounts receivable by aging category in determining these percentages we evaluate historical writeoffs current trends in the credit quality of our customer base as well as changes in the credit policies we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition and do not require any collateral if there is deterioration of a major customer’s credit worthiness or actual defaults are higher than our historical experience our allowance for doubtful accounts may not be sufficient 

reserve for product returns in some instances product revenue from distributors is subject to agreements allowing rights of return product returns are estimated based on historical experience and are recorded at the 

  

time revenues are recognized accordingly we reduce recognized revenue for estimated future returns at the time revenue is recorded when rights of return are present and we cannot estimate returns revenue is recognized when such rights lapse the estimates for returns are adjusted periodically based upon changes in historical rates of returns and other related factors it is possible that these estimates will change in the future or that the actual amounts could vary from our estimates 

accounting for income taxes we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure including assessing the risks associated with tax audits together with assessing temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities due to the evolving nature and complexity of tax rules combined with the large number of jurisdictions in which we operate it is possible that our estimates of our tax liability could change in the future which may result in additional tax liabilities and adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

stockbased compensation we account for stockbased compensation using the straightline attribution method for recognizing compensation expense over the requisite service period of the related award we recognized 953 million and 897 million of stockbased compensation expense for the years ended september 30 2012 and 2011 respectively as of september 30 2012 there was 1349 million of total unrecognized stockbased compensation cost the majority of which will be recognized over the next two years going forward stockbased compensation expenses may increase as we issue additional equitybased awards to continue to attract and retain key employees 

we issue incentive awards to our employees through stockbased compensation consisting of restricted stock units rsus the value of rsus is determined using the fair value method which in this case is based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock on the date of grant 

we recognize compensation expense for only the portion of rsus that are expected to vest therefore we apply estimated forfeiture rates that are derived from historical employee termination behavior based on historical differences with forfeitures of stockbased awards granted to our executive officers and board of directors versus grants awarded to all other employees we developed separate forfeiture expectations for these two groups in fiscal year 2012 the estimated forfeiture rate for grants awarded to our executive officers and board of directors was approximately 6 and the estimated forfeiture rate for grants awarded to all other employees was approximately 9 if the actual number of forfeitures differs from those estimated by management additional adjustments to stockbased compensation expense may be required in future periods 

we recognize compensation costs for awards with performance conditions when we conclude it is probable that the performance condition will be achieved we reassess the probability of vesting at each balance sheet date and adjust compensation costs based on our probability assessment 

common stock repurchase on october 25 2011 we announced that our board of directors authorized an additional 200 million for our common stock share repurchase program this new authorization is incremental to the existing 400 million program initially approved in october 2010 and expanded in august 2011 acquisitions for the share repurchase programs will be made from time to time in private transactions or open market purchases as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements the programs can be terminated at any time as of november 15 2012 we had repurchased and retired 9327774 shares at an average price of 6763 per share and we had 1687 million remaining to purchase shares as part of our repurchase programs 

goodwill and intangible assets we have goodwill and intangible assets on our balance sheet related to acquisitions intangible assets are carried and reported at acquisition cost net of accumulated amortization subsequent to acquisition intangible assets are amortized over the estimated useful lives which generally range from three to five years intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances 

  

indicate impairment might exist projected undiscounted net cash flows expected to be derived from the use of those assets are compared to the respective net carrying amounts to determine whether any impairment exists impairment if any is based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets 

the determination of the net carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets and the extent to which if any there is impairment are dependent on material estimates and judgments on our part including the useful life over which the intangible assets are to be amortized and the estimates of the value of future net cash flows which are based upon further estimates of future revenues expenses and operating margins we review our goodwill annually for impairment in the second fiscal quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable we first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary if we believe as a result of our qualitative assessment that it is morelikelythannot ie greater than 50 chance that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount a quantitative impairment test will be required otherwise no further testing will be required examples of events and circumstances that might indicate that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount include macroeconomic conditions such as deterioration in the entity’s operating environment or industry or market considerations entityspecific events such as increasing costs declining financial performance or loss of key personnel or other events such as an expectation that a reporting unit will be sold or a sustained decrease in the stock price on either an absolute basis or relative to peers 

if it is determined as a result of the qualitative assessment that it is morelikelythannot that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount the provisions of authoritative guidance require that we perform a twostep impairment test on goodwill the first step of the test identifies whether potential impairment may have occurred while the second step of the test measures the amount of the impairment if any impairment is recognized when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its fair value for our annual goodwill impairment analysis we operate under one reporting unit and the fair value of the reporting unit is based on the company’s enterprise value in march 2012 we completed a qualitative assessment of potential impairment indicators and concluded that it was morelikelythannot that the fair value of our reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount additionally we considered potential impairment indicators at september 30 2012 and noted no indicators of impairment 

investments our investments are diversified among highcredit quality debt securities in accordance with our investment policy we classify our investments as availableforsale which are reported at fair market value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss in stockholders’ equity realized gains and losses and declines in value of these investments judged to be other than temporary are included in other income expense to date we have not deemed it necessary to record any charges related to otherthantemporary declines in the estimated fair values of our marketable debt securities however the fair value of our investments is subject to volatility declines in the fair value of our investments judged to be other than temporary could adversely affect our future operating results 

our investments also include auction rate securities ars that are classified as availableforsale ars are reported at fair market value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss in stockholders’ equity we believe these investments may remain illiquid for longer than twelve months and as a result we have classified these investments as longterm as of september 30 2012 we used the income approach to determine the fair value of our ars using a discounted cash flow analysis the assumptions we used in preparing the discounted cash flow model include estimates for interest rates estimates for discount rates using yields of comparable traded instruments adjusted for illiquidity and other risk factors amount of cash flows and expected holding periods for the ars 

  

results of operations 

the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

 

 net revenues total net revenues increased 196 in fiscal year 2012 from fiscal year 2011 compared to an increase of 306 in fiscal year 2011 from the prior year overall revenue growth for the year ended september 30 2012 was primarily due to increased service and product revenues as a result of our increased installed base of products and increased demand for our core adn products including application security products international revenues represented 471 455 and 454 of net revenues in fiscal years 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively we expect international sales will continue to represent a significant portion of net revenues although we cannot provide assurance that international revenues as a percentage of net revenues will remain at current levels 

net product revenues increased 134 in fiscal year 2012 from fiscal year 2011 compared to an increase of 287 in fiscal year 2011 from the prior year the increase of 966 million in net product sales for fiscal year 2012 was primarily due to growth in the volume of product sales of our adn products the increase of 1608 million in net product sales for fiscal year 2011 was also primarily due to growth in the volume of product sales of our adn products sales of our adn products represented 986 974 and 972 of total product revenues in fiscal years 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively 

net service revenues increased 300 in fiscal year 2012 from fiscal year 2011 compared to an increase of 340 in fiscal year 2011 from the prior year the increases in service revenue were the result of increased purchases or renewals of maintenance contracts driven by additions to our installed base of products 

avnet technology solutions one of our worldwide distributors accounted for 171 181 and 145 of our total net revenues in fiscal years 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively ingram micro inc another worldwide distributor accounted for 138 and 107 of our total net revenues in fiscal year 2012 and 2011 respectively tech data another worldwide distributor accounted for 102 of our total net revenues in fiscal year 2010 avnet technology solutions and ingram micro inc accounted for 134 and 120 of our accounts receivable as of september 30 2012 respectively avnet technology solutions and ingram micro inc accounted for 150 and 145 of our accounts receivable as of september 30 2011 respectively no other distributors accounted for more than 10 of total net revenue or receivables 

  

 cost of net product revenues cost of net product revenues consist of finished products purchased from our contract manufacturers manufacturing overhead freight warranty provisions for excess and obsolete inventory and amortization expenses in connection with developed technology from acquisitions cost of net product revenues increased to 1371 million in fiscal year 2012 up 60 from the prior year primarily due to a higher volume of units shipped the increase in cost of net product revenues for fiscal year 2012 was partially offset by a reduction in warranty expense of 35 million from the prior year cost of net product revenues increased to 1293 million in fiscal year 2011 from 1138 million in fiscal year 2010 the year over year increase was primarily due to a higher volume of units shipped along with an increase in warranty expense 

cost of net service revenues cost of net service revenues consist of the salaries and related benefits of our professional services staff travel facilities and depreciation expenses cost of net service revenues as a percentage of net service revenues decreased to 177 in fiscal year 2012 compared to 183 in fiscal year 2011 primarily due to the scalability of our existing customer support infrastructure and increased revenue from maintenance contracts cost of net service revenues as a percentage of net service revenues in fiscal year 2011 remained relatively consistent with the prior year at 183 professional services headcount at the end of fiscal year 2012 increased to 654 from 528 at the end of fiscal year 2011 and 421 at the end of fiscal year 2010 in addition cost of net service revenues included stockbased compensation expense of 109 million 78 million and 60 million for fiscal years 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively

general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist of the salaries benefits and related costs of our executive finance information technology human resource and legal personnel thirdparty professional service fees bad debt charges facilities and depreciation expenses general and administrative expense increased 99 in fiscal year 2012 compared to the prior year the increase in general and administrative expense for fiscal year 2012 was primarily due to an increase in personnel costs of 55 million compared to the prior year in addition fees paid to outside consultants for legal accounting and information technology services increased 23 million for fiscal year 2012 compared to the prior year in fiscal year 2011 general and administrative expense increased 219 compared to the prior year the increase in general and administrative expense for fiscal year 2011 was primarily due to an increase in personnel costs of 53 million compared to the prior year in addition fees paid to outside consultants for legal accounting and information technology services increased 42 million for fiscal year 2011 compared to the prior year general and administrative headcount at the end of fiscal 2012 increased to 323 from 270 at the end of fiscal 2011 and 226 at the end of fiscal 2010 general and administrative expense included stockbased compensation expense of 196 million 224 million and 170 million for fiscal years 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively 

  

 other income net other income net consists primarily of interest income and foreign currency transaction gains and losses other income net decreased 414 in fiscal year 2012 as compared to fiscal year 2011 and increased 323 in fiscal year 2011 as compared to fiscal year 2010 interest income was 69 million 81 million and 81 million for fiscal years 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively the decrease in other income net for fiscal year 2012 as compared to fiscal year 2011 was primarily due to a reduction in interest income of 12 million and foreign currency transaction losses of 24 million the increase in other income net for fiscal year 2011 as compared to fiscal year 2010 was primarily due to a onetime charge of 15 million related to a legal settlement in fiscal year 2010 that was not incurred in fiscal year 2011 in addition foreign currency transaction gains increased by 10 million in fiscal year 2011 compared to the prior year 

provision for income taxes we recorded a 363 provision for income taxes for fiscal year 2012 compared to 331 in fiscal year 2011 and 364 in fiscal year 2010 the increase in the effective tax rate from fiscal year 2011 to fiscal year 2012 was primarily due to the expiration of the united states federal credit for increasing research activities at december 31 2011 and an increase in nondeductible stockbased compensation attributable to foreign based employees 

at september 30 2012 there have been no material valuation allowances established on any of our deferred tax assets in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate because we believe that these assets are more likely than not to be realized in making these determinations we have considered projected future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the appropriateness of a valuation allowance our net deferred tax assets as of fiscal year end 2012 2011 and 2010 were 458 million 432 million and 466 million respectively our worldwide effective tax rate may fluctuate based on a number of factors including variations in projected taxable income in our various geographic locations in which we operate changes in the valuation of our net deferred tax assets the tax effects of stockbased compensation resolution of potential exposures tax positions taken on tax returns filed in the various geographic locations in which we operate and the introduction of new accounting standards or changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof in the various geographic locations in which we operate we have recorded liabilities to address potential tax exposures related to business and income tax positions we have taken that could be challenged by taxing authorities the ultimate resolution of these potential exposures may be greater or less than the liabilities recorded which could result in an adjustment to our future tax expense 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

we have funded our operations with our cash balances cash generated from operations and proceeds from public offerings of our securities 

 

 cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and longterm investments totaled 11950 million as of september 30 2012 compared to 10128 million as of september 30 2011 representing an increase of 1822 million the increase was primarily due to cash provided by operating activities of 4954 million for fiscal year 2012 compared to 4169 million for fiscal year 2011 which was partially offset by 1848 million of additional cash required for the repurchase of outstanding common stock under our share repurchase program in fiscal 2012 and 1283 million for the acquisition of traffix systems in fiscal year 2011 the increase was primarily due to cash provided by operating activities of 4169 million compared to 3136 million for fiscal year 2010 which was partially offset by 2715 million of additional cash required for the repurchase of outstanding common stock under our share repurchase program in fiscal 2011 

cash provided by operating activities during fiscal year 2012 was 4954 million compared to 4169 million in fiscal year 2011 and 3136 million in fiscal year 2010 cash provided by operating activities resulted primarily from cash generated from net income after adjusting for noncash charges such as stockbased compensation depreciation and amortization charges and changes in operating assets and liabilities 

cash used in investing activities during fiscal year 2012 was 3523 million compared to 1397 million in fiscal year 2011 and 2382 million in fiscal year 2010 cash used in investing activities for fiscal year 2012 was primarily the result of the purchase of investments and capital expenditures related to maintaining our operations worldwide partially offset by the sale and maturity of investments and 1283 million for the acquisition of traffix systems cash used in investing activities for fiscal year 2011 was primarily the result of the purchase of investments and capital expenditures related to maintaining our operations worldwide partially offset by the sale and maturity of investments cash used in investing activities for fiscal year 2010 was primarily the result of the purchase of investments and capital expenditures related to maintaining our operations worldwide partially offset by the sale and maturity of investments 

cash used in financing activities was 1492 million for fiscal year 2012 compared to 2267 million for fiscal year 2011 and 168 million for fiscal year 2010 cash used in financing activities for fiscal year 2012 included 1848 million to repurchase common stock under our share repurchase program which was partially offset by cash received from the exercise of employee stock options and stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan of 252 million and excess tax benefits related to sharebased compensation of 104 million cash used in financing activities for fiscal year 2011 included 2715 million to repurchase common stock under our share repurchase program which was partially offset by cash received from the exercise of employee stock options and stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan of 212 million and excess tax benefits related to sharebased compensation of 236 million cash used in financing activities for fiscal 2010 included 750 million to repurchase common stock under our share repurchase program which was partially offset by cash received from the exercise of employee stock options and stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan of 317 million and excess tax benefits related to sharebased compensation of 265 million 

based on our current operating and capital expenditure forecasts we believe that our existing cash and investment balances excluding ars together with cash generated from operations should be sufficient to meet our operating requirements for the next twelve months our future capital requirements will depend on many 

  

factors including our rate of revenue growth the expansion of our sales and marketing activities the timing and extent of expansion into new territories the timing of introductions of new products and enhancements of existing products and the continuing market acceptance of our products 

obligations and commitments 

the following table summarizes our contractual payment obligations and commitments as of september 30 2012 

 

 we lease our facilities under operating leases that expire at various dates through 2023 

we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 48 “accounting for income taxes” on october 1 2007 as of september 30 2012 we had approximately 58 million of tax liabilities including interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions see note 6 to our consolidated financial statements because of the high degree of uncertainty regarding the settlement of these liabilities we are unable to estimate the years in which future cash outflows may occur 

purchase obligations are comprised of purchase commitments with our contract manufacturers the agreement with our primary contract manufacturer allows it to procure component inventory on our behalf based on our production forecast we are obligated to purchase component inventory that the contract manufacturer procures in accordance with the forecast unless cancellation is given within applicable lead times 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in may 2011 the fasb issued asu 201104 amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrs  asu 201104 which amends current fair value measurement and disclosure guidance to converge with international financial reporting standards ifrs and provides increased transparency around valuation inputs and investment categorization we adopted asu 201104 in the second quarter of fiscal 2012 the adoption of asu 201104 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in june 2011 the fasb issued asu 201105 comprehensive income presentation of comprehensive income asu 201105 which eliminates the option of presenting other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders’ equity and instead requires the entity to present other comprehensive income as either a single statement of comprehensive income combined with net income or as two separate but continuous statements the amendments in this standard are to be applied retrospectively and are effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december 15 2011 we will adopt asu 201105 in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 and do not expect the adoption of this standard to have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 

in december 2011 the fasb issued asu 201112 comprehensive income deferral of the effective date for amendments to the presentation of reclassifications of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income in accounting standards update no 201105 asu 201112 which defers the changes in asu 201105 that relate to the presentation of reclassification adjustments to other comprehensive income no other requirements in asu 201105 are affected by this deferral similar to asu 201105 we will adopt asu 201112 in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 and do not expect the adoption of this standard to have an impact on our consolidated financial statements

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk tableend interest rate risk our cash equivalents consist of highquality securities as specified in our investment policy guidelines the policy limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue or issuer to a maximum of 5 of the total portfolio with the exception of us treasury and agency securities commercial paper and money market funds which are exempt from size limitation the policy requires investments in securities that mature in three years or less with the average maturity being no greater than one and a half years these securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if interest rates increase a decrease of one percent in the average interest rate would have resulted in a decrease of approximately 73 million in our interest income for the fiscal year 2012 

 

 at september 30 2012 the fair value of our aaaa or equivalent rated municipal ars was approximately 48 million ars are collateralized longterm debt instruments that provide liquidity through a dutch auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at predetermined intervals typically every 7 28 or 35 days based on our expected operating cash flows and our other sources of cash we do not believe that any reduction in liquidity of our municipal ars will have a material impact on our overall ability to meet our liquidity needs we have no intent to sell won’t be required to sell and believe we will hold these securities until recovery we believe certain of these availableforsale investments may remain illiquid for longer than twelve months and as a result we have classified 50 million par value of securities as longterm as of september 30 2012 

foreign currency risk the majority of our sales and expenses are denominated in us dollars and as a result we have not experienced significant foreign currency transaction gains and losses to date while we have conducted some transactions in foreign currencies during the fiscal year ended september 30 2012 and expect to continue to do so we do not anticipate that foreign currency transaction gains or losses will be significant at our current level of operations however as we continue to expand our operations internationally transaction gains or losses may become significant in the future we have not engaged in foreign currency hedging to date however we may do so in the future

general 

f5 networks is a leading provider of application delivery networking adn technology that optimizes the delivery of networkbased applications and the security performance and availability of servers data storage devices and other network resources as strategic points of control within a network our products collectively function as a dynamic control plane that simplifies the management of data center operations and the delivery of services across diverse data center resources 

founded in 1996 f5 networks pioneered loadbalancing technology that distributes internet traffic evenly across multiple servers making them appear like a single device today our bigip application delivery controllers adcs are generally positioned in front of web and application servers balancing traffic and performing computeintensive functions such as encrypting and unencrypting transmissions screening traffic for security threats maintaining open connections with servers speeding the flow of traffic managing access to applications and data and a variety of other functions that improve the security performance and availability of applications 

by offloading functions from servers bigip adcs make servers more efficient reduce the number of servers needed to run specific applications lower the cost of power and cooling and drive down operating costs by simplifying the management of servers and applications in virtual environments this allows customers to increase the density of virtual servers running on physical servers and reduces the added complexity of managing a dynamic environment 

the core of our adn technology is our fullproxy traffic management operating system tmos that enables our products to inspect and modify traffic flows to and from servers at network speed and supports a broad and growing array of functions that enhance the security performance and availability of applications irules a scripting language based on tool command language tcl is a unique feature of tmos that enables customers and third parties to write customized rules to inspect and modify traffic 

  

tmos also supports a common software interface called icontrol which enables our products to communicate with one another and with thirdparty products including custom and commercial enterprise applications tmos is designed to support the addition of new functionality as software modules and to exploit the performanceenhancing features of our purposebuilt hardware platforms correspondingly our hardware architecture integrates industry standard components with components we design ourselves to optimize tmos and deliver performance that is demonstrably superior to competing products 

just as our adcs make many servers look like one arx storage virtualization products sit in front of network attached storage nas making multiple storage devices from different vendors look like a single device to the individual clients servers and applications that use them in addition arx products simplify the migration of data between storage devices the addition of new storage devices and the distribution of files across tiers of storage including cloud storage services that reflect their relative immediacy or importance

industry background 

growth and evolution of ipbased infrastructures 

internet protocol ip is a communications language used to transmit data over the internet for more than two decades large business and government organizations have been gradually replacing older data center architectures with ipbased infrastructures deploying new ipbased applications and replacing or upgrading legacy applications with new ipenabled versions at the same time organizations have become more geographically dispersed and increasingly mobile workforces depend on access to corporate applications and data from remote locations and a variety of client devices including smartphones tablets and laptops 

within the past three years the information technology landscape has changed dramatically as organizations have responded to the slowdown in the global economy by using technologies such as virtualization and the growing availability and sophistication of cloud computing to reduce capital and operating costs and enhance the flexibility and efficiency of their information infrastructures these efforts are reflected in the ongoing trend toward data center consolidation that includes a reduction in both the number and size of data centers in addition a growing number of organizations are turning to social networking and other online vehicles to help target customers and compete more effectively in an environment of reduced consumer spending the rapid growth of social networks such as facebook and twitter coupled with the explosion of mobile devices and applications has challenged the abilities of content and service providers to keep up with growing demand 

along with the growth of internet traffic the proliferation of unstructured data such as voice video images email spreadsheets and formatted text files continues to present an enormous and increasing challenge to it organizations historically it organizations have responded to this challenge primarily by adding more storage file virtualization is a relatively new technology that enables organizations to store and manage files across a heterogeneous array of storage devices and lower their overall cost of storage 

emergence of the dynamic data center 

from a broad perspective the goal of it organizations is to optimize the secure delivery of applications and data to users wherever they are and whenever they need them in a recent survey by a leading industry research firm global cios ranked developing or managing a flexible it infrastructure as their number one priority to achieve these goals it organizations are embracing virtualization technologies that enable them to group or partition data center resources to meet user demand and reconfigure these virtual resources easily and quickly as demand changes many are also taking advantage of the growing availability of external cloud resources as a flexible secure and reliable alternative to owning and managing everything themselves as a result it infrastructure 

  

has become increasingly dynamic complex and reliant on ipbased networks for the delivery of applications and data at the same time these changes have created new challenges to the security of ip networks and the applications and data accessible over the internet within the past year sophisticated denial of service attacks have exposed a major vulnerability in the security perimeter of corporate networks by overwhelming firewalls and effectively shutting down the networks in addition many networklevel security threats are directly related to the improper use of the same protocols applications depend on to transmit data over the wire intrusion detection and prevention devices which rely on signature databases of known threats afford some protection against these types of attack however they offer no protection against many of the most common threats including information leakage content spoofing crosssite request forgery or “day zero” attacks designed to exploit a variety of application vulnerabilities 

in addition to preventing the threat of attacks designed to disrupt destroy or block access to network applications organizations are faced with the equally daunting challenge of controlling access to applications and data the proliferation of mobile devices has given users with smart phones tablets and laptops the ability to access corporate data centers from virtually anywhere this in turn has increased the difficulty of ensuring that mobile users are able to access applications and data for which they are authorized and that applications and data are protected from access by unauthorized users 

need to optimize the secure delivery of applications and data 

with the ongoing evolution and increasing complexity of it infrastructures there is a growing need to optimize the secure delivery of applications and data over ip networks ipbased traffic passing between client devices and servers is divided into discrete packets that travel by multiple routes to their destination where they are reassembled the disassembly routing and reassembly of transmissions are relatively straightforward and require little intelligence by contrast managing inspecting modifying redirecting and securing application traffic going to and from servers requires intelligent systems capable of performing a broad array of functions broadly speaking all of those functions are aspects of application delivery networking 

adcs dynamically manage the flow of traffic between users and servers physical or virtual making them look like a single resource to the user in addition they free up resources by offloading common network functions such as encryption ipv4ipv6 translation compression authentication rateshaping and a variety of specialized functions including network and application security services policy management and wan optimization that would otherwise run on the servers or be coded into the applications since most large enterprises have hundreds — if not thousands — of servers and applications it is not practical to replicate these functions on each server or within each virtual instance of an application doing so would take up valuable network resources and reduce the number of applications that could run on each server maintenance costs would be prohibitive and the net result would be a negative impact on the overall performance of servers and applications offloading specific functions onto point solutions can eliminate those problems but introduces a new set of challenges using point solutions from multiple vendors can create interoperability issues and problems that do occur can be difficult to troubleshoot from a security standpoint it is also much more difficult to audit traffic passing through multiple devices providing a comprehensive set of integrated application delivery features and functions on a single highperformance platform simplifies management of the device and the servers it sits in front of and reduces overall capital and operating costs file virtualization delivers similar benefits by reducing the cost and complexity of file storage 

along with other types of ip traffic the volume of filebased information created and accessed by internet users and network applications is growing rapidly file virtualization allows it organizations to map individual users and applications to a single device that can distribute files across a heterogeneous array of storage devices keep track of their location and retrieve them as needed file virtualization devices maximize storage utilization and simplify the migration of data from one vendor’s storage devices to another’s they can also be programmed to allocate files across tiers of storage systems matching the cost capacity and performance of the storage devices to the type of information being stored frequency of usage and relative importance substantially reducing both the capital and operating costs associated with file storage 

f5’s strategy 

our objective is to lead the industry in delivering network architectures that integrate ip networks with applications and data enabling the delivery of dynamic services in the data center those services include security optimization and orchestration of data center operations and resources as well as coordination of services spanning multiple data centers our products are designed to be strategic points of control in the it infrastructure that allow business policies to be implemented where information is exchanged this enables organizations to respond quickly to changing business needs improve costly and time consuming business processes and develop new sources of revenue through highly differentiated offerings key components of our strategy include 

  

offering a complete integrated application delivery product suite 

since the introduction of our tmos architecture for application delivery networking we have developed tmosbased versions of our own legacy products such as gtm and link controller and acquired technology including asm webaccelerator wan optimization module wom edge gateway and application policy manager apm all of these products are currently available as integrated software modules on our bigip family of adcs we believe this approach sharply differentiates our products from our competitors’ offerings and provides customers with an expanding array of integrated application delivery networking solutions that can be customized to meet their specific needs 

investing in technology to meet evolving customer needs 

we continue to invest in research and development to provide our customers with comprehensive integrated solutions in application delivery networking our product development efforts leverage the unique attributes of our softwarebased platforms to deliver new features and functions that address the complex changing needs of our customers although the bulk of our investment in application delivery and file virtualization technologies is software development concurrent development of tightly integrated highperformance hardware is a key part of our investment strategy we also look for opportunities to acquire technologies that will enable us to broaden the scope of our offerings and expand into adjacent markets 

continuing to build and expand relationships with strategic technology partners 

to compete successfully against cisco systems inc and other large competitors who have an established presence in our target accounts we have developed strategic technology partnerships with enterprise software vendors such as microsoft oracle vmware and sap who often have an established or growing presence in those accounts by taking advantage of our open application programming interface called icontrol these vendors can equip their applications to control our products in the network enhancing overall application performance in return they provide us significant leverage in the selling process by recommending our products to their customers we have also worked closely with several of these vendors to develop configurations of our products called iapps that are specifically designed to simplify deployment and optimize the performance of their applications these solutions are available as templates which allow quick and easy configuration of our products for specific applications we plan to continue building on our existing relationships and to extend our competitive edge by developing new relationships with other strategic partners 

leveraging devcentral our online community of network architects and developers 

customization of our products using irules enhances their “stickiness” by allowing customers to solve problems in both their applications and their networks that would be difficult if not impossible to solve by other means to promote the use of irules we host an online community devcentral where network architects and developers can discuss and share the ways in which they use irules to solve problems and enhance the security performance and availability of applications a corollary benefit is that many of the irules solutions posted by devcentral participants have become standard features in new releases of tmos devcentral also provides a valuable window into our customers’ constantly evolving needs 

f5 solutions 

we design integrated software products that run on purposebuilt hardware and are also available as virtual software only editions our products function as strategic points of control in ip networks inspecting modifying and directing traffic to optimize the security availability and delivery of applications and data to any user anywhere we believe our products offer the most intelligent architecture and advanced functionality in the marketplace along with performance and flexibility that enable organizations to simplify management of their data center operations and integrate disparate resources to reduce operating costs enhance productivity and improve service to employees customers and partners 

application delivery networking 

since 2004 we have expanded the breadth of features and functionality we offer well beyond the scope of application delivery networking as it has been traditionally defined today we offer solutions that include application security secure remote access wan optimization and access policy management opening up large opportunities in several adjacent markets many of the features and functions that differentiate our products are built into tmos our fullproxy operating system others are available as software modules that run on tmos 

  

software 

the core of our technology is tmos our traffic management operating system introduced in september 2004 the fullproxy characteristics of the tmos architecture enable our products to intercept inspect and act on the contents of traffic from virtually every type of ipenabled application in addition the modularity of the tmos architecture allows us to deliver tightly integrated solutions that secure optimize and ensure the availability of applications and the networks they run on 

traffic management operating system tmos 

since tmos was launched we have introduced two major upgrades adding hundreds of new features designed to interpret and act on specific content in the traffic passing between users and applications tmos version 110 announced in july 2011 includes enhancements to irules a builtin programming language that allows customers to create or modify policies that provide direct granular control over how our products act on traffic at any moment within the application transaction or flow in addition version 110 includes several new features and functions that are unique to our products 

 

  

  

  

  

 tmos version 110 also includes a number of new security features that enhance the ability of our products to protect networks and applications against denial of service attacks and other types of security threats other enhancements include centralized management of multiple devices and improved visibility that allows customers to monitor and record the performance of applications and users

sales and marketing 

sales 

we sell our products and services to large enterprise customers and service providers through a variety of channels including distributors valueadded resellers vars and systems integrators a substantial amount of our revenue for fiscal year 2011 was derived from these channel sales our sales teams work closely with our channel partners and also sell our products and services directly to major accounts 

f5 sales teams our inside sales team generates and qualifies leads for regional sales managers and helps manage accounts by serving as a liaison between the field and internal corporate resources our field sales personnel are located in major cities in four sales regions the americas primarily the united states europe the middle east and africa emea japan and the asia pacific region apac field sales personnel work closely with our channel partners to assist them as necessary in the sale of our products and services to their customers we also sell our products and services directly to customers primarily large enterprises whose accounts are managed by our major account services team field systems engineers support our regional sales managers and channel partners by participating in joint sales calls and providing presale technical resources as needed 

distributors and vars as a key component of our sales strategy we have established relationships with a number of large national and international distributors local and specialized distributors and vars we derive a majority of our product sales from these distributors and vars 

our agreements with these channel partners are not exclusive and do not prevent them from selling competitive products these agreements typically have terms of one year with no obligation to renew and typically do not provide for exclusive sales territories or minimum purchase requirements 

for fiscal year 2011 sales to two of our worldwide distributors avnet technology solutions and ingram micro represented 181 and 107 of our total revenues respectively our agreements with these distributors are standard nonexclusive distribution agreements that renew automatically on an annual basis and can be terminated by either party with 30 days prior written notice the agreements grant avnet technology solutions and ingram micro the right to distribute our products to resellers in north america and certain other territories internationally with no minimum purchase requirements 

systems integrators we also market our products through strategic relationships with systems integrators including dell services hp enterprise services and ibm global services who include our products as core components of application or networkbased solutions they deploy for their customers in most cases systems integrators do not directly purchase our products for resale to their customers instead they typically recommend our products as part of broader solutions such as enterprise resource planning erp or customer relationship management crm solutions that incorporate our products for high availability and enhanced performance 

marketing 

our marketing strategy is driven by the belief that our continued success depends on our ability to understand and anticipate the dynamic needs of our addressable markets and to develop valuable solutions that meet those needs in line with this belief our marketing organization works directly with customers partners and our product development teams to identify and create innovative solutions to further enhance our leadership position in addition our business development team which is a component of our marketing organization closely monitors technology companies in adjacent and complementary markets for opportunities to acquire or partner with those whose solutions are complementary to ours and could enable us to expand our addressable market 

  

another key component of our marketing strategy is to develop and expand our icontrol partnerships working closely with our partners we have developed customizable solutions templates called iapps that help ensure the successful deployment and delivery of their applications over the network these solution templates have been integrated into tmos version 110 and allow customers to configure our products quickly and easily to optimize the performance of specific applications from major software vendors such as microsoft oracle sap and vmware 

to support the growing number of developers using our products including network and application architects we continue to promote and expand devcentral our online community website that provides technical resources to customers prospects and partners wanting to extend and optimize f5 solutions using irules a key aspect of devcentral is an online forum where developers as well as application and network architects discuss and share solutions they have written with irules at the end of fiscal year 2011 devcentral had more than 87500 registered members 

we also engage in a number of marketing programs and initiatives aimed at promoting our brand and creating market awareness of our technology and products these include actively participating in industry trade shows and joint marketing events with channel and technology partners and briefing industry analysts and members of the trade press on our latest products business relationships and technology partnerships in addition we market our products to chief information officers and other information technology professionals through targeted advertising direct mail and highprofile web events 

backlog 

at the end of fiscal years 2011 and 2010 we had product backlog of approximately 409 million and 503 million respectively backlog represents orders confirmed with a purchase order for products to be shipped generally within 90 days to customers with approved credit status orders are subject to cancellation rescheduling by customers or product specification changes by customers although we believe that the backlog orders are firm purchase orders may be cancelled by the customer prior to shipment without significant penalty for this reason we believe that our product backlog at any given date is not a reliable indicator of future revenues 

customer service and technical support 

we believe that our ability to provide consistent highquality customer service and technical support is a key factor in attracting and retaining large enterprise customers accordingly we offer a broad range of support services that include installation phone support hardware repair and replacement software updates online tools consulting and training services 

we provide these services directly to end users and also utilize a multitiered support model leveraging the capabilities of our channel partners when applicable our technical support staff is strategically located in regional service centers to support our global customer base

manufacturing 

we outsource the manufacturing of our preconfigured hardware platforms to third party contract manufacturers for assembly according to our specifications 

flextronics manufactures our adc product line and sanminasci manufactures our arx product line the subcontracting activity at flextronics and sanminasci encompasses prototype builds full production and direct fulfillment our contract manufacturers perform the following activities on our behalf material procurement pcb assembly and test final assembly system test quality control direct shipment and warranty repairs we provide a rolling forecast that allows our contract manufacturers to stock component parts and other materials plan capacity and build finished goods inventory in anticipation of end user demand each of the contract manufacturers procures components in volumes consistent with our forecast necessary to assemble the products and tests the products according to our specifications products are then shipped to our distributors valueadded resellers or end users generally we do not own the components title to the products transfers from the contract manufacturers to us and then to our customers upon delivery at a designated shipment location if the components are unused or the products are not sold within specified periods of time we may incur carrying charges or obsolete material charges for components that our contract manufacturers purchased to build products to meet our forecast or customer orders 

hardware platforms for our products consist primarily of commodity parts and certain custom components designed and approved by our hardware engineering group most of our components are purchased from sources which we believe are readily available from other suppliers however several components used in the assembly of our products are purchased from a single or limited source 

during fiscal year 2010 we transitioned certain subassembly and testing processes of our bigip products from flextronics’s facilities in milpitas california to the flextronics facility in zhuhai china all subassemblies are configured and final tested at flextronics’s milpitas california for distribution to our end users 

competition 

the expanding capabilities of our product offerings have enabled us to address a growing array of market opportunities many of which are outside the bounds of the application delivery networking market as defined and measured by industry analysts such as gartner group dell’oro and others in addition to server loadbalancing and other functions normally associated with application delivery our suite of integrated product modules has expanded our addressable market into security wan optimization and policy management where we compete with a growing number of companies not included among traditional adc vendors the ability to create custom network services using irules has also enabled us our customers and our partners to design solutions to problems for which there is no offtheshelf solution as a result we believe the traditional definitions of our market do not encompass all of the features functions and capabilities of our products or accurately represent the addressable market for those products 

within the more narrowly defined traditional adc market several companies sell server loadbalancing products these include brocade communications systems inc cisco systems inc citrix systems inc radware ltd and a number of smaller competitors a10 networks array networks inc barracuda networks inc and riverbed technology which recently acquired zeus technology ltd 

while file virtualization remains an earlystage market we believe our arx products are unique in terms of technology and functionality and are well positioned within this emerging market 

the principal competitive factors in the markets in which we compete include product features and performance customer support brand recognition the scope of distribution and sales channels and pricing certain of our competitors have and may in the future adopt aggressive pricing policies to gain market share however because of the superior performance broad functionality and unique capabilities of our products which have resulted in high levels of customer satisfaction and growing brand awareness we believe that we can and will compete effectively against such pricing policies 

  

intellectual property 

we rely on a combination of patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights we have obtained 95 patents in the united states 10 foreign patents and have applications pending for various aspects of our technology our future success depends in part on our ability to protect our proprietary rights to the technologies used in our principal products despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use trade secrets or other information that we regard as proprietary in addition the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights as fully as do the laws of the united states any issued patent may not preserve our proprietary position and competitors or others may develop technologies similar to or superior to our technology our failure to enforce and protect our intellectual property rights could harm our business operating results and financial condition 

in addition to our own proprietary software we incorporate software licensed from several thirdparty sources into our products these licenses generally renew automatically on an annual basis we believe that alternative technologies for these licenses are available both domestically and internationally 

employees 

as of september 30 2011 we had 2488 fulltime employees including 610 in product development 1080 in sales and marketing 528 in professional services and technical support and 270 in finance administration and operations none of our employees is represented by a labor union we have experienced no work stoppages and believe that our employee relations are good

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the other information in this report the following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating our company and its business 

our quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate in future periods which may cause our stock price to fluctuate 

our quarterly and annual operating results have varied significantly in the past and could vary significantly in the future which makes it difficult for us to predict our future operating results our operating results may fluctuate due to a variety of factors many of which are outside of our control including the changing and recently volatile us and global economic environment which may cause our stock price to fluctuate in particular we anticipate that the size of customer orders may increase as we continue to focus on larger business accounts a delay in the recognition of revenue even from just one account may have a significant negative impact on our results of operations for a given period in the past a majority of our sales have been realized near the end of a quarter accordingly a delay in an anticipated sale past the end of a particular quarter may negatively impact our results of operations for that quarter or in some cases that fiscal year additionally we have exposure to the credit risks of some of our customers and subtenants 

  

although we have programs in place that are designed to monitor and mitigate the associated risk there can be no assurance that such programs will be effective in reducing our credit risks adequately we monitor individual payment capability in granting credit arrangements seek to limit the total credit to amounts we believe our customers can pay and maintain reserves we believe are adequate to cover exposure for potential losses if there is a deterioration of a subtenant’s or a major customer’s creditworthiness or actual defaults are higher than expected future losses if incurred could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our operating results further our operating results may be below the expectations of securities analysts and investors in future quarters or years our failure to meet these expectations will likely harm the market price of our common stock such a decline could occur and has occurred in the past even when we have met our publicly stated revenue andor earnings guidance 

in addition to other risks listed in this “risk factors” section factors that may affect our operating results include but are not limited to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 our success depends on our timely development of new products and features market acceptance of new product offerings and proper management of the timing of the life cycle of our products 

the application delivery networking and file virtualization markets are characterized by rapid technological change frequent new product introductions changes in customer requirements and evolving industry standards our continued success depends on our ability to identify and develop new products and new features for our existing products to meet the demands of these changes and the acceptance of those products and features by our existing and target customers if we are unable to identify develop and deploy new products and new product features on a timely basis our business and results of operations may be harmed 

  

the current development cycle for our products is on average 1224 months the introduction of new products or product enhancements may shorten the life cycle of our existing products or replace sales of some of our current products thereby offsetting the benefit of even a successful product introduction and may cause customers to defer purchasing our existing products in anticipation of the new products this could harm our operating results by decreasing sales increasing our inventory levels of older products and exposing us to greater risk of product obsolescence we have also experienced and may in the future experience delays in developing and releasing new products and product enhancements this has led to and may in the future lead to delayed sales increased expenses and lower quarterly revenue than anticipated also in the development of our products we have experienced delays in the prototyping of our products which in turn has led to delays in product introductions in addition complexity and difficulties in managing product transitions at the endoflife stage of a product can create excess inventory of components associated with the outgoing product that can lead to increased expenses any or all of the above problems could materially harm our business and results of operations 

our success depends on sales and continued innovation of our application delivery networking product lines 

for the fiscal year ended september 30 2011 we derived approximately 974 of our net product revenues or approximately 610 of our total net revenues from sales of our application delivery networking adn product lines we expect to continue to derive a significant portion of our net revenues from sales of our adn products in the future implementation of our strategy depends upon these products being able to solve critical network availability and performance problems for our customers if our adn products are unable to solve these problems for our customers or if we are unable to sustain the high levels of innovation in our adn product feature set needed to maintain leadership in what will continue to be a competitive market environment our business and results of operations will be harmed 

we may not be able to compete effectively in the emerging application delivery networking and file virtualization markets 

the markets we serve are new rapidly evolving and highly competitive and we expect competition to persist and intensify in the future our principal competitors in the application delivery networking market include brocade communications systems inc cisco systems inc citrix systems inc and radware ltd in the adjacent wan optimization controller market we compete with blue coat systems inc cisco citrix juniper networks inc and riverbed technology inc in the file virtualization market we compete with emc corporation we expect to continue to face additional competition as new participants enter our markets as we continue to expand globally we may see new competitors in different geographic regions in addition larger companies with significant resources brand recognition and sales channels may form alliances with or acquire competing application delivery networking solutions from other companies and emerge as significant competitors potential competitors may bundle their products or incorporate an internet traffic management or security component into existing products in a manner that discourages users from purchasing our products any of these circumstances may limit our opportunities for growth and negatively impact our financial performance 

the average selling price of our products may decrease and our costs may increase which may negatively impact gross profits 

it is possible that the average selling prices of our products will decrease in the future in response to competitive pricing pressures increased sales discounts new product introductions by us or our competitors or other factors therefore in order to maintain our gross profits we must develop and introduce new products and product enhancements on a timely basis and continually reduce our product costs our failure to do so will cause our net revenue and gross profits to decline which will harm our business and results of operations in addition we may experience substantial periodtoperiod fluctuations in future operating results due to the erosion of our average selling prices 

it is difficult to predict our future operating results because we have an unpredictable sales cycle 

our products have a lengthy sales cycle and the timing of our revenue is difficult to predict historically our sales cycle has ranged from approximately two to three months and has tended to lengthen as we have increasingly focused our sales efforts on the enterprise market also as our distribution strategy has evolved into more of a channel model utilizing valueadded resellers distributors and systems integrators the level of variability in the length of sales cycle across transactions has increased and made it more difficult to predict the timing of many of our sales transactions sales of our products require us to educate potential customers in their use and benefits sales of our products are subject to delays from the lengthy internal budgeting approval and competitive evaluation processes that large corporations and governmental entities may require for example customers frequently begin by evaluating our products on a limited basis and devote time and resources to testing our products before they decide whether or not to purchase customers may also defer orders as a result of anticipated releases of new products or enhancements by our competitors or us as a result our products have an unpredictable sales cycle that contributes to the uncertainty of our future operating results 

  

our business may be harmed if our contract manufacturers are not able to provide us with adequate supplies of our products or if a single source of hardware assembly is lost or impaired 

we outsource the manufacturing of our hardware platforms to third party contract manufacturers who assemble these hardware platforms to our specifications we have experienced minor delays in shipments from contract manufacturers in the past however if we experience major delays in the future or other problems such as inferior quality and insufficient quantity of product any one or a combination of these factors may harm our business and results of operations the inability of our contract manufacturers to provide us with adequate supplies of our products or the loss of one or more of our contract manufacturers may cause a delay in our ability to fulfill orders while we obtain a replacement manufacturer and may harm our business and results of operations in particular we currently subcontract manufacturing of our application delivery networking products to a single contract manufacturer with whom we do not have a longterm contract if our arrangement with this single source of hardware assembly was terminated or otherwise impaired and we were not able to engage another contract manufacturer in a timely manner our business financial condition and results of operation could be adversely affected 

if the demand for our products grows we will need to increase our raw material and component purchases contract manufacturing capacity and internal test and quality control functions any disruptions in product flow may limit our revenue may harm our competitive position and may result in additional costs or cancellation of orders by our customers 

our business could suffer if there are any interruptions or delays in the supply of hardware components from our thirdparty sources 

we currently purchase several hardware components used in the assembly of our products from a number of single or limited sources lead times for these components vary significantly the unavailability of suitable components any interruption or delay in the supply of any of these hardware components or the inability to procure a similar component from alternate sources at acceptable prices within a reasonable time may delay assembly and sales of our products and hence our revenues and may harm our business and results of operations 

we are subject to governmental export and import controls that could subject us to liability or impair our ability to compete in international markets 

our products are subject to us export controls and may be exported outside the us only with the required level of export license or through an export license exception because we incorporate encryption technology into our products in addition various countries regulate the import of certain encryption technology and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute our products or our customers’ ability to implement our products in those countries changes in our products or changes in export and import regulations may create delays in the introduction of our products in international markets prevent our customers with international operations from deploying our products throughout their global systems or in some cases prevent the export or import of our products to certain countries altogether any change in export or import regulations or related legislation shift in approach to the enforcement or scope of existing regulations or change in the countries persons or technologies targeted by such regulations could result in decreased use of our products by or in our decreased ability to export or sell our products to existing or potential customers with international operations for example we will need to comply with waste electrical and electronic equipment directive laws which are being adopted by certain european economic area countries on a countrybycountry basis failure to comply with these and similar laws on a timely basis or at all could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition any decreased use of our products or limitation on our ability to export or sell our products would likely adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property and our products may infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties 

we rely on a combination of patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure of confidential and proprietary information to protect our intellectual property rights despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology monitoring unauthorized use of our products is difficult and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of our technology particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 

  

our industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the ordinary course of our business we are involved in disputes and licensing discussions with others regarding their claimed proprietary rights and cannot assure you that we will always successfully defend ourselves against such claims we expect that infringement claims may increase as the number of products and competitors in our market increases and overlaps occur also as we have gained greater visibility market exposure and competitive success we face a higher risk of being the subject of intellectual property infringement claims if we are found to infringe the proprietary rights of others or if we otherwise settle such claims we could be compelled to pay damages or royalties and either obtain a license to those intellectual property rights or alter our products so that they no longer infringe upon such proprietary rights any license could be very expensive to obtain or may not be available at all similarly changing our products or processes to avoid infringing upon the rights of others may be costly or impractical in addition we have initiated and may in the future initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to determine the scope and validity of our proprietary rights or those of our competitors any of these claims whether claims that we are infringing the proprietary rights of others or vice versa with or without merit may be timeconsuming result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel or require us to cease using infringing technology develop noninfringing technology or enter into royalty or licensing agreements further our license agreements typically require us to indemnify our customers distributors and resellers for infringement actions related to our technology which could cause us to become involved in infringement claims made against our customers distributors or resellers any of the abovedescribed circumstances relating to intellectual property rights disputes could result in our business and results of operations being harmed 

many of our products include intellectual property licensed from third parties in the future it may be necessary to renew licenses for third party intellectual property or obtain new licenses for other technology these third party licenses may not be available to us on acceptable terms if at all the inability to obtain certain licenses or litigation regarding the interpretation or enforcement of license rights and related intellectual property issues could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition furthermore we license some third party intellectual property on a nonexclusive basis and this may limit our ability to protect our intellectual property rights in our products 

we may not be able to sustain or develop new distribution relationships and a reduction or delay in sales to significant distribution partners could hurt our business 

we sell our products and services through multiple distribution channels in the united states and internationally including leading industry distributors valueadded resellers systems integrators service providers and other indirect channel partners we have a limited number of agreements with companies in these channels and we may not be able to increase our number of distribution relationships or maintain our existing relationships recruiting and retaining qualified channel partners and training them in our technologies requires significant time and resources if we are unable to establish or maintain our indirect sales channels our business and results of operations will be harmed in addition two worldwide distributors of our products accounted for 288 of our total net revenue for fiscal year 2011 two worldwide distributors of our products accounted for 247 of our total net revenue for fiscal year 2010 a substantial reduction or delay in sales of our products to these distribution partners if not replaced by sales to other indirect channel partners and distributors could harm our business operating results and financial condition 

undetected software or hardware errors may harm our business and results of operations 

our products may contain undetected errors or defects when first introduced or as new versions are released we have experienced these errors or defects in the past in connection with new products and product upgrades we expect that these errors or defects will be found from time to time in new or enhanced products after commencement of commercial shipments these problems may cause us to incur significant warranty and repair costs divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts and cause significant customer relations problems we may also be subject to liability claims for damages related to product errors or defects while we carry insurance policies covering this type of liability these policies may not provide sufficient protection should a claim be asserted a material product liability claim may harm our business and results of operations 

our products must successfully operate with products from other vendors as a result when problems occur in a network it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem the occurrence of software or hardware problems whether caused by our products or another vendor’s products may result in the delay or loss of market acceptance of our products the occurrence of any of these problems may harm our business and results of operations 

  

adverse general economic conditions or reduced information technology spending may adversely impact our business 

a substantial portion of our business depends on the demand for information technology by large enterprise customers and service providers the overall economic health of our current and prospective customers and the continued growth and evolution of the internet international national regional and local economic conditions such as recessionary economic cycles protracted economic slowdown or further deterioration of the economy could adversely impact demand for our products the purchase of our products is often discretionary and may involve a significant commitment of capital and other resources continued weak economic conditions or a reduction in information technology spending even if economic conditions improve would likely result in longer sales cycles and reduced product sales each of which would adversely impact our business results of operations and financial condition 

our investments in auction rate securities are subject to risks that may cause losses and affect the liquidity of these investments 

at september 30 2011 the fair value of our aaaa or equivalent rated municipal auction rate securities ars was approximately 130 million we may not be able to liquidate these ars and realize their full carrying value unless the issuer calls the security a successful auction occurs a buyer is found outside of the auction process or the security otherwise matures while we do not believe the decline in the carrying values of these municipal ars is permanent if the issuers of these securities are unable to successfully close future auctions and their credit ratings are lowered we may be required to record future impairment charges related to these investments which would harm our results of operations we believe certain of these availableforsale investments may remain illiquid for longer than twelve months and as a result we have classified these investments as longterm as of september 30 2011 

our operating results are exposed to risks associated with international commerce 

as our international sales increase our operating results become more exposed to international operating risks these risks include risks related to recessionary economic cycles or protracted slowdowns in economies outside the united states foreign currency exchange rates managing foreign sales offices regulatory political or economic conditions in specific countries military conflict or terrorist activities changes in laws and tariffs inadequate protection of intellectual property rights in foreign countries foreign regulatory requirements and natural disasters all of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business we intend to continue expanding into international markets international sales represented 412 and 414 of our net revenues for the fiscal years ended september 30 2011 and 2010 respectively 

changes in governmental regulations could negatively affect our revenues 

our products are subject to various regulations promulgated by the united states and various foreign governments including but not limited to environmental regulations and regulations implementing export license requirements and restrictions on the import or export of some technologies especially encryption technology changes in governmental regulation and our inability or failure to obtain required approvals permits or registrations could harm our international and domestic sales and adversely affect our revenues business and operations 

changes in financial accounting standards may cause adverse unexpected revenue fluctuations and affect our reported results of operations 

a change in accounting policies can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective new pronouncements and varying interpretations of existing pronouncements have occurred with frequency and may occur in the future changes to existing rules or changes to the interpretations of existing rules could lead to changes in our accounting practices and such changes could adversely affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business 

acquisitions present many risks and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that are contemplated at the time of the transaction 

with respect to our past acquisitions as well as any other future acquisitions we may undertake we may find that the acquired businesses products or technologies do not further our business strategy as expected that we paid more than what the assets are later worth or that economic conditions change all of which may generate future impairment charges our acquisitions may be viewed negatively by customers financial markets or investors there may be difficulty integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired business and we may have difficulty retaining the key personnel of the acquired business we may have difficulty in integrating the acquired technologies or products with our existing product lines our ongoing business and management’s attention 

  

may be disrupted or diverted by transition or integration issues and the complexity of managing geographically and culturally diverse locations we may have difficulty maintaining uniform standards controls procedures and policies across locations we may experience significant problems or liabilities associated with product quality technology and other matters 

our inability to successfully operate and integrate newlyacquired businesses appropriately effectively and in a timely manner or to retain key personnel of any acquired business could have a material adverse effect on our ability to take advantage of further growth in demand for integrated traffic management and security solutions and other advances in technology as well as on our revenues gross margins and expenses 

our success depends on our key personnel and our ability to attract and retain qualified sales and marketing operations product development and professional services personnel 

our success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our key management product development sales marketing and finance personnel many of whom may be difficult to replace the complexity of our application delivery networking products and their integration into existing networks and ongoing support as well as the sophistication of our sales and marketing effort requires us to retain highly trained professional services customer support and sales personnel competition for qualified professional services customer support and sales personnel in our industry is intense because of the limited number of people available with the necessary technical skills and understanding of our products our ability to retain and hire these personnel may be adversely affected by volatility or reductions in the price of our common stock since these employees are generally granted restricted stock units the loss of services of any of our key personnel the inability to retain and attract qualified personnel in the future or delays in hiring qualified personnel may harm our business and results of operations 

we face litigation risks 

we are a party to lawsuits in the normal course of our business litigation in general and intellectual property and securities litigation in particular can be expensive lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations moreover the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict responding to lawsuits has been and will likely continue to be expensive and timeconsuming for us an unfavorable resolution of these lawsuits could adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

antitakeover provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us 

our board of directors has the authority to issue up to 10000000 shares of preferred stock and to determine the price rights preferences privileges and restrictions including voting rights of those shares without any further vote or action by the shareholders the rights of the holders of common stock may be subject to and may be adversely affected by the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future the issuance of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a change of control of our company without further action by our shareholders and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of the holders of common stock further certain provisions of our bylaws including a provision limiting the ability of shareholders to raise matters at a meeting of shareholders without giving advance notice may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or management of our company which could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock in addition our articles of incorporation provide for a staggered board which may make it more difficult for a third party to gain control of our board of directors similarly state antitakeover laws in the state of washington related to corporate takeovers may prevent or delay a change of control of our company

 item 3 legal proceedings 

we are not aware of any pending legal proceedings that individually or in the aggregate are reasonably possible to have a material adverse effect on our business operating results or financial condition we may in the future be party to litigation arising in the ordinary course of business including claims that we allegedly infringe upon thirdparty intellectual property rights such claims even if not meritorious could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources

our management team monitors and analyzes a number of key performance indicators in order to manage our business and evaluate our financial and operating performance those indicators include 

 

  

  

   

  

 critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements 

revenue recognition we sell products through distributors resellers and directly to end users revenue is recognized provided that all of the following criteria have been met 

 

  

  

  

 in certain regions where we do not have the ability to reasonably estimate returns we defer revenue on sales to our distributors until they have received information from the channel partner indicating that the product has been sold to the enduser customer payment terms to domestic customers are generally net 30 days to net 45 days payment terms to international customers range from net 30 days to net 120 days based on normal and customary trade practices in the individual markets we offer extended payment terms to certain customers in which case revenue is recognized when payments are due 

whenever product training services and postcontract customer support pcs elements are sold together a portion of the sales price is allocated to each element based on their respective fair values as determined when the individual elements are sold separately revenue from the sale of products is recognized when the product has been shipped and the customer is obligated to pay for the product when rights of return are present and we cannot estimate returns we recognize revenue when such rights of return lapse revenues for pcs are recognized on a straightline basis over the service contract term pcs includes a limited period of telephone support updates repair or replacement of any failed product or component that fails during the term of the agreement bug fixes and rights to upgrades when and if available consulting services are customarily billed at fixed hourly rates plus outofpocket expenses and revenues are recognized when the consulting has been completed training revenue is recognized when the training has been completed 

  

in october 2009 the financial accounting standards board fasb amended the accounting standards for revenue recognition to remove from the scope of industryspecific software revenue recognition guidance any tangible products containing software components and nonsoftware components that operate together to deliver the products essential functionality in addition the fasb amended the accounting standards for certain multiple element revenue arrangements to 

 

  

  

 we adopted this guidance in the first quarter of fiscal year 2011 on a prospective basis for applicable arrangements originating or materially modified after october 1 2010 the impact of this adoption was not material to our financial position and results of operations for the fiscal year ended september 30 2011 

the majority of our products are hardware appliances that contain software essential to the overall functionality of the products accordingly we no longer recognize revenue on sales of these products in accordance with the industryspecific software revenue recognition guidance 

for all transactions entered into prior to the first quarter of fiscal year 2011 and for sales of nonessential and standalone software after october 1 2010 we allocate revenue for arrangements with multiple elements based on the software revenue recognition guidance software revenue recognition guidance requires revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements to be allocated to each element based on the relative fair values of those elements the fair value of an element must be based on vsoe where fair value of certain elements is not available revenue is recognized on the “residual method” based on the fair value of undelivered elements if evidence of the fair value of one or more undelivered elements does not exist all revenue is deferred and recognized at the earlier of the delivery of those elements or the establishment of fair value of the remaining undelivered elements 

for transactions entered into subsequent to the adoption of the amended revenue recognition standards that are multipleelement arrangements the arrangement consideration is allocated to each element based on the relative selling prices of all of the elements in the arrangement using the fair value hierarchy in the amended revenue recognition guidance 

consistent with the methodology used under the previous accounting guidance we establish vsoe for our products training services pcs and consulting services based on the sales price charged for each element when sold separately the sales price is discounted from the applicable list price based on various factors including the type of customer volume of sales geographic region and program level our list prices are generally not fair value as discounts may be given based on the factors enumerated above we believe that the fair value of our consulting services is represented by the billable consulting rate per hour based on the rates we charge customers when they purchase standalone consulting services the price of consulting services is not based on the type of customer volume of sales geographic region or program level 

we use historical sales transactions to determine whether vsoe can be established for each of the elements in most instances vsoe is the sales price of actual standalone unbundled transactions within the past 12 month period that are priced within a reasonable range which we have determined to be plus or minus 15 of the median sales price of each respective price list 

vsoe of pcs is based on standalone sales since we do not provide stated renewal rates to our customers in accordance with our pcs pricing practice supported by standalone renewal sales renewal contracts are priced as a percentage of the undiscounted product list price the pcs renewal percentages may vary depending on the type and length of pcs purchased we offer standard and premium pcs and the term generally ranges from one to three years we employ a bellshapedcurve approach in evaluating vsoe of fair value of pcs under this approach we consider vsoe of the fair value of pcs to exist when a substantial majority of our standalone pcs sales fall within a narrow range of pricing 

  

we are typically not able to determine tpe for our products or services tpe is based on competitor prices for similar elements when sold separately generally our gotomarket strategy differs from that of other competitive products or services in our markets and our offerings contain a significant level of differentiation such that the comparable pricing of products with similar functionality cannot be obtained furthermore we are unable to reliably determine the selling prices on a standalone basis of similar products offered by our competitors 

when we are unable to establish the selling price of our nonsoftware elements using vsoe or tpe we use besp in our allocation of arrangement consideration the objective of besp is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a standalone basis we are generally not able to establish vsoe for nonsoftware product sales under software revenue recognition guidance these product sales were accounted for utilizing the residual method with the adoption of the new revenue recognition guidance we have been able to establish besp for nonsoftware product sales through the list price less a discount deemed appropriate to maintain a reasonable gross margin management regularly reviews the gross margin information nonsoftware product besp is determined through our review of historical sales transactions within the past 12 month period additional factors considered in determining an appropriate besp include but are not limited to cost of products pricing practices geographies customer classes and distribution channels 

we have established and regularly validate the vsoe of fair value and besp for elements in our multiple element arrangements we account for taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities on a net basis and excluded from revenues 

reserve for doubtful accounts estimates are used in determining our allowance for doubtful accounts and are based upon an assessment of selected accounts and as a percentage of our remaining accounts receivable by aging category in determining these percentages we evaluate historical writeoffs current trends in the credit quality of our customer base as well as changes in the credit policies we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition and do not require any collateral if there is deterioration of a major customer’s credit worthiness or actual defaults are higher than our historical experience our allowance for doubtful accounts may not be sufficient 

reserve for product returns in some instances product revenue from distributors is subject to agreements allowing rights of return product returns are estimated based on historical experience and are recorded at the time revenues are recognized accordingly we reduce recognized revenue for estimated future returns at the time revenue is recorded when rights of return are present and we cannot estimate returns revenue is recognized when such rights lapse the estimates for returns are adjusted periodically based upon changes in historical rates of returns and other related factors it is possible that these estimates will change in the future or that the actual amounts could vary from our estimates 

accounting for income taxes we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure including assessing the risks associated with tax audits together with assessing temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities due to the evolving nature and complexity of tax rules combined with the large number of jurisdictions in which we operate it is possible that our estimates of our tax liability could change in the future which may result in additional tax liabilities and adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

stockbased compensation we account for stockbased compensation using the straightline attribution method for recognizing compensation expense over the requisite service period of the related award we recognized 897 million and 708 million of stockbased compensation expense for the years ended september 30 2011 and 2010 respectively as of september 30 2011 there was 1055 million of total unrecognized stockbased compensation cost the majority of which will be recognized over the next two years going forward stockbased compensation expenses may increase as we issue additional equitybased awards to continue to attract and retain key employees 

we issue incentive awards to our employees through stockbased compensation consisting of restricted stock units rsus the value of rsus is determined using the fair value method which in this case is based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock on the date of grant no stock options were granted in fiscal years 2011 2010 and 2009 

we recognize compensation expense for only the portion of rsus that are expected to vest therefore we apply estimated forfeiture rates that are derived from historical employee termination behavior based on historical differences with forfeitures of stockbased awards granted to our executive officers and board of directors versus grants awarded to all other employees we developed separate forfeiture expectations for these two groups in fiscal year 2011 the estimated forfeiture rate for grants awarded to our executive officers and board of directors was approximately 3 and the estimated forfeiture rate for grants awarded to all other employees was approximately 9 if the actual number of forfeitures differs from those estimated by management additional adjustments to stockbased compensation expense may be required in future periods 

  

we recognize compensation costs for awards with performance conditions when we conclude it is probable that the performance condition will be achieved we reassess the probability of vesting at each balance sheet date and adjust compensation costs based on our probability assessment 

common stock repurchase on october 26 2010 we announced that our board of directors approved a new program to repurchase up to an additional 200 million of our outstanding common stock our board of directors authorized an additional 200 million on august 15 2011 and an additional 200 million on october 25 2011 for our common stock share repurchase program these new authorizations are incremental to the existing 200 million program previously announced as authorized in october 2010 as of november 17 2011 we had repurchased and retired 7601631 shares at an average price of 5821 per share 

goodwill and intangible assets we have goodwill and intangible assets on our balance sheet related to acquisitions intangible assets are carried and reported at acquisition cost net of accumulated amortization subsequent to acquisition intangible assets are amortized over the estimated useful lives which generally range from three to five years intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate impairment might exist projected undiscounted net cash flows expected to be derived from the use of those assets are compared to the respective net carrying amounts to determine whether any impairment exists impairment if any is based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets 

the determination of the net carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets and the extent to which if any there is impairment are dependent on material estimates and judgments on our part including the useful life over which the intangible assets are to be amortized and the estimates of the value of future net cash flows which are based upon further estimates of future revenues expenses and operating margins we review our goodwill annually for impairment in the second fiscal quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable the first step of the test identifies whether potential impairment may have occurred while the second step of the test measures the amount of the impairment if any impairment is recognized when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its fair value in march 2011 we completed our annual impairment test and concluded that there was no impairment of goodwill we have considered the assumptions used in the test and noted that no reasonably possible changes would reduce the fair value of the reporting unit to such a level that would cause an impairment charge additionally we considered potential impairment indicators at september 30 2011 and noted no indicators of impairment 

investments our investments are diversified among highcredit quality debt securities in accordance with our investment policy we classify our investments as availableforsale which are reported at fair market value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss in stockholders’ equity realized gains and losses and declines in value of these investments judged to be other than temporary are included in other income expense to date we have not deemed it necessary to record any charges related to otherthantemporary declines in the estimated fair values of our marketable debt securities however the fair value of our investments is subject to volatility declines in the fair value of our investments judged to be other than temporary could adversely affect our future operating results 

our investments also include auction rate securities ars that are classified as availableforsale ars are reported at fair market value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss in stockholders’ equity we believe these investments may remain illiquid for longer than twelve months and as a result we have classified these investments as longterm as of september 30 2011 we used the income approach to determine the fair value of our ars using a discounted cash flow analysis the assumptions we used in preparing the discounted cash flow model include estimates for interest rates estimates for discount rates using yields of comparable traded instruments adjusted for illiquidity and other risk factors amount of cash flows and expected holding periods for the ars 

results of operations 

the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k

net service revenues increased 340 in fiscal year 2011 from fiscal year 2010 compared to an increase of 301 in fiscal year 2010 from the prior year the increases in service revenue were the result of increased purchases or renewals of maintenance contracts driven by additions to our installed base of products 

avnet technology solutions one of our worldwide distributors accounted for 181 145 and 154 of our total net revenues in fiscal years 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively ingram micro inc another worldwide distributor accounted for 107 of our total net revenues in fiscal year 2011 tech data another worldwide distributor accounted for 102 of our total net revenues in fiscal year 2010 avnet technology solutions and ingram micro inc accounted for 150 and 145 of our accounts receivable as of september 30 2011 respectively avnet technology solutions tech data and ingram micro inc accounted for 132 118 and 132 of our accounts receivable as of september 30 2010 respectively avnet technology solutions and ingram micro inc accounted for 116 and 107 of our accounts receivable as of september 30 2009 respectively no other distributors accounted for more than 10 of total net revenue or receivables for fiscal years 2011 2010 and 2009 

 

 cost of net product revenues cost of net product revenues consist of finished products purchased from our contract manufacturers manufacturing overhead freight warranty provisions for excess and obsolete inventory and amortization expenses in connection with developed technology from acquisitions cost of net product revenues increased 136 in fiscal year 2011 from the prior year primarily due to a higher volume of units shipped along with an increase in warranty expense cost of net product revenues increased to 1138 million in fiscal year 2010 from 952 million in fiscal year 2009 the year over year increase was primarily due to the higher volume of units shipped and an increase in warranty expense partially offset by a decrease in expense related to obsolete inventory product cost as a percentage of related net revenue decreased to 203 in fiscal year 2010 from 234 in fiscal year 2009 primarily due to reduced manufacturing costs and decreased indirect product costs 

cost of net service revenues cost of net service revenues consist of the salaries and related benefits of our professional services staff travel facilities and depreciation expenses cost of net service revenues as a percentage of net service revenues remained relatively consistent with the prior year at 183 cost of net service revenues as a percentage of net service revenues decreased to 181 in fiscal year 2010 from 193 in fiscal year 2009 primarily due to the scalability of our existing customer support infrastructure and increased revenue from maintenance contracts professional services headcount at the end of fiscal year 2011

restructuring beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2009 we implemented a comprehensive restructuring program as part of an overall initiative to reduce certain operating expenses restructuring actions included the consolidation of facilities accelerated depreciation on tenant improvements and a reduction in workforce in the second quarter of fiscal 2009 we recorded restructuring expenses of 43 million which included a 21 million charge for severance and related costs and a 22 million charge for the exit of certain offices worldwide all accrued restructuring costs had been incurred as of september 30 2011 

 

 other income net other income net consists primarily of interest income and foreign currency transaction gains and losses other income net increased 323 in fiscal year 2011 as compared to fiscal year 2010 and decreased 216 in fiscal year 2010 as compared to fiscal year 2009 interest income was 81 million 81 million and 99 million for fiscal years 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively the increase in other income net for fiscal year 2011 as compared to fiscal year 2010 was primarily due to a onetime charge of 15 million related to a legal settlement in fiscal year 2010 that was not incurred in fiscal year 2011 in addition foreign currency transaction gains increased 10 million compared to the prior year the decrease in other income net for fiscal year 2010 as compared to fiscal year 2009 was primarily due to decreased interest income of 18 million partially offset by increased foreign currency transaction gains of 10 million the decrease in interest income for fiscal year 2010 was primarily due to a decline in interest rates for the year 

provision for income taxes we recorded a 331 provision for income taxes for fiscal year 2011 compared to 364 in fiscal year 2010 and 305 in fiscal year 2009 the decrease in the effective tax rate from fiscal year 2010 to fiscal year 2011 was primarily due to an increased benefit resulting from the united states domestic production activities deduction the reinstatement of the federal research and development credit on december 17 2010 and a change in our uncertain tax positions as a result of the settlement of audits and expiration of statutes of limitation in various jurisdictions 

at september 30 2011 we did not have a valuation allowance on any of our deferred tax assets in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate because we believe that the assets are more likely than not to be realized in making this determination we have considered projected future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the appropriateness of a valuation allowance our net deferred tax assets as of fiscal year end 2011 2010 and 2009 were 432 million 466 million and 570 million respectively our worldwide effective tax rate may fluctuate based on a number of factors including variations in projected taxable income in our various geographic locations in which we operate changes in the valuation of our net deferred tax assets resolution of potential exposures tax positions taken on tax returns filed in the various geographic locations in which we operate and the introduction of new accounting standards or changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof in the various geographic locations in which we operate we have recorded liabilities to address potential tax exposures related to business and income tax positions we have taken that could be challenged by taxing authorities the ultimate resolution of these potential exposures may be greater or less than the liabilities recorded which could result in an adjustment to our future tax expense 

liquidity and capital resources 

we have funded our operations with our cash balances cash generated from operations and proceeds from public offerings of our securities 

  

 cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and longterm investments totaled 10128 million as of september 30 2011 compared to 8621 million as of september 30 2010 representing an increase of 1507 million the increase was primarily due to cash provided by operating activities of 4169 million for fiscal year 2011 compared to 3136 million for fiscal year 2010 which was partially offset by 2715 million of additional cash required for the repurchase of outstanding common stock under our share repurchase program in fiscal 2011 in fiscal year 2010 the increase was primarily due to cash provided by operating activities of 3136 million compared to 2020 million for fiscal year 2009 which was partially offset by 750 million of additional cash required for the repurchase of outstanding common stock under our share repurchase program in fiscal 2010 

at september 30 2011 we held 130 million in fair value of taxexempt ars which are variablerate debt securities and have a longterm maturity with the interest rates being reset through dutch auctions that are typically held every 7 28 or 35 days the securities have historically traded at par and are callable at par at the option of the issuer interest is typically paid at the end of each auction period or semiannually we limit our investments in ars to securities that carry a aaaa or equivalent rating from recognized rating agencies and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer at the time of initial investment and at the date of this annual report on form 10k all of our ars were in compliance with our investment policy 

beginning in february 2008 auctions failed for approximately 534 million in par value of municipal ars we held because sell orders exceeded buy orders when these auctions failed to clear higher interest rates for those securities went into effect however the funds associated with these failed auctions will not be accessible until the issuer calls the security a successful auction occurs a buyer is found outside of the auction process or the security matures 

we have no reason to believe that any of the underlying issuers of our ars are presently at risk of default the underlying assets of the municipal ars we hold including the securities for which auctions have failed are generally student loans that are guaranteed by the us government during fiscal years 2011 and 2010 we liquidated 40 million and 261 million of ars that we held at par value respectively through september 30 2011 we have continued to receive interest payments on the ars in accordance with their terms we believe we will be able to liquidate our investments without significant loss primarily due to the government guarantee of the underlying securities however due to uncertainty in the ars market we believe certain of these availableforsale investments may remain illiquid for longer than twelve months and as a result we have classified 150 million par value of our ars as longterm as of september 30 2011 

cash provided by operating activities during fiscal year 2011 was 4169 million compared to 3136 million in fiscal year 2010 and 2020 million in fiscal year 2009 cash provided by operating activities resulted primarily from cash generated from net income after adjusting for noncash charges such as stockbased compensation depreciation and amortization charges and changes in operating assets and liabilities 

cash used in investing activities during fiscal year 2011 was 1397 million compared to cash used in investing activities of 2382 million in fiscal year 2010 and cash used in investing activities of 991 million in fiscal year 2009 cash used in investing activities for fiscal year 2011 was primarily the result of the purchase of investments and capital expenditures related to maintaining our operations worldwide partially offset by the sale and maturity of investments cash used in investing activities for fiscal year 2010 was primarily the result of the purchase of investments and capital expenditures related to maintaining our operations worldwide partially offset by the sale and maturity of investments cash used in investing activities for fiscal year 2009 was primarily the result of the purchase of investments and capital expenditures related to maintaining our operations worldwide partially offset by the sale and maturity of investments 

cash used in financing activities was 2267 million for fiscal year 2011 compared to cash used in financing activities of 168 million for fiscal year 2010 and cash used in financing activities of 707 million for fiscal year 2009 cash used in financing activities for fiscal year 2011 included 2715 million to repurchase common stock under our share repurchase program which was partially offset by cash received from the exercise of employee stock options and stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan of 212 million and excess tax benefits related to sharebased compensation of 236 million cash used in financing activities for fiscal 2010 included 750 million to repurchase common stock under our share repurchase program which was partially offset by 

  

cash received from the exercise of employee stock options and stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan of 317 million and excess tax benefits related to sharebased compensation of 265 million cash used in financing activities for fiscal 2009 included 874 million to repurchase common stock under our share repurchase program which was partially offset by the exercise of employee stock options and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan 

based on our current operating and capital expenditure forecasts we believe that our existing cash and investment balances excluding ars together with cash generated from operations should be sufficient to meet our operating requirements for the next twelve months our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our rate of revenue growth the expansion of our sales and marketing activities the timing and extent of expansion into new territories the timing of introductions of new products and enhancements of existing products and the continuing market acceptance of our products 

obligations and commitments 

the following table summarizes our contractual payment obligations and commitments as of september 30 2011 

 

 we lease our facilities under operating leases that expire at various dates through 2022 

we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 48 “accounting for income taxes” on october 1 2007 as of september 30 2011 we had approximately 60 million of tax liabilities including interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions see note 5 to our consolidated financial statements because of the high degree of uncertainty regarding the settlement of these liabilities we are unable to estimate the years in which future cash outflows may occur 

purchase obligations are comprised of purchase commitments with our contract manufacturers the agreement with our primary contract manufacturer allows it to procure component inventory on our behalf based on our production forecast we are obligated to purchase component inventory that the contract manufacturer procures in accordance with the forecast unless cancellation is given within applicable lead times 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in may 2011 the fasb issued asu 201104 amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrs  asu 201104 which amends current fair value measurement and disclosure guidance to converge with international financial reporting standards ifrs and provides increased transparency around valuation inputs and investment categorization the amendments in this standard are effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december 15 2011 we will adopt asu 201104 in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 and do not expect the adoption of this standard to have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 

in june 2011 the fasb issued asu 201105 comprehensive income presentation of comprehensive income asu 201105 which eliminates the option of presenting other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders’ equity and instead requires the entity to present other comprehensive income as either a single statement of comprehensive income combined with net income or as two separate but continuous statements the amendments in this standard are to be applied retrospectively and are effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december 15 2011 we will adopt asu 201105 in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 and do not expect the adoption of this standard to have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 

in september 2011 the fasb issued asu 201108 intangibles—goodwill and other testing goodwill for impairment asu 201108 which simplifies how an entity tests goodwill for impairment by allowing the entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the twostep quantitative goodwill impairment test if an entity determines as a result of its qualitative assessment that it is morelikelythannot that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount the quantitative impairment test is required otherwise no further testing is required asu 201108 is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2011 with early adoption permitted we are likely to early adopt this standard for the goodwill impairment test to be performed in fiscal 2012 this standard will impact how we assess goodwill for impairment but will not change the measurement or recognition of a potential goodwill impairment charge 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

interest rate risk our cash equivalents consist of highquality securities as specified in our investment policy guidelines the policy limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue or issuer to a maximum of 5 of the total portfolio with the exception of us treasury and agency securities commercial paper and money market funds which are exempt from size limitation the policy requires investments in securities that mature in three years or less with the average maturity being no greater than one and a half years these securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if interest rates increase a decrease of one percent in the average interest rate would have resulted in a decrease of approximately 79 million in our interest income for the fiscal year 2011 

 

 at september 30 2011 the fair value of our aaaa or equivalent rated municipal ars was approximately 130 million ars are collateralized longterm debt instruments that provide liquidity through a dutch auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at predetermined intervals typically every 7 28 or 35 days beginning in february 2008 auctions failed for approximately 534 million in par value of municipal ars we held because sell orders exceeded buy orders when these auctions failed to clear higher interest rates for those securities went into effect however the funds associated with these failed auctions will not be accessible until the issuer calls the security a successful auction occurs a buyer is found outside of the auction process or the security matures the underlying assets of the municipal ars we hold including the securities for which auctions have failed are generally student loans that are guaranteed by the us government based on our expected operating cash flows and our other sources of cash we do not believe that any reduction in liquidity of our municipal ars will have a material impact on our overall ability to meet our liquidity needs we have no intent to sell won’t be required to sell and believe we will hold these securities until recovery we believe certain of these availableforsale investments may remain illiquid for longer than twelve months and as a result we have classified 150 million par value of securities as longterm as of september 30 2011 

foreign currency risk the majority of our sales and expenses are denominated in us dollars and as a result we have not experienced significant foreign currency transaction gains and losses to date while we have conducted some transactions in foreign currencies during the fiscal year ended september 30 2011 and expect to continue to do so we do not anticipate that foreign currency transaction gains or losses will be significant at our current level of operations however as we continue to expand our operations internationally transaction gains or losses may become significant in the future we have not engaged in foreign currency hedging to date however we may do so in the future

our management with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief accounting officer evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of september 30 2011 and based on this evaluation our chief executive officer and chief accounting officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of september 30 2011 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in exchange act rules 13a15f and 15d15f internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 

internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override because of such limitations there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting however these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process therefore it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce though not eliminate this risk 

management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of september 30 2011 in making this assessment management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission in internal control — integrated framework  based on the results of this assessment and on those criteria management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of september 30 2011 

pricewaterhousecoopers llp an independent registered public accounting firm has audited the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k and as part of their audit has issued its attestation report included herein on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting

industry background 

 

growth and evolution of ipbased infrastructures 

 

internet protocol ip is a communications language used to transmit data over the internet since the late 1990s businesses have responded to the power flexibility and efficiency of the internet by replacing older data center architectures with ipbased infrastructures deploying new ipbased applications and replacing or upgrading legacy applications with new ipenabled versions at the same time organizations have become more geographically dispersed and increasingly mobile workforces depend on access to corporate applications and data from remote locations and a variety of client devices such as mobile telephones personal digital assistants and notebook computers 

 

more recently companies and other large enterprises have responded to the global economic downturn by using technologies such as virtualization and the growing availability and sophistication of cloud computing to overhaul their computing infrastructures and make them more flexible and efficient in the wake of reduced headcounts many companies are also adding more intelligence in their networks to enable them to compete more effectively in an environment of reduced consumer spending these efforts are reflected in the 

widespread trend toward data center consolidation that includes both a reduction in the number and size of data centers 

 

meanwhile the evolution and proliferation of mobile devices and applications coupled with the global embrace of social media sites such as facebook and twitter have challenged the abilities of content and service providers to keep up with growing demand 

 

over the near term we believe data center consolidation will continue to drive demand for intelligent technologies that enable companies and other organizations to be more efficient and competitive longer term we believe that the growth of internet usage driven by new applications the proliferation of social media sites the growth of mobile data traffic and the adoption of ondemand usage and infrastructure models such as cloud computing will continue to drive demand for more intelligent and dynamic ip networks 

 

in conjunction with the growth of internet traffic the proliferation of data particularly unstructured data such as voice video images email spreadsheets and formatted text files presents an enormous and increasing challenge to it organizations along with the growing volume of unstructured data that is businesscritical and must be retained and readily accessible to individuals and applications new regulations mandate that company email web pages and other files must be retained for extended periods of time in response to this challenge it organizations spend an increasing amount of their budget on nas and other types of storage systems 

 

trend towards virtualization 

 

from a broad perspective the goal of it organizations is to optimize the secure delivery of applications and data to users wherever they are and whenever they need them to achieve this goal organizations are embracing virtualization technologies that enable them to group or partition data center resources to meet user demand and reconfigure these virtual resources easily and quickly as demand changes server virtualization which allows organizations to improve utilization of physical servers by partitioning them into multiple virtual servers is well known and widely deployed application delivery controllers free up both physical and virtual server processing power by offloading common functions such as encryption and compression from multiple physical or virtual servers and dynamically manage the flow of traffic between users and both virtual and physical servers making them look like a single resource to the user server virtualization puts additional pressure on storage resources by increasing the demand for storage capacity and the complexity of storing and retrieving files sitting in front of storage systems file virtualization devices perform functions similar to application delivery controllers presenting the appearance of a single resource to users and applications and dynamically managing the transfer of files between users applications and multiple storage devices 

 

application delivery networking 

 

internet traffic passing between client devices and servers is divided into discrete packets which travel by multiple routes to their destination where they are reassembled the disassembly routing and reassembly of transmissions are relatively straightforward and require little intelligence by contrast application delivery networking — managing inspecting modifying redirecting and securing application traffic going to and from servers — requires intelligent systems capable of performing a broad array of functions 

 

basic application delivery networking adn functions include loadbalancing distributing traffic across multiple servers while making them appear to be a single server and healthchecking monitoring the performance of servers and applications to ensure that they are working properly before routing traffic to them in addition adn encompasses a growing number of functions that have typically been performed by the server or the application itself or by point solutions running on separate devices these include 

 

 4 

 

  

since most large enterprises have hundreds — if not thousands — of servers and applications it is not practical to replicate these functions on each server or build them into the applications themselves even if it were maintenance costs would be prohibitive and the net result would be a negative impact on the overall performance of servers and applications deploying point solutions in the network eliminates those problems but creates a new set of challenges using point solutions from multiple vendors can create interoperability issues and problems that do occur can be difficult to troubleshoot from a security standpoint it is also much more difficult to audit traffic passing through multiple devices as a result enterprise customers are increasingly demanding products that integrate adn functions on a single platform 

 

file virtualization 

 

along with other types of ip traffic the volume of filebased information created and accessed by internet users and network applications is growing rapidly according to some estimates the volume of unstructured files is expected to triple annually over the next several years the challenge of storing and managing unstructured files is becoming increasingly costly and complex and reducing the cost and complexity is quickly moving up the list of data center priorities 

 

in many large organizations whose employees are geographically dispersed unstructured data is stored on local file servers which are difficult to manage costly to maintain and generally underutilized information on these devices is easy for local users to access but often inaccessible to others in the organization to reduce the cost complexity and redundancy of dispersed file systems many it organizations are consolidating file storage on centralized nas devices and other types of storage systems migrating and consolidating files is difficult and timeconsuming however and centralized storage systems pose a different set of problems 

 

centralized storage of files can slow access for remote users and applications spurring interest in technology that can speed the transfer of files across wide area networks wans in addition only users and applications that are physically mapped to a specific drive can store and access data on that drive as the drive 

fills up files must be moved manually to a new drive and affected users and applications must be remapped to that drive in large organizations this often constitutes a roundtheclock chore for many highlyskilled employees 

 

another major storage problem stems from the fact that all files are not created equal many businesses and other organizations have policies or other obligations to retain email and other files increasing the volume of data to archive and in some cases keep indefinitely since it is unlikely that these files will be accessed frequently if at all in the course of normal business it makes little sense to store them on expensive highperformance systems designed to provide immediate access to businesscritical information as a result it organizations are beginning to deploy tiers of storage systems that match cost capacity and performance to the type of information being stored how frequently it is accessed and its relative importance to the business often the most costeffective solution is a combination of storage systems from different vendors an approach that typically entails migrating huge amounts of data between incompatible devices once that is completed organizations face the challenge of automating the tiering process and the management of aging files 

 

whether or not they deploy tiered file systems many organizations are beginning to address the mounting cost in time and resources of backing up data stored on employee desktops local file servers and other devices according to some estimates approximately 80 of the files organizations back up have not changed since the previous backup worse yet a large and growing percentage are music and video files family photographs and other personal files 

 

responding to increasing demand from it organizations a number of storage vendors and a handful of other companies offer solutions that address some or all of these issues and can be loosely grouped under the heading of file virtualization collectively these solutions encompass a variety of technological approaches designed to optimize and simplify the storage of unstructured data 

 

f5 solutions 

 

application delivery networking 

 

f5 networks is a leading provider of application delivery networking products that ensure the security optimization and availability of applications for any user anywhere we believe our products offer the most intelligent architecture and advanced functionality in the marketplace along with performance and flexibility that enable organizations to simplify management of their data center operations and integrate disparate resources to reduce operating costs and improve service to employees customers and partners 

 

software based products from inception we have been committed to the belief that the complexity of applicationlevel processing requires the flexibility of a softwarebased solution we believe our modular software architecture enables us to deliver the broadest range of integrated functionality in the market and facilitates the addition and integration of new functionality we also believe that integrating our software with hardware components enables us to build products that deliver superior performance functionality and flexibility at competitive prices we have introduced virtual software only versions of bigip ltm and firepass to provide our customers with versions that complement our hardware based platforms 

 

full proxy architecture the core of our software technology is tmos introduced in september 2004 we believe tmos is a major enhancement of our previous technology that enables our products to deliver functionality that is superior on many levels to any other application delivery networking product in the market with tmos our products can inspect modify and direct both inbound and outbound traffic flows across multiple packets this ability to manage application traffic to and from servers adds value to applications that pass through our devices in ways that are not possible with other application delivery networking solutions in april 2009 we introduced a major upgrade version 100 of tmos that includes more than 130 new features more than 90 applicationready solution templates and a number of performance enhancements all designed to leverage the advanced features and performance of our recently upgraded family of bigip hardware platforms since then we have introduced tmos versions 101 and 102 which include support for clustered multiprocessing and many new features and functions specifically designed to optimize virtual data centers and enable ondemand access to internal and external resources 

modular functionality in addition to its full proxy architecture tmos is designed to facilitate the development and integration of application delivery networking functions as modules that can be added to bigip’s core functionality to keep pace with rapidly evolving customer needs feature modules that are available as add ons to tmos version 100 include advanced client authentication advanced routing fast cache intelligent compression ipv6 gateway l7 rate shaping message security module protocol security module and ssl acceleration product modules include local traffic manager application security manager asm global traffic manager gtm link controller webaccelerator edge gateway wan optimization module and access policy manager 

 

application awareness the open architecture of tmos includes an application programming interface api called icontrol that allows our products to communicate with one another and with thirdparty software and devices through this unique feature thirdparty applications and network devices can take an active role in shaping ip network traffic directing traffic based on exact business requirements defined by our customers and solutions partners and tailored to specific applications this “application awareness” capability is a key feature of our softwarebased products and further differentiates our solutions from those of our competitors 

 

applicationspecific configurations developed and tested in collaboration with our solutions partners application ready solutions are configurations designed to optimize bigip deployments for specific applications such as those provided by oracle microsoft siebel and sap as well as generic applications delivered via http with tmos version 100 we introduced templates that reduce the time and effort necessary to configure bigip for a specific application the configuration created is optimal for bigip devices and the specific application for which the template was created and can be further customized for the specific conditions of an organization’s unique infrastructure and environment like other configuration details of bigip devices these templates can easily be shared across multiple bigip deployments 

 

adaptive intelligence the fullproxy capabilities of tmos enable it to inspect or “read” the entire contents of a transmission across multiple packets and identify specific elements of that transmission including items such as names dates and any type of number or label by taking advantage of our unique scripting capability based on tcl customers can use those elements as variables to create irules that modify the content and direct the flow of traffic in ways tailored to the dynamic needs of their applications irules is a unique feature of tmos that gives our products flexibility we believe is unmatched by competing products 

 

integrated application layer solutions the combination of our full proxy architecture and enhanced irules enables bigip to intercept inspect and act on the contents of traffic from virtually every type of ipenabled application in addition the modularity of the tmos architecture allows us to deliver tightly integrated solutions that secure optimize and ensure the availability of applications and the networks they run on

product development 

 

we believe our future success depends on our ability to maintain technology leadership by continuing to improve our products and by developing new products to meet the changing needs of our customers our product development group employs a standard process for the development documentation and quality control of software and systems that is designed to meet these goals this process includes working with our business development and marketing teams product managers customers and partners to identify new or improved solutions that meet the evolving needs of our addressable markets 

 

our principal software engineering group is located in our headquarters in seattle washington our core product development teams for firepass wom and webaccelerator are located in san jose california our core asm product development team is located in tel aviv israel our arx product development team is located in lowell massachusetts our hardware engineering group is located in spokane washington in addition we maintain a dedicated facility for product testing and quality control in tomsk russia members of all these teams collaborate closely with one another to ensure the interoperability and performance of our hardware and software systems 

 

during the fiscal years ended september 30 2010 2009 and 2008 we had research and product development expenses of 1183 million 1037 million and 1034 million respectively 

 

customers 

 

our customers include a wide variety of enterprise customers and service providers among fortune 1000 and business week global 1000 companies including those in technology telecommunications financial services transportation education manufacturing and healthcare along with government customers in fiscal year 2010 international sales represented 414 of our net revenues refer to note 12 of our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding our revenues by geographic area 

sales and marketing 

 

sales 

 

we sell our products and services to large enterprise customers and service providers through a variety of channels including distributors valueadded resellers “vars” and systems integrators a substantial amount of our revenue for fiscal year 2010 was derived from these channel sales our sales teams work closely with our channel partners and also sell our products and services directly to a limited number of major accounts 

 

f5 sales teams our inside sales team generates and qualifies leads for regional sales managers and helps manage accounts by serving as a liaison between the field and internal corporate resources our field sales personnel are located in major cities in four sales regions the americas primarily the united states europe the middle east and africa emea japan and the asia pacific region apac field sales personnel work closely with our channel partners to assist them as necessary in the sale of our products and services to their customers we also sell our products and services directly to a limited group of customers primarily large enterprises whose accounts are managed by our major account services team field systems engineers support our regional sales managers and channel partners by participating in joint sales calls and providing presale technical resources as needed 

 

distributors and vars consistent with our goal of building a strong channel sales model we have established relationships with a number of large national and international distributors local and specialized distributors and vars we derive a majority of our product sales from these distributors and vars 

 

our agreements with these channel partners are not exclusive and do not prevent them from selling competitive products these agreements typically have terms of one year with no obligation to renew and typically do not provide for exclusive sales territories or minimum purchase requirements 

 

for fiscal year 2010 sales to two of our distributors avnet technology solutions and tech data represented 145 and 102 of our total revenues respectively our agreements with these distributors are standard nonexclusive distribution agreements that renew automatically on an annual basis and can be terminated by either party with 30 days prior written notice the agreements grant avnet technology solutions and tech data the right to distribute our products to resellers in north america and certain other territories internationally with no minimum purchase requirements 

 

systems integrators we also market our products through strategic relationships with systems integrators including dell services hp enterprise services and ibm global services who include our products as core components of application or networkbased solutions they deploy for their customers in most cases systems integrators do not directly purchase our products for resale to their customers instead they typically recommend our products as part of broader solutions such as enterprise resource planning erp or customer relationship management crm solutions that incorporate our products for high availability and enhanced performance 

 

marketing 

 

our marketing strategy is driven by the belief that our continued success depends on our ability to understand and anticipate the dynamic needs of our addressable markets and to develop valuable solutions that meet those needs in line with this belief our marketing organization works directly with customers partners and our product development teams to identify and create innovative solutions to further enhance our leadership position in addition our business development team which is a component of our marketing organization closely monitors technology companies in adjacent and complementary markets for opportunities to acquire or partner with those whose solutions are complementary to ours and could enable us to expand our addressable market 

 

another key component of our marketing strategy is to develop and expand our icontrol partnerships working closely with our partners we have developed solution sets called application ready solutions that help ensure the successful deployment and delivery of their applications over the network these solutions have been integrated into tmos version 100 as templates that allow customers to configure our products 

quickly and easily to optimize the performance of specific applications from major software vendors such as microsoft oracle and sap 

 

to support the growing number of developers using our products including network and application architects we continue to promote and expand devcentral our online community website that provides technical resources to customers prospects and partners wanting to extend and optimize f5 solutions using irules a key aspect of devcentral is an online forum where developers as well as application and network architects discuss and share solutions they have written with irules at the end of fiscal year 2010 devcentral had more than 70000 registered members 

 

we also engage in a number of marketing programs and initiatives aimed at promoting our brand and creating market awareness of our technology and products these include actively participating in industry trade shows and joint marketing events with channel and technology partners and briefing industry analysts and members of the trade press on our latest products business relationships and technology partnerships in addition we market our products to chief information officers and other information technology professionals through targeted advertising direct mail and highprofile web events 

 

backlog 

 

at the end of fiscal years 2010 and 2009 we had product backlog of approximately 503 million and 355 million respectively backlog represents orders confirmed with a purchase order for products to be shipped generally within 90 days to customers with approved credit status orders are subject to cancellation rescheduling by customers or product specification changes by customers although we believe that the backlog orders are firm purchase orders may be cancelled by the customer prior to shipment without significant penalty for this reason we believe that our product backlog at any given date is not a reliable indicator of future revenues 

 

customer service and technical support 

 

we believe that our ability to provide consistent highquality customer service and technical support is a key factor in attracting and retaining large enterprise customers accordingly we offer a broad range of support services that include installation phone support hardware repair and replacement software updates consulting and training services we deliver these services directly to end users and also utilize a multitiered support model leveraging the capabilities of our channel partners when applicable our technical support staff is strategically located in regional service centers to support our global customer base 

 

prior to the installation of our products our services personnel work with customers to analyze their network needs and determine the best way to deploy our products and configure product features and functions to meet those needs our services personnel also provide onsite installation and training services to help customers make optimal use of product features and functions 

 

our customers typically purchase a oneyear maintenance contract which entitles them to an array of services provided by our technical support team maintenance services provided under the contract include online updates software error correction releases hardware repair and replacement and in the majority of cases roundtheclock call center support updates to our software are only available to customers with a current maintenance contract our technical support team also offers seminars and training classes for customers on the configuration and use of products including local and wide area network system administration and management in addition we have a professional services team able to provide a full range of feebased consulting services including comprehensive network management documentation and performance analysis and capacity planning to assist in predicting future network requirements 

 

we also offer as part of our maintenance service an online automated selfhelp customer support function called “ask f5” that allows customers to answer many commonly asked questions without having to call our support desk this allows the customer to rapidly address issues and questions while significantly reducing the number of calls to our support desk this enables us to provide comprehensive customer support while keeping our supportrelated expenses at a manageable consistent level 

manufacturing 

 

we outsource the manufacturing of our preconfigured hardware platforms to third party contract manufacturers for assembly according to our specifications 

 

we outsource the majority of our manufacturing to tier 1 electronic manufacturing services providers flextronics manufactures our adc product line and sanminasci manufactures our arx product line the subcontracting activity at flextronics and sanminasci encompasses prototype builds full production and direct fulfillment our contract manufacturers perform the following activities on our behalf material procurement pcb assembly and test final assembly system test quality control direct shipment and warranty repairs we provide a rolling forecast that allows our contract manufacturers to stock component parts and other materials plan capacity and build finished goods inventory in anticipation of end user demand each of the contract manufacturers procures components in volumes consistent with our forecast necessary to assemble the products and tests the products according to our specifications products are then shipped to our distributors valueadded resellers or end users generally we do not own the components title to the products transfers from the contract manufacturers to us and then to our customers upon delivery at a designated shipment location if the components are unused or the products are not sold within specified periods of time we may incur carrying charges or obsolete material charges for components that our contract manufacturers purchased to build products to meet our forecast or customer orders 

 

hardware platforms for our products consist primarily of commodity parts and certain custom components designed and approved by our hardware engineering group most of our components are purchased from sources which we believe are readily available from other suppliers however several components used in the assembly of our products are purchased from a single or limited source 

 

during fiscal year 2010 we transitioned certain subassembly and testing processes of our bigip products from flextronics’s facilities in milpitas california to the flextronics facility in zhuhai china all subassemblies are configured and final tested at flextronics’s milpitas california for distribution to our end users 

 

competition 

 

the expanding capabilities of our product offerings have enabled us to address a growing array of opportunities many of which are outside the bounds of the traditional layer 47 market within what gartner group has defined as the application acceleration market we compete in the application delivery controller adc market which encompasses the traditional layer 47 market and to a lesser extent the wan optimization controller woc market over the next several years we believe these two markets will merge as wan optimization effectively becomes a feature of application delivery today we offer webaccelerator and wom as software modules on most all bigip products 

 

in fiscal year 2010 approximately 95 of our products and services were sold into the adn market where our primary competitor is cisco systems inc other competitors in this market include citrix systems inc brocade communications systems inc radware ltd and a number of smaller competitors including a10 networks array networks inc barracuda networks inc crescendo networks and zeus technology ltd in the adjacent wan optimization controller market we compete with riverbed technology inc juniper networks inc blue coat systems inc cisco and citrix currently we do not compete in the branch office segment of the woc market which features products offered by riverbed blue coat cisco and others 

 

while file virtualization remains an earlystage market we believe our arx products are unique in terms of technology and functionality and are well positioned within this emerging market large storage vendors such as emc corporation offer competing products with overlapping functionality however we believe there are no competing products that offer all of the features functions and capabilities of our arx products 

 

the principal competitive factors in the markets in which we compete include product performance and features customer support brand recognition the scope of distribution and sales channels and pricing many of our competitors have a longer operating history and greater financial technical marketing and other resources than we do these larger competitors also have a more extensive customer base and broader 

customer relationships including relationships with many of our current and potential customers in addition many have large wellestablished worldwide customer support and professional services organizations and more extensive direct sales force and sales channels because of our relatively smaller size market presence and resources our larger competitors may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements these companies may also adopt aggressive pricing policies to gain market share 

 

intellectual property 

 

we rely on a combination of patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights we have obtained 69 patents in the united states 8 foreign patents and have applications pending for various aspects of our technology our future success depends in part on our ability to protect our proprietary rights to the technologies used in our principal products despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use trade secrets or other information that we regard as proprietary in addition the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights as fully as do the laws of the united states any issued patent may not preserve our proprietary position and competitors or others may develop technologies similar to or superior to our technology our failure to enforce and protect our intellectual property rights could harm our business operating results and financial condition 

 

in addition to our own proprietary software we incorporate software licensed from several thirdparty sources into our products these licenses generally renew automatically on an annual basis we believe that alternative technologies for these licenses are available both domestically and internationally 

 

employees 

 

as of september 30 2010 we had 2012 fulltime employees including 509 in product development 856 in sales and marketing 421 in professional services and technical support and 226 in finance administration and operations none of our employees are represented by a labor union we have experienced no work stoppages and believe that our employee relations are good

 item 1a   risk factors tableend  

in addition to the other information in this report the following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating our company and its business 

 

our quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate in future periods which may cause our stock price to fluctuate 

 

our quarterly and annual operating results have varied significantly in the past and could vary significantly in the future which makes it difficult for us to predict our future operating results our operating results may fluctuate due to a variety of factors many of which are outside of our control including the changing and recently volatile us and global economic environment and any of which may cause our stock price to fluctuate in particular we anticipate that the size of customer orders may increase as we continue to focus on larger business accounts a delay in the recognition of revenue even from just one account may have a significant negative impact on our results of operations for a given period in the past a majority of our sales have been realized near the end of a quarter accordingly a delay in an anticipated sale past the end of a particular quarter may negatively impact our results of operations for that quarter or in some cases that fiscal year additionally we have exposure to the credit risks of some of our customers and subtenants although we have programs in place that are designed to monitor and mitigate the associated risk there can be no assurance that such programs will be effective in reducing our credit risks adequately we monitor individual payment capability in granting credit arrangements seek to limit the total credit to amounts we believe our customers can pay and maintain reserves we believe are adequate to cover exposure for potential losses if there is a deterioration of a subtenant’s or a major customer’s creditworthiness or actual defaults are higher than expected future losses if incurred could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our operating results further our operating results may be below the expectations of securities analysts and investors in future quarters or years our failure to meet these expectations will likely harm the market price of our common stock such a decline could occur and has occurred in the past even when we have met our publicly stated revenue andor earnings guidance 

 

in addition to other risks listed in this “risk factors” section factors that may affect our operating results include but are not limited to 

 

 18 

 

  

our success depends on our timely development of new products and features market acceptance of new product offerings and proper management of the timing of the life cycle of our products 

 

the application delivery networking and file virtualization markets are characterized by rapid technological change frequent new product introductions changes in customer requirements and evolving industry standards our continued success depends on our ability to identify and develop new products and new features for our existing products to meet the demands of these changes and the acceptance of those products and features by our existing and target customers if we are unable to identify develop and deploy new products and new product features on a timely basis our business and results of operations may be harmed 

 

the current development cycle for our products is on average 1224 months the introduction of new products or product enhancements may shorten the life cycle of our existing products or replace sales of some of our current products thereby offsetting the benefit of even a successful product introduction and may cause customers to defer purchasing our existing products in anticipation of the new products this could harm our operating results by decreasing sales increasing our inventory levels of older products and exposing us to greater risk of product obsolescence we have also experienced and may in the future experience delays in developing and releasing new products and product enhancements this has led to and may in the future lead to delayed sales increased expenses and lower quarterly revenue than anticipated also in the development of our products we have experienced delays in the prototyping of our products which in turn has led to delays in product introductions in addition complexity and difficulties in managing product transitions at the endoflife stage of a product can create excess inventory of components associated with the outgoing product that can lead to increased expenses any or all of the above problems could materially harm our business and results of operations 

 

our success depends on sales and continued innovation of our application delivery networking product lines 

 

for the fiscal year ended september 30 2010 we derived approximately 954 of our net product revenues or approximately 607 of our total net revenues from sales of our application delivery networking “adn” product lines we expect to continue to derive a significant portion of our net revenues from sales of our adn products in the future implementation of our strategy depends upon these products being able to solve critical network availability and performance problems for our customers if our adn products are unable to solve these problems for our customers or if we are unable to sustain the high levels of innovation in our adn product feature set needed to maintain leadership in what will continue to be a competitive market environment our business and results of operations will be harmed 

 

we may not be able to compete effectively in the emerging application delivery networking and file virtualization markets 

 

the markets we serve are new rapidly evolving and highly competitive and we expect competition to persist and intensify in the future our principal competitors in the application delivery networking market include cisco systems inc citrix systems inc brocade communications systems inc and radware ltd in the adjacent wan optimization controller market we compete with riverbed technology inc juniper networks inc blue coat systems inc cisco and citrix in the file virtualization market we compete with 

emc corporation we expect to continue to face additional competition as new participants enter our markets as we continue to expand globally we may see new competitors in different geographic regions in addition larger companies with significant resources brand recognition and sales channels may form alliances with or acquire competing application delivery networking solutions from other companies and emerge as significant competitors potential competitors may bundle their products or incorporate an internet traffic management or security component into existing products in a manner that discourages users from purchasing our products any of these circumstances may limit our opportunities for growth and negatively impact our financial performance 

 

the average selling price of our products may decrease and our costs may increase which may negatively impact gross profits 

 

it is possible that the average selling prices of our products will decrease in the future in response to competitive pricing pressures increased sales discounts new product introductions by us or our competitors or other factors therefore in order to maintain our gross profits we must develop and introduce new products and product enhancements on a timely basis and continually reduce our product costs our failure to do so will cause our net revenue and gross profits to decline which will harm our business and results of operations in addition we may experience substantial periodtoperiod fluctuations in future operating results due to the erosion of our average selling prices 

 

it is difficult to predict our future operating results because we have an unpredictable sales cycle 

 

our products have a lengthy sales cycle and the timing of our revenue is difficult to predict historically our sales cycle has ranged from approximately two to three months and has tended to lengthen as we have increasingly focused our sales efforts on the enterprise market also as our distribution strategy has evolved into more of a channel model utilizing valueadded resellers distributors and systems integrators the level of variability in the length of sales cycle across transactions has increased and made it more difficult to predict the timing of many of our sales transactions sales of our products require us to educate potential customers in their use and benefits sales of our products are subject to delays from the lengthy internal budgeting approval and competitive evaluation processes that large corporations and governmental entities may require for example customers frequently begin by evaluating our products on a limited basis and devote time and resources to testing our products before they decide whether or not to purchase customers may also defer orders as a result of anticipated releases of new products or enhancements by our competitors or us as a result our products have an unpredictable sales cycle that contributes to the uncertainty of our future operating results 

 

our business may be harmed if our contract manufacturers are not able to provide us with adequate supplies of our products or if a single source of hardware assembly is lost or impaired 

 

we outsource the manufacturing of our hardware platforms to third party contract manufacturers who assemble these hardware platforms to our specifications we have experienced minor delays in shipments from contract manufacturers in the past however if we experience major delays in the future or other problems such as inferior quality and insufficient quantity of product any one or a combination of these factors may harm our business and results of operations the inability of our contract manufacturers to provide us with adequate supplies of our products or the loss of one or more of our contract manufacturers may cause a delay in our ability to fulfill orders while we obtain a replacement manufacturer and may harm our business and results of operations in particular we currently subcontract manufacturing of our application delivery networking products to a single contract manufacturer with whom we do not have a longterm contract if our arrangement with this single source of hardware assembly was terminated or otherwise impaired and we were not able to engage another contract manufacturer in a timely manner our business financial condition and results of operation could be adversely affected 

 

if the demand for our products grows we will need to increase our raw material and component purchases contract manufacturing capacity and internal test and quality control functions any disruptions in 

product flow may limit our revenue may harm our competitive position and may result in additional costs or cancellation of orders by our customers 

 

our business could suffer if there are any interruptions or delays in the supply of hardware components from our thirdparty sources 

 

we currently purchase several hardware components used in the assembly of our products from a number of single or limited sources lead times for these components vary significantly the unavailability of suitable components any interruption or delay in the supply of any of these hardware components or the inability to procure a similar component from alternate sources at acceptable prices within a reasonable time may delay assembly and sales of our products and hence our revenues and may harm our business and results of operations 

 

we are subject to governmental export and import controls that could subject us to liability or impair our ability to compete in international markets 

 

our products are subject to us export controls and may be exported outside the us only with the required level of export license or through an export license exception because we incorporate encryption technology into our products in addition various countries regulate the import of certain encryption technology and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute our products or our customers’ ability to implement our products in those countries changes in our products or changes in export and import regulations may create delays in the introduction of our products in international markets prevent our customers with international operations from deploying our products throughout their global systems or in some cases prevent the export or import of our products to certain countries altogether any change in export or import regulations or related legislation shift in approach to the enforcement or scope of existing regulations or change in the countries persons or technologies targeted by such regulations could result in decreased use of our products by or in our decreased ability to export or sell our products to existing or potential customers with international operations for example we will need to comply with waste electrical and electronic equipment directive laws which are being adopted by certain european economic area countries on a countrybycountry basis failure to comply with these and similar laws on a timely basis or at all could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition any decreased use of our products or limitation on our ability to export or sell our products would likely adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

 

we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property and our products may infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties 

 

we rely on a combination of patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure of confidential and proprietary information to protect our intellectual property rights despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology monitoring unauthorized use of our products is difficult and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of our technology particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 

 

our industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the ordinary course of our business we are involved in disputes and licensing discussions with others regarding their claimed proprietary rights and cannot assure you that we will always successfully defend ourselves against such claims we expect that infringement claims may increase as the number of products and competitors in our market increases and overlaps occur also as we have gained greater visibility market exposure and competitive success we face a higher risk of being the subject of intellectual property infringement claims if we are found to infringe the proprietary rights of others or if we otherwise settle such claims we could be compelled to pay damages or royalties and either obtain a license to those intellectual property rights or alter our products so that they no longer infringe upon such proprietary rights any license could be very expensive to obtain or may not be available at all similarly changing our products or processes to avoid infringing upon the rights of others 

may be costly or impractical in addition we have initiated and may in the future initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to determine the scope and validity of our proprietary rights or those of our competitors any of these claims whether claims that we are infringing the proprietary rights of others or vice versa with or without merit may be timeconsuming result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel or require us to cease using infringing technology develop noninfringing technology or enter into royalty or licensing agreements further our license agreements typically require us to indemnify our customers distributors and resellers for infringement actions related to our technology which could cause us to become involved in infringement claims made against our customers distributors or resellers any of the abovedescribed circumstances relating to intellectual property rights disputes could result in our business and results of operations being harmed 

 

many of our products include intellectual property licensed from third parties in the future it may be necessary to renew licenses for third party intellectual property or obtain new licenses for other technology these third party licenses may not be available to us on acceptable terms if at all the inability to obtain certain licenses or litigation regarding the interpretation or enforcement of license rights and related intellectual property issues could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition furthermore we license some third party intellectual property on a nonexclusive basis and this may limit our ability to protect our intellectual property rights in our products 

 

we may not be able to sustain or develop new distribution relationships and a reduction or delay in sales to significant distribution partners could hurt our business 

 

we sell our products and services through multiple distribution channels in the united states and internationally including leading industry distributors valueadded resellers systems integrators service providers and other indirect channel partners we have a limited number of agreements with companies in these channels and we may not be able to increase our number of distribution relationships or maintain our existing relationships recruiting and retaining qualified channel partners and training them in our technologies requires significant time and resources if we are unable to establish or maintain our indirect sales channels our business and results of operations will be harmed in addition two worldwide distributors of our products accounted for 247 of our total net revenue for fiscal year 2010 one worldwide distributor of our products accounted for 154 of our total net revenue for fiscal year 2009 a substantial reduction or delay in sales of our products to these distribution partners if not replaced by sales to other indirect channel partners and distributors could harm our business operating results and financial condition 

 

undetected software or hardware errors may harm our business and results of operations 

 

our products may contain undetected errors or defects when first introduced or as new versions are released we have experienced these errors or defects in the past in connection with new products and product upgrades we expect that these errors or defects will be found from time to time in new or enhanced products after commencement of commercial shipments these problems may cause us to incur significant warranty and repair costs divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts and cause significant customer relations problems we may also be subject to liability claims for damages related to product errors or defects while we carry insurance policies covering this type of liability these policies may not provide sufficient protection should a claim be asserted a material product liability claim may harm our business and results of operations 

 

our products must successfully operate with products from other vendors as a result when problems occur in a network it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem the occurrence of software or hardware problems whether caused by our products or another vendor’s products may result in the delay or loss of market acceptance of our products the occurrence of any of these problems may harm our business and results of operations 

adverse general economic conditions or reduced information technology spending may adversely impact our business 

 

a substantial portion of our business depends on the demand for information technology by large enterprise customers and service providers the overall economic health of our current and prospective customers and the continued growth and evolution of the internet international national regional and local economic conditions such as recessionary economic cycles protracted economic slowdown or further deterioration of the economy could adversely impact demand for our products the purchase of our products is often discretionary and may involve a significant commitment of capital and other resources continued weak economic conditions or a reduction in information technology spending even if economic conditions improve would likely result in longer sales cycles and reduced product sales each of which would adversely impact our business results of operations and financial condition 

 

our investments in auction rate securities are subject to risks that may cause losses and affect the liquidity of these investments 

 

at september 30 2010 the fair value of our aaaa or equivalent rated municipal auction rate securities “ars” was approximately 160 million we may not be able to liquidate these ars and realize their full carrying value unless the issuer calls the security a successful auction occurs a buyer is found outside of the auction process or the security otherwise matures while we do not believe the decline in the carrying values of these municipal ars is permanent if the issuers of these securities are unable to successfully close future auctions and their credit ratings are lowered we may be required to record future impairment charges related to these investments which would harm our results of operations we believe certain of these availableforsale investments may remain illiquid for longer than twelve months and as a result we have classified these investments as longterm as of september 30 2010 

 

our operating results are exposed to risks associated with international commerce 

 

as our international sales increase our operating results become more exposed to international operating risks these risks include risks related to recessionary economic cycles or protracted slowdowns in economies outside the united states foreign currency exchange rates managing foreign sales offices regulatory political or economic conditions in specific countries military conflict or terrorist activities changes in laws and tariffs inadequate protection of intellectual property rights in foreign countries foreign regulatory requirements and natural disasters all of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business we intend to continue expanding into international markets international sales represented 414 and 447 of our net revenues for the fiscal years ended september 30 2010 and 2009 respectively 

 

changes in governmental regulations could negatively affect our revenues 

 

our products are subject to various regulations promulgated by the united states and various foreign governments including but not limited to environmental regulations and regulations implementing export license requirements and restrictions on the import or export of some technologies especially encryption technology changes in governmental regulation and our inability or failure to obtain required approvals permits or registrations could harm our international and domestic sales and adversely affect our revenues business and operations 

 

changes in financial accounting standards may cause adverse unexpected revenue fluctuations and affect our reported results of operations 

 

a change in accounting policies can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective new pronouncements and varying interpretations of existing pronouncements have occurred with frequency and may occur in the future changes to existing rules or changes to the interpretations of existing rules could lead to changes in our accounting practices and such changes could adversely affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business 

acquisitions present many risks and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that are contemplated at the time of the transaction 

 

with respect to our past acquisitions as well as any other future acquisitions we may undertake we may find that the acquired businesses products or technologies do not further our business strategy as expected that we paid more than what the assets are later worth or that economic conditions change all of which may generate future impairment charges our acquisitions may be viewed negatively by customers financial markets or investors there may be difficulty integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired business and we may have difficulty retaining the key personnel of the acquired business we may have difficulty in integrating the acquired technologies or products with our existing product lines our ongoing business and management’s attention may be disrupted or diverted by transition or integration issues and the complexity of managing geographically and culturally diverse locations we may have difficulty maintaining uniform standards controls procedures and policies across locations we may experience significant problems or liabilities associated with product quality technology and other matters 

 

our inability to successfully operate and integrate newlyacquired businesses appropriately effectively and in a timely manner or to retain key personnel of any acquired business could have a material adverse effect on our ability to take advantage of further growth in demand for integrated traffic management and security solutions and other advances in technology as well as on our revenues gross margins and expenses 

 

our success depends on our key personnel and our ability to attract and retain qualified sales and marketing operations product development and professional services personnel 

 

our success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our key management product development sales marketing and finance personnel many of whom may be difficult to replace the complexity of our application delivery networking products and their integration into existing networks and ongoing support as well as the sophistication of our sales and marketing effort requires us to retain highly trained professional services customer support and sales personnel competition for qualified professional services customer support and sales personnel in our industry is intense because of the limited number of people available with the necessary technical skills and understanding of our products our ability to retain and hire these personnel may be adversely affected by volatility or reductions in the price of our common stock since these employees are generally granted restricted stock units the loss of services of any of our key personnel the inability to retain and attract qualified personnel in the future or delays in hiring qualified personnel may harm our business and results of operations 

 

we face litigation risks 

 

we are a party to lawsuits in the normal course of our business litigation in general and intellectual property and securities litigation in particular can be expensive lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations moreover the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict responding to lawsuits has been and will likely continue to be expensive and timeconsuming for us an unfavorable resolution of these lawsuits could adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

 

our historical stock option practices and the restatement of our prior financial statements have exposed us to greater risks associated with litigation beginning in may 2006 several derivative actions were filed against certain current and former directors and officers as discussed further in part ii item 8 note 8 “commitments and contingencies — litigation” based on allegations relating to our historical stock option practices we cannot assure you that this current litigation will result in the same conclusions reached by the special committee of outside directors formed by our board of directors to conduct a review of our stock option practices the “special committee” furthermore if we are subject to adverse findings in any of these matters we could be required to pay damages or penalties or have other remedies imposed upon us which could adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

antitakeover provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us 

 

our board of directors has the authority to issue up to 10000000 shares of preferred stock and to determine the price rights preferences privileges and restrictions including voting rights of those shares without any further vote or action by the shareholders the rights of the holders of common stock may be subject to and may be adversely affected by the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future the issuance of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a change of control of our company without further action by our shareholders and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of the holders of common stock further certain provisions of our bylaws including a provision limiting the ability of shareholders to raise matters at a meeting of shareholders without giving advance notice may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or management of our company which could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock in addition our articles of incorporation provide for a staggered board which may make it more difficult for a third party to gain control of our board of directors similarly state antitakeover laws in the state of washington related to corporate takeovers may prevent or delay a change of control of our company

we are not aware of any additional pending legal proceedings that individually or in the aggregate would have a material adverse effect on our business operating results or financial condition we may in the future be party to litigation arising in the ordinary course of business including claims that we allegedly infringe upon thirdparty intellectual property rights such claims even if not meritorious could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources

our management team monitors and analyzes a number of key performance indicators in order to manage our business and evaluate our financial and operating performance those indicators include 

 

 31 

  

  

critical accounting policies 

 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

 

we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements 

 

revenue recognition we sell products through distributors resellers and directly to end users we recognize product revenue upon shipment net of estimated returns provided that collection is determined to be reasonably assured and no significant performance obligations remain in certain regions where we do not have the ability to reasonably estimate returns we defer revenue on sales to our distributors until they have received information from the channel partner indicating that the distributor has sold the product to its customer payment terms to domestic customers are generally net 30 days to net 45 days payment terms to international customers range from net 30 days to net 120 days based on normal and customary trade practices 

in the individual markets we offer extended payment terms to certain customers in which case revenue is recognized when payments are due 

 

whenever product training services and postcontract customer support “pcs” elements are sold together a portion of the sales price is allocated to each element based on their respective fair values as determined when the individual elements are sold separately where fair value of certain elements is not available we recognize revenue on the “residual method” based on the fair value of undelivered elements revenues from the sale of product are recognized when the product has been shipped and the customer is obligated to pay for the product when rights of return are present and we cannot estimate returns we recognize revenue when such rights of return lapse revenues for pcs are recognized on a straightline basis over the service contract term pcs includes a limited period of telephone support updates repair or replacement of any failed product or component that fails during the term of the agreement bug fixes and rights to upgrades when and if available consulting services are customarily billed at fixed hourly rates plus outofpocket expenses and revenues are recognized when the consulting has been completed training revenue is recognized when the training has been completed 

 

fasb asc topic 98560525 software revenue recognition multipleelement arrangements  “asc 98560525” as amended requires revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements to be allocated to each element based on the relative fair values of those elements the fair value of an element must be based on vendor specific objective evidence “vsoe” we establish vsoe for our products training services pcs and consulting services based on the sales price charged for each element when sold separately the sales price is discounted from the applicable list price based on various factors including the type of customer volume of sales geographic region and program level our list prices are generally not fair value as discounts may be given based on the factors enumerated above we believe that the fair value of our consulting services is represented by the billable consulting rate per hour based on the rates we charge customers when they purchase standalone consulting services the price of consulting services is not based on the type of customer volume of sales geographic region or program level 

 

we use historical sales transactions to determine whether vsoe can be established for each of the elements in most instances vsoe of fair value is the sales price of actual standalone unbundled transactions within the past 12 month period that are priced within a reasonable range which we have determined to be plus or minus 15 of the median sales price of each respective price list 

 

vsoe of pcs is based on standalone sales since we do not provide stated renewal rates to our customers in accordance with our pcs pricing practice supported by standalone renewal sales renewal contracts are priced as a percentage of the undiscounted product list price the pcs renewal percentages may vary depending on the type and length of pcs purchased we offer standard and premium pcs and the term generally ranges from one to three years we employ a bellshapedcurve approach in evaluating vsoe of fair value of pcs under this approach we consider vsoe of the fair value of pcs to exist when a substantial majority of our standalone pcs sales fall within a narrow range of pricing 

 

we have established and regularly validate the vsoe of fair value for elements in our multiple element arrangements we account for taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities on a net basis and excluded from revenues 

 

reserve for doubtful accounts estimates are used in determining our allowance for doubtful accounts and are based upon an assessment of selected accounts and as a percentage of our remaining accounts receivable by aging category in determining these percentages we evaluate historical writeoffs current trends in the credit quality of our customer base as well as changes in the credit policies we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition and do not require any collateral if there is deterioration of a major customer’s credit worthiness or actual defaults are higher than our historical experience our allowance for doubtful accounts may not be sufficient 

 

reserve for product returns in some instances product revenue from distributors is subject to agreements allowing rights of return product returns are estimated based on historical experience and are recorded at the time revenues are recognized accordingly we reduce recognized revenue for estimated future 

returns at the time revenue is recorded when rights of return are present and we cannot estimate returns revenue is recognized when such rights lapse the estimates for returns are adjusted periodically based upon changes in historical rates of returns and other related factors it is possible that these estimates will change in the future or that the actual amounts could vary from our estimates 

 

accounting for income taxes we utilize the liability method of accounting for income taxes accordingly we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure including assessing the risks associated with tax audits together with assessing temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities due to the evolving nature and complexity of tax rules combined with the large number of jurisdictions in which we operate it is possible that our estimates of our tax liability could change in the future which may result in additional tax liabilities and adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

 

stockbased compensation we account for stockbased compensation using the straightline attribution method for recognizing compensation expense over the requisite service period of the related award we recognized 708 million and 561 million of stockbased compensation expense for the years ended september 30 2010 and 2009 respectively as of september 30 2010 there was 984 million of total unrecognized stockbased compensation cost the majority of which will be recognized over the next two years going forward stockbased compensation expenses may increase as we issue additional equitybased awards to continue to attract and retain key employees 

 

we issue incentive awards to our employees through stockbased compensation consisting of restricted stock units “rsus” the value of rsus is determined using the fair value method which in this case is based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock on the date of grant no stock options were granted in fiscal years 2010 2009 and 2008 

 

we recognize compensation expense for only the portion of rsus that are expected to vest therefore we apply estimated forfeiture rates that are derived from historical employee termination behavior based on historical differences with forfeitures of stockbased awards granted to our executive officers and board of directors versus grants awarded to all other employees we developed separate forfeiture expectations for these two groups in fiscal year 2010 the estimated forfeiture rate for grants awarded to our executive officers and board of directors was approximately 3 and the estimated forfeiture rate for grants awarded to all other employees was approximately 10 if the actual number of forfeitures differs from those estimated by management additional adjustments to stockbased compensation expense may be required in future periods 

 

we recognize compensation costs for awards with performance conditions when we conclude it is probable that the performance condition will be achieved we reassess the probability of vesting at each balance sheet date and adjust compensation costs based on our probability assessment 

 

common stock repurchase on october 22 2008 we announced that our board of directors approved a program to repurchase up to an additional 200 million of our outstanding common stock on october 26 2010 we announced that our board of directors approved a new program to repurchase up to an additional 200 million of our outstanding common stock as of november 18 2010 we had repurchased and retired 4605827 shares at an average price of 3715 per share 

 

goodwill and intangible assets we have goodwill and intangible assets on our balance sheet related to acquisitions intangible assets are carried and reported at acquisition cost net of accumulated amortization subsequent to acquisition intangible assets are amortized over the estimated useful lives which generally range from three to five years intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate impairment might exist projected undiscounted net cash flows expected to be derived from the use of those assets are compared to the respective net carrying amounts to determine whether any impairment exists impairment if any is based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets 

 

the determination of the net carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets and the extent to which if any there is impairment are dependent on material estimates and judgments on our part including the useful 

life over which the intangible assets are to be amortized and the estimates of the value of future net cash flows which are based upon further estimates of future revenues expenses and operating margins we review our goodwill annually for impairment in the second fiscal quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable the first step of the test identifies whether potential impairment may have occurred while the second step of the test measures the amount of the impairment if any impairment is recognized when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its fair value in march 2010 we completed our annual impairment test and concluded that there was no impairment of goodwill we have considered the assumptions used in the test and noted that no reasonably possible changes would reduce the fair value of the reporting unit to such a level that would cause an impairment charge additionally we considered potential impairment indicators at september 30 2010 and noted no indicators of impairment 

 

investments our investments are diversified among highcredit quality debt securities in accordance with our investment policy we classify our investments as availableforsale which are reported at fair market value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss in stockholders’ equity realized gains and losses and declines in value of these investments judged to be other than temporary are included in other income expense to date we have not deemed it necessary to record any charges related to otherthantemporary declines in the estimated fair values of our marketable debt securities however the fair value of our investments is subject to volatility declines in the fair value of our investments judged to be other than temporary could adversely affect our future operating results 

 

our investments also include auction rate securities “ars” that are classified as availableforsale ars are reported at fair market value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss in stockholders’ equity we believe these investments may remain illiquid for longer than twelve months and as a result we have classified these investments as longterm as of september 30 2010 we used the income approach to determine the fair value of our ars using a discounted cash flow analysis the assumptions we used in preparing the discounted cash flow model include estimates for interest rates estimates for discount rates using yields of comparable traded instruments adjusted for illiquidity and other risk factors amount of cash flows and expected holding periods for the ars 

 

results of operations 

 

the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

 

 

 

net revenues total net revenues increased 350 in fiscal year 2010 from the prior year compared to only a slight increase in fiscal year 2009 from fiscal year 2008 overall revenue growth for the year ended september 30 2010 was primarily due to increased product and service revenues as a result of our increased installed base of products and increased demand for our core adn products including application security and wan optimization products international revenues represented 414 447 and 425 of net revenues in fiscal years 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively we expect international sales will continue to represent a 

significant portion of net revenues although we cannot provide assurance that international revenues as a percentage of net revenues will remain at current levels

net service revenues increased 301 in fiscal year 2010 from fiscal year 2009 and increased 250 in fiscal year 2009 as compared to fiscal year 2008 the increases in service revenue were the result of increased purchases or renewals of maintenance contracts driven by additions to our installed base of products

development expenses remained relatively consistent with the prior year as compared to a year over year increase of 498 in fiscal year 2008 the increase in research and development expense for fiscal year 2008 was primarily due to increased personnel costs of 197 million which is consistent with the increased revenue for the corresponding period research and development headcount at the end of fiscal 2010 increased to 509 from 430 at the end of fiscal 2009 and 460 at the end of fiscal 2008 research and development expense included stockbased compensation charges of 194 million 167 million and 163 million for fiscal years 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively we expect research and development expenses to remain consistent as a percentage of net revenue in the foreseeable future

loss on facility exit and sublease during 2008 we exited a research and development facility in bellevue washington for which there was remaining operating lease obligations through 2014 in addition during this period we consolidated our corporate headquarters partially subleasing the building located at 333 elliott avenue west in seattle washington for which there were remaining operating lease obligations through 2018 as a result of the expected loss on the facility exit and sublease agreements we recorded a charge of 53 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 

 

restructuring beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2009 we implemented a comprehensive restructuring program as part of an overall initiative to reduce certain operating expenses restructuring actions included the consolidation of facilities accelerated depreciation on tenant improvements and a reduction in workforce in the second quarter of fiscal 2009 we recorded restructuring expenses of 43 million which included a 21 million charge for severance and related costs and a 22 million charge for the exit of certain offices worldwide all accrued restructuring costs had been incurred as of september 30 2010 

 

 

other income net other income net consists primarily of interest income and foreign currency transaction gains and losses other income net decreased 216 in fiscal year 2010 as compared to fiscal year 2009 and decreased 487 in fiscal year 2009 as compared to fiscal year 2008 interest income was 81 million 99 million and 175 million for fiscal years 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively the decrease in other income net for fiscal year 2010 as compared to fiscal year 2009 was primarily due to decreased interest income of 18 million partially offset by increased foreign currency transaction gains of 10 million the decrease in interest income for fiscal year 2010 was primarily due to a decline in interest rates for the year the decrease in other income net for fiscal year 2009 as compared to fiscal year 2008 was primarily due to a decline in interest rates for the year which decreased interest income by 76 million and decreased foreign currency transaction gains of 15 million 

 

provision for income taxes we recorded a 364 provision for income taxes for fiscal year 2010 compared to 305 in fiscal year 2009 and 371 in fiscal year 2008 the increase in the effective tax rate from fiscal year 2009 to fiscal year 2010 is largely attributable to the expiration of the federal research and development credit at december 31 2009 and a favorable adjustment related to equity awards in a major foreign tax jurisdiction which was reflected in the effective tax rate for fiscal year 2009 

 

at september 30 2010 we did not have a valuation allowance on any of our deferred tax assets in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate because we believe that the assets are more likely than not to be realized in making this determination we have considered projected future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the appropriateness of a valuation allowance our net deferred tax assets as of fiscal year end 2010 2009 and 2008 were 466 million 570 million and 528 million respectively our worldwide effective tax rate may fluctuate based on a number of factors including variations in projected taxable income in our various geographic locations in which we operate changes in the valuation of our net deferred tax assets resolution of potential exposures tax positions taken on tax returns filed in the various geographic locations in which we operate and the introduction of new accounting standards or changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof in the various geographic locations in which we operate the federal credit for increasing research activities expired at december 31 2009 if the credit is reinstated in fiscal year 2011 the reinstatement may have a material impact on our worldwide effective tax rate for fiscal year 2011 we have recorded liabilities to address potential tax exposures related to business and income tax positions we have taken that could be challenged by taxing authorities the ultimate resolution of these potential exposures may be greater or less than the liabilities recorded which could result in an adjustment to our future tax expense 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

we have funded our operations with our cash balances cash generated from operations and proceeds from public offerings of our securities 

 

 

 

cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and longterm investments totaled 8621 million as of september 30 2010 compared to 5744 million as of september 30 2009 representing an increase of 2876 million the increase was primarily due to cash provided by operating activities of 3136 million for fiscal year 2010 compared to 2020 million for fiscal year 2009 which was partially offset by 750 million of additional cash required for the repurchase of outstanding common stock under our share repurchase program in fiscal 2010 in fiscal year 2009 the increase over the previous year was primarily due to cash provided by operating activities of 2020 million compared to 1937 million for fiscal year 2008 which was 

partially offset by 874 million of additional cash required for the repurchase of outstanding common stock under our share repurchase program in fiscal 2009 

 

at september 30 2010 we held 160 million in fair value of taxexempt ars which are variablerate debt securities and have a longterm maturity with the interest rates being reset through dutch auctions that are typically held every 7 28 or 35 days the securities have historically traded at par and are callable at par at the option of the issuer interest is typically paid at the end of each auction period or semiannually we limit our investments in ars to securities that carry a aaaa or equivalent rating from recognized rating agencies and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer at the time of initial investment and at the date of this annual report on form 10k all of our ars were in compliance with our investment policy 

 

beginning in february 2008 auctions failed for approximately 534 million in par value of municipal ars we held because sell orders exceeded buy orders when these auctions failed to clear higher interest rates for those securities went into effect however the funds associated with these failed auctions will not be accessible until the issuer calls the security a successful auction occurs a buyer is found outside of the auction process or the security matures 

 

we have no reason to believe that any of the underlying issuers of our ars are presently at risk of default the underlying assets of the municipal ars we hold including the securities for which auctions have failed are generally student loans which are guaranteed by the us government through september 30 2010 we have continued to receive interest payments on the ars in accordance with their terms we believe we will be able to liquidate our investments without significant loss primarily due to the government guarantee of the underlying securities however due to uncertainty in the ars market we believe certain of these availableforsale investments may remain illiquid for longer than twelve months and as a result we have classified 190 million par value of our ars as longterm as of september 30 2010 

 

in october 2008 we entered into an agreement “the agreement” with ubs whereby ubs would purchase eligible ars it sold to us prior to february 13 2008 under the terms of the agreement and at our discretion ubs will purchase eligible ars from us at par value “put option” during the period of june 30 2010 through july 2 2012 prior to september 30 2010 ubs purchased all of the eligible ars we held for their par value of 344 million 

 

cash provided by operating activities during fiscal year 2010 was 3136 million compared to 2020 million in fiscal year 2009 and 1937 million in fiscal year 2008 cash provided by operating activities resulted primarily from cash generated from net income after adjusting for noncash charges such as stockbased compensation depreciation and amortization charges and changes in operating assets and liabilities 

 

cash used in investing activities was 2382 million for fiscal year 2010 compared to cash used in investing activities of 991 million for fiscal year 2009 and cash provided by investing activities of 137 million for fiscal year 2008 the cash used in investing activities in fiscal year 2010 was primarily the result of the purchase of investments and capital expenditures related to maintaining our operations worldwide partially offset by the sale and maturity of investments the cash used in investing activities in fiscal year 2009 was primarily the result of the purchase of investments and capital expenditures related to maintaining our operations worldwide partially offset by the sale and maturity of investments the cash provided by investing activities in fiscal year 2008 was primarily the result of the sale and maturity of investments partially offset by the purchase of investments 

 

cash used in financing activities was 168 million for fiscal year 2010 compared to cash used in financing activities of 707 million for fiscal year 2009 and cash used in financing activities of 1817 million for fiscal year 2008 cash used in financing activities for fiscal 2010 included 750 million to repurchase common stock under our share repurchase program which was partially offset by cash received from the exercise of employee stock options and stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan of 317 million and tax benefits related to sharebased compensation of 265 million cash used in financing activities for fiscal 2009 included 874 million to repurchase common stock under our share repurchase program which was partially offset by the exercise of employee stock options and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan cash used in financing activities for fiscal 2008 included 200 million to 

repurchase common stock under a previous share repurchase program which was partially offset by the exercise of employee stock options and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan 

 

based on our current operating and capital expenditure forecasts we believe that our existing cash and investment balances excluding ars together with cash generated from operations should be sufficient to meet our operating requirements for the foreseeable future our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our rate of revenue growth the expansion of our sales and marketing activities the timing and extent of expansion into new territories the timing of introductions of new products and enhancements of existing products and the continuing market acceptance of our products 

 

obligations and commitments 

 

the following table summarizes our contractual payment obligations and commitments as of september 30 2010

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk tableend  

interest rate risk our cash equivalents consist of highquality securities as specified in our investment policy guidelines the policy limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue or issuer to a maximum of 5 of the total portfolio with the exception of us treasury securities commercial paper and money market funds which are exempt from size limitation the policy requires investments in securities that mature in three years or less with the average maturity being no greater than one and a half years these securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if interest rates increase a decrease of one percent in the average interest rate would have resulted in a decrease of approximately 48 million in our interest income for the fiscal year 2010 

 

 

 

 

at september 30 2010 the fair value of our aaaa or equivalent rated municipal ars was approximately 160 million ars are collateralized longterm debt instruments that provide liquidity through a dutch auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at predetermined intervals typically every 7 28 or 35 days beginning in february 2008 auctions failed for approximately 534 million in par value of municipal ars we held because sell orders exceeded buy orders when these auctions failed to clear higher interest rates for those securities went into effect however the funds associated with these failed auctions will not be accessible until the issuer calls the security a successful auction occurs a buyer is found outside of the auction process or the security matures the underlying assets of the municipal ars we hold including the securities for which auctions have failed are generally student loans which are guaranteed by the us government based on our expected operating cash flows and our other sources of cash we do not believe that any reduction in liquidity of our municipal ars will have a material impact on our overall ability to meet our 

liquidity needs we have no intent to sell won’t be required to sell and believe we will hold these securities until recovery we believe certain of these availableforsale investments may remain illiquid for longer than twelve months and as a result we have classified 190 million par value of securities as longterm as of september 30 2010 

 

foreign currency risk the majority of our sales and expenses are denominated in us dollars and as a result we have not experienced significant foreign currency transaction gains and losses to date while we have conducted some transactions in foreign currencies during the fiscal year ended september 30 2010 and expect to continue to do so we do not anticipate that foreign currency transaction gains or losses will be significant at our current level of operations however as we continue to expand our operations internationally transaction gains or losses may become significant in the future we have not engaged in foreign currency hedging to date however we may do so in the future

our management with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief accounting officer evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of september 30 2010 and based on this evaluation our chief executive officer and chief accounting officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of september 30 2010 

 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

 

management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in exchange act rules 13a15f and 15d15f internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 

 

internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override because of such limitations there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting however these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process therefore it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce though not eliminate this risk 

 

management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of september 30 2010 in making this assessment management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission in internal control — integrated framework  based on the results of this assessment and on those criteria management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of september 30 2010 

 

pricewaterhousecoopers llp an independent registered public accounting firm has audited the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k and as part of their audit has issued its attestation report included herein on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting

general 

 

f5 networks is a leading provider of technology that optimizes the delivery of networkbased applications and the security performance and availability of servers data storage devices and other network resources 

 

founded in 1996 f5 pioneered loadbalancing technology that distributes internet traffic evenly across multiple web servers making them look like a single server today our bigip application delivery controllers sit in front of web and application servers balancing traffic and performing computeintensive functions such as encrypting and unencrypting transmissions screening traffic for security threats maintaining open connections with servers speeding the flow of traffic and a variety of other functions that improve the performance availability and security of applications and would otherwise be performed by the servers themselves by offloading functions from servers bigip makes servers more efficient and reduces the number of servers needed to run specific applications bigip also supports software modules that manage the flow of traffic between multiple data centers and across multiple service provider connections ensuring that this traffic is always routed to the most available resource in addition we offer complementary products that provide secure remote access to corporate networks and optimize the delivery of applications over widearea networks 

 

the core of our application delivery controllers and related products is our fullproxy traffic management operating system tmos that enables these products to inspect and modify traffic flows to and from servers at network speed and supports a broad array of functions that enhance the speed performance and availability 

of applications irules a scripting language based on tcl tool command language is a unique feature of tmos that enables customers and third parties to write customized rules to inspect and modify traffic tmos also supports a common software interface called icontrol which enables our products to communicate with one another and with thirdparty products including custom and commercial enterprise applications tmos is designed to support the addition of new functionality as software modules and to exploit the performanceenhancing features of our purposebuilt hardware platforms correspondingly our hardware architecture integrates industry standard components with the unique features and characteristics of tmos to deliver performance that is we believe demonstrably superior to competing products 

 

just as our application delivery controllers make many servers look like one arx storage virtualization products sit in front of network attached storage nas making multiple storage devices from different vendors look like a single device to the individual clients servers and applications that use them this frees users and storage administrators from the timeconsuming task of mapping individual drives to specific clients and applications in addition arx products simplify the migration of data between storage devices the addition of new storage devices and the distribution of data across tiers of storage that reflect the relative importance or immediacy of the data 

 

in connection with our products we offer a broad range of services including consulting training installation maintenance and other technical support services 

 

f5 networks was incorporated on february 26 1996 in the state of washington our headquarters is in seattle washington and our mailing address is 401 elliott avenue west seattle washington 98119 the telephone number at our executive offices is 206 2725555 we have subsidiaries or branch offices in australia france germany hong kong india israel italy japan netherlands new zealand northern ireland russia singapore south korea spain taiwan and the united kingdom our annual reports on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and all amendments to those reports are available free of charge on our website wwwf5com as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with the securities and exchange commission 

 

industry background 

 

growth of ip networks 

 

internet protocol ip is a communications language used to transmit data over the internet since the late 1990s businesses have responded to the power flexibility and efficiency of the internet by deploying new ipbased applications upgrading their clientserver applications to new ipenabled versions and enabling existing or legacy applications for use over the internet at the same time organizations have become more geographically dispersed and increasingly mobile workforces depend on access to corporate applications and data from remote locations and a variety of client devices such as cellular telephones personal digital assistants and notebook computers 

 

over the next several years we believe these trends will accelerate as more organizations discover the benefits of ipenabled applications in addition we believe the growth of internet usage will continue to be driven by new applications such as web services and voice over ip the growth of mobile and broadband internet access and new usage and infrastructure models such as “cloud computing” 

 

in conjunction with the growth of internet traffic the proliferation of data and in particular unstructured data such as voice video images email spreadsheets and formatted text files presents an enormous and increasing challenge to it organizations along with the growing volume of unstructured data that is businesscritical and must be retained and readily accessible to individuals and applications new regulations mandate that company email web pages and other files must be retained indefinitely in response to this challenge it organizations spend an increasing amount of their budget on nas and other types of storage systems 

 

trend toward virtualization 

 

from a broad perspective the goal of it organizations is to optimize the secure delivery of applications and data to users wherever they are and whenever they need them to achieve this goal organizations are 

embracing virtualization technologies that enable them to group or partition data center resources to meet user demand and reconfigure these virtual resources easily and quickly as demand changes server virtualization which allows organizations to improve utilization of physical servers by partitioning them into multiple virtual servers is well known and widely deployed application delivery controllers free up both physical and virtual server processing power by offloading common functions such as encryption and compression from multiple physical or virtual servers and dynamically manage the flow of traffic between users and both virtual and physical servers making them look like a single resource to the user server virtualization puts additional pressure on storage resources by increasing the demand for storage capacity and the complexity of storing and retrieving files sitting in front of storage systems file virtualization devices perform functions similar to application delivery controllers presenting the appearance of a single resource to users and applications and dynamically managing the transfer of files between users applications and multiple storage devices

internet traffic passing between client devices and servers is divided into discrete packets which travel by multiple routes to their destination where they are reassembled the disassembly routing and reassembly of transmissions are relatively straightforward and require little intelligence by contrast application delivery networking — managing inspecting modifying redirecting and securing application traffic going to and from servers — requires intelligent systems capable of performing a broad array of functions 

 

basic application delivery networking adn functions include loadbalancing distributing traffic across multiple servers while making them appear to be a single server and healthchecking monitoring the performance of servers and applications to ensure that they are working properly before routing traffic to them in addition adn encompasses a growing number of functions that have typically been performed by the server or the application itself or by point solutions running on separate devices these include 

 

  

since most large enterprises have hundreds — if not thousands — of servers and applications it is not practical to replicate these functions on each server or build them into the applications themselves even if it 

were maintenance costs would be prohibitive and the net result would be a negative impact on the overall performance of servers and applications deploying point solutions in the network eliminates those problems but creates a new set of challenges using point solutions from multiple vendors can create interoperability issues and problems that do occur can be difficult to troubleshoot from a security standpoint it is also much more difficult to audit traffic passing through multiple devices as a result enterprise customers are increasingly demanding products that integrate adn functions on a single platform 

 

file virtualization 

 

along with other types of ip traffic the volume of filebased information created and accessed by internet users and network applications is growing rapidly according to some estimates the volume of unstructured files is expected to triple annually over the next several years the challenge of storing and managing unstructured files is becoming increasingly costly and complex and reducing the cost and complexity is quickly moving up the list of data center priorities 

 

in many large organizations whose employees are geographically dispersed unstructured data is stored on local file servers which are difficult to manage costly to maintain and generally underutilized information on these devices is easy for local users to access but often inaccessible to others in the organization to reduce the cost complexity and redundancy of dispersed file systems many it organizations are consolidating file storage on centralized nas devices and other types of storage systems migrating and consolidating files is difficult and timeconsuming however and centralized storage systems pose a different set of problems 

 

centralized storage of files can slow access for remote users and applications spurring interest in technology that can speed the transfer of files across wide area networks wans in addition only users and applications that are physically mapped to a specific drive can store and access data on that drive as the drive fills up files must be moved manually to a new drive and affected users and applications must be remapped to that drive in large organizations this often constitutes a roundtheclock chore for many highlyskilled employees 

 

another major storage problem stems from the fact that all files are not created equal many businesses and other organizations have policies or other obligations to retain email and other files increasing the volume of data to archive and in some cases to keep indefinitely since it is unlikely that these files will be accessed frequently if at all in the course of normal business it makes little sense to store them on expensive highperformance systems designed to provide immediate access to businesscritical information as a result it organizations are beginning to deploy tiers of storage systems that match cost capacity and performance to the type of information being stored how frequently it is accessed and its relative importance to the business often the most costeffective solution is a combination of storage systems from different vendors an approach that typically entails migrating huge amounts of data between incompatible devices once that is completed organizations face the challenge of automating the tiering process and the management of aging files 

 

whether or not they deploy tiered file systems many organizations are beginning to address the mounting cost in time and resources of backing up data stored on employee desktops local file servers and other devices according to some estimates approximately 80 of the files organizations back up have not changed since the previous backup worse yet a large and growing percentage are music and video files family photographs and other personal files 

 

responding to increasing demand from it organizations a number of storage vendors and a handful of other companies offer solutions that address some or all of these issues and can be loosely grouped under the heading of file virtualization collectively these solutions encompass a variety of technological approaches designed to optimize and simplify the storage of unstructured data 

 

f5 solutions 

 

application delivery networking 

 

f5 is a leading provider of application delivery networking products that ensure the security optimization and availability of applications for any user anywhere we believe our products offer the most intelligent 

architecture and advanced functionality in the marketplace along with performance flexibility and usability features that help organizations improve the way they serve their employees customers and partners while lowering operational costs 

 

software based products from inception we have been committed to the belief that the complexity of applicationlevel processing requires the flexibility of a softwarebased solution we believe our modular software architecture enables us to deliver the broadest range of integrated functionality in the market and facilitates the addition and integration of new functionality we also believe that integrating our software with commodity hardware components enables us to build products that deliver superior performance functionality and flexibility at competitive prices 

 

full proxy architecture the core of our software technology is the traffic management operating system tmos introduced in september 2004 we believe tmos is a major enhancement of our previous technology that enables our products to deliver functionality that is superior on many levels to any other application delivery networking product in the market with tmos our products can inspect modify and direct both inbound and outbound traffic flows across multiple packets this ability to manage application traffic to and from servers adds value to applications that pass through our devices in ways that are not possible with other application delivery networking solutions in april 2009 we introduced a major upgrade version 100 of tmos that includes more than 130 new features more than 90 applicationready solution templates and a number of performance enhancements all designed to leverage the advanced features and performance of our recently upgraded family of bigip hardware platforms 

 

modular functionality in addition to its full proxy architecture tmos is specifically designed to facilitate the development and integration of application delivery networking functions as modules that can be added to bigip’s core functionality to keep pace with rapidly evolving customer needs feature modules that are available as add ons to tmos version 100 include advanced client authentication advanced routing fast cache intelligent compression ipv6 gateway l7 rate shaping message security module protocol security module and ssl acceleration product modules that are available as add ons include application security manager asm global traffic manager gtm link controller and webaccelerator 

 

application awareness the open architecture of tmos includes an application programming interface api called icontrol that allows our products to communicate with one another and with thirdparty software and devices through this unique feature third party applications and network devices can take an active role in shaping ip network traffic directing traffic based on exact business requirements defined by our customers and solutions partners and tailored to specific applications this “application awareness” capability is a key feature of our softwarebased products and further differentiates our solutions from those of our competitors 

 

applicationspecific configurations developed and tested in collaboration with our solutions partners application ready solutions are configurations designed to optimize bigip deployments for specific applications such as those provided by oracle microsoft siebel and sap as well as generic applications delivered via http with tmos version 100 we introduced templates that reduce the time and effort necessary to configure bigip for a specific application the configuration created is optimal for bigip devices and the specific application for which the template was created and can be further customized for the specific conditions of an organization’s unique infrastructure and environment like other configuration details of bigip devices these templates can easily be shared across multiple bigip deployments 

 

adaptive intelligence the fullproxy capabilities of tmos enable it to inspect or “read” the entire contents of a transmission across multiple packets and identify specific elements of that transmission including items such as names dates and any type of number or label by taking advantage of our unique scripting capability based on tool command language tcl customers can use those elements as variables to create irules that modify the content and direct the flow of traffic in ways tailored to the dynamic needs of their applications irules is a unique feature of tmos that gives our products flexibility we believe to be unmatched by competing products 

 

integrated application layer solutions the combination of our full proxy architecture and enhanced irules enables bigip to intercept inspect and act on the contents of traffic from virtually every type of 

ipenabled application in addition the modularity of the tmos architecture allows us to deliver tightly integrated solutions that secure optimize and ensure the availability of applications and the networks they run on

we believe our future success depends on our ability to maintain technology leadership by continuing to improve our products and by developing new products to meet the changing needs of our customers our product development group employs a standard process for the development documentation and quality control of software and systems that is designed to meet these goals this process includes working with our business development and marketing teams product managers customers and partners to identify new or improved solutions that meet the evolving needs of our addressable markets 

 

our principal software engineering group is located in our headquarters in seattle washington our core product development teams for firepass wanjet and webaccelerator are located in san jose california our core application security manager asm product development team is located in tel aviv israel our arx product development team is located in lowell massachusetts our hardware engineering group is located in spokane washington in addition we maintain a dedicated facility for product testing and quality control in tomsk russia members of all these teams collaborate closely with one another to ensure the interoperability and performance of our hardware and software systems 

 

during the fiscal years ended september 30 2009 2008 and 2007 we had research and product development expenses of 1037 million 1034 million and 690 million respectively 

 

customers 

 

our customers include a wide variety of enterprise customers and service providers among fortune 1000 and business week global 1000 companies including those in technology telecommunications financial services transportation education manufacturing and healthcare along with government customers in fiscal year 2009 international sales represented 447 of our net revenues refer to note 12 of our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding our revenues by geographic area 

 

sales and marketing 

 

sales 

 

we sell our products and services to large enterprise customers and service providers through a variety of channels including distributors valueadded resellers “vars” and systems integrators a substantial amount of our revenue for fiscal year 2009 was derived from these channel sales our sales teams work closely with our channel partners and also sell our products and services directly to a limited number of major accounts 

 

f5 sales teams our inside sales team generates and qualifies leads for regional sales managers and helps manage accounts by serving as a liaison between the field and internal corporate resources our field sales personnel are located in major cities in four sales regions the americas primarily the united states europe the middle east and africa emea japan and the asia pacific region apac field sales personnel work closely with our channel partners to assist them as necessary in the sale of our products and services to their customers we also sell our products and services directly to a limited group of customers 

primarily large enterprises whose accounts are managed by our major account services team field systems engineers support our regional sales managers and channel partners by participating in joint sales calls and providing presale technical resources as needed 

 

distributors and vars consistent with our goal of building a strong channel sales model we have established relationships with a number of large national and international distributors local and specialized distributors and vars we derive a majority of our product sales from these distributors and vars 

 

our agreements with these channel partners are not exclusive and do not prevent them from selling competitive products these agreements typically have terms of one year with no obligation to renew and typically do not provide for exclusive sales territories or minimum purchase requirements 

 

for fiscal year 2009 sales to one of our distributors avnet technologies represented 154 of our total revenues our agreement with this distributor is a standard nonexclusive distribution agreement that renews automatically on an annual basis and can be terminated by either party with 30 days prior written notice the agreement grants avnet technologies the right to distribute our products to resellers in north america and certain other territories internationally with no minimum purchase requirements 

 

systems integrators we also market our products through strategic relationships with systems integrators who include our products as core components of application or networkbased solutions they deploy for their customers in most cases systems integrators do not directly purchase our products for resale to their customers instead they typically recommend our products as part of broader solutions such as enterprise resource planning erp or customer relationship management crm solutions that incorporate our products for high availability and enhanced performance 

 

marketing 

 

our marketing strategy is driven by the belief that our continued success depends on our ability to understand and anticipate the dynamic needs of our addressable markets and to develop valuable solutions that meet those needs in line with this belief our marketing organization works directly with customers partners and our product development teams to identify and create innovative solutions to further enhance our leadership position in addition our business development team which is a component of our marketing organization closely monitors technology companies in adjacent and complementary markets for opportunities to acquire or partner with those whose solutions are complementary to ours and could enable us to expand our addressable market 

 

another key component of our marketing strategy is to develop and expand our icontrol partnerships working closely with our partners we have developed solution sets called application ready solutions that help ensure the successful deployment and delivery of their applications over the network the result of methodical testing and research these solutions have been integrated into tmos version 100 as templates that allow customers to configure our products quickly and easily to optimize the performance of specific applications from major software vendors such as microsoft oracle and sap 

 

to support the growing number of developers using our products including network and application architects we continue to promote and expand devcentral our online community website that provides technical resources to customers prospects and partners wanting to extend and optimize f5 solutions using irules a key aspect of devcentral is an online forum where developers as well as application and network architects discuss and share solutions they have written with irules at the end of fiscal 2009 devcentral had more than 50000 registered members 

 

we also engage in a number of marketing programs and initiatives aimed at promoting our brand and creating market awareness of our technology and products these include actively participating in industry trade shows and joint marketing events with channel and technology partners and briefing industry analysts and members of the trade press on our latest products business relationships and technology partnerships in addition we market our products to chief information officers and other information technology professionals through targeted advertising direct mail and highprofile web events 

backlog 

 

at the end of fiscal years 2009 and 2008 we had product backlog of approximately 355 million and 109 million respectively backlog represents orders confirmed with a purchase order for products to be shipped generally within 90 days to customers with approved credit status orders are subject to cancellation rescheduling by customers or product specification changes by customers although we believe that the backlog orders are firm purchase orders may be cancelled by the customer prior to shipment without significant penalty for this reason we believe that our product backlog at any given date is not a reliable indicator of future revenues 

 

customer service and technical support 

 

we believe that our ability to provide consistent highquality customer service and technical support is a key factor in attracting and retaining large enterprise customers accordingly we offer a broad range of support services that include installation phone support hardware repair and replacement software updates consulting and training services we deliver these services directly to end users and also utilize a multitiered support model leveraging the capabilities of our channel partners when applicable our technical support staff is strategically located in regional service centers to support our global customer base 

 

prior to the installation of our products our services personnel work with customers to analyze their network needs and determine the best way to deploy our products and configure product features and functions to meet those needs our services personnel also provide onsite installation and training services to help customers make optimal use of product features and functions 

 

our customers typically purchase a oneyear maintenance contract which entitles them to an array of services provided by our technical support team maintenance services provided under the contract include online updates software error correction releases hardware repair and replacement and in the majority of cases roundtheclock call center support updates to our software are only available to customers with a current maintenance contract our technical support team also offers seminars and training classes for customers on the configuration and use of products including local and wide area network system administration and management in addition we have a professional services team able to provide a full range of feebased consulting services including comprehensive network management documentation and performance analysis and capacity planning to assist in predicting future network requirements 

 

we also offer as part of our maintenance service an online automated selfhelp customer support function called “ask f5” that allows customers to answer many commonly asked questions without having to call our support desk this allows the customer to rapidly address issues and questions while significantly reducing the number of calls to our support desk this enables us to provide comprehensive customer support while keeping our supportrelated expenses at a manageable consistent level 

 

manufacturing 

 

we outsource the manufacturing of our preconfigured hardware platforms to third party contract manufacturers for assembly according to our specifications 

 

we outsource the majority of our manufacturing to tier 1 electronic manufacturing services providers flextronics manufactures our adc product line and sanminasci manufacturers our arx product line the subcontracting activity at flextronics and sanminasci encompasses prototype builds full production and direct fulfillment our contract manufacturers perform the following activities on our behalf material procurement pcb assembly and test final assembly system test quality control direct shipment and warranty repairs we provide a rolling forecast that allows our contract manufacturers to stock component parts and other materials plan capacity and build finished goods inventory in anticipation of end user demand each of the contract manufacturers procures components necessary to assemble the products in our forecast and tests the products according to our specifications products are then shipped to our distributors valueadded resellers or end users generally we do not own the components title to the products transfers from the contract manufacturers to us and then to our customers upon delivery at a designated shipment location if the components are unused or the products are not sold within specified periods of time we may incur carrying 

charges or obsolete material charges for components that our contract manufacturers purchased to build products to meet our forecast or customer orders 

 

hardware platforms for our products consist primarily of commodity parts and certain custom components designed and approved by our hardware engineering group most of our components are purchased from sources which we believe are readily available from other suppliers however several components used in the assembly of our products are purchased from a single or limited source 

 

competition 

 

the expanding capabilities of our product offerings have enabled us to address a growing array of opportunities many of which are outside the bounds of the traditional layer 47 market within what gartner group has defined as the application acceleration market we compete in the application delivery controller adc market which encompasses the traditional layer 47 market and to a lesser extent the wan optimization controller woc market over the next several years we believe these two markets will merge as wan optimization effectively becomes a feature of application delivery today we offer webaccelerator as a software module on bigip and features of wanjet our wan optimization and trafficshaping device have been integrated into version 100 of tmos 

 

in 2009 approximately 90 of our products and services were sold into the adc market where our primary competitor is cisco systems inc other competitors in this market include citrix systems inc brocade radware ltd and a number of smaller competitors including a10 networks array networks barracuda networks crescendo networks and zeus technology ltd in the adjacent wan optimization controller market we compete with riverbed juniper blue coat systems cisco and citrix currently we do not compete in the branch office segment of the woc market which features products offered by riverbed technology inc bluecoat systems inc cisco and others 

 

file virtualization remains an earlystage market the growth of which has been slowed by the recent global economic downturn we believe our arx file virtualization products are unique in terms of technology and functionality and are well positioned within this emerging market however large storage vendors such as emc corporation offer competing products with overlapping functionality 

 

the principal competitive factors in the markets in which we compete include product performance and features customer support brand recognition the scope of distribution and sales channels and pricing many of our competitors have a longer operating history and greater financial technical marketing and other resources than we do these larger competitors also have a more extensive customer base and broader customer relationships including relationships with many of our current and potential customers in addition many have large wellestablished worldwide customer support and professional services organizations and more extensive direct sales force and sales channels because of our relatively smaller size market presence and resources our larger competitors may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements these companies may also adopt aggressive pricing policies to gain market share as a result our competitors could undermine our ability to win new customers and maintain our existing customer base 

 

intellectual property 

 

we rely on a combination of patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights we have obtained 47 patents in the united states and have applications pending for various aspects of our technology our future success depends in part on our ability to protect our proprietary rights to the technologies used in our principal products despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use trade secrets or other information that we regard as proprietary in addition the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights as fully as do the laws of the united states any issued patent may not preserve our proprietary position and competitors or others may develop technologies similar to or superior to our technology our failure to enforce and protect our intellectual property rights could harm our business operating results and financial condition 

in addition to our own proprietary software we incorporate software licensed from several thirdparty sources into our products these licenses generally renew automatically on an annual basis we believe that alternative technologies for these licenses are available both domestically and internationally 

 

employees 

 

as of september 30 2009 we had 1646 fulltime employees including 430 in product development 696 in sales and marketing 330 in professional services and technical support and 190 in finance administration and operations none of our employees are represented by a labor union we have experienced no work stoppages and believe that our employee relations are good

 item 1a   risk factors tableend  

in addition to the other information in this report the following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating our company and its business 

 

our success depends on our timely development of new products and features market acceptance of new product offerings and proper management of the timing of the life cycle of our products 

 

the application delivery networking and file virtualization markets are characterized by rapid technological change frequent new product introductions changes in customer requirements and evolving industry standards our continued success depends on our ability to identify and develop new products and new features for our existing products to meet the demands of these changes and the acceptance of those products and features by our existing and target customers if we are unable to identify develop and deploy new products and new product features on a timely basis our business and results of operations may be harmed 

 

the current life cycle of our products is typically 12 to 24 months the introduction of new products or product enhancements may shorten the life cycle of our existing products or replace sales of some of our current products thereby offsetting the benefit of even a successful product introduction and may cause customers to defer purchasing our existing products in anticipation of the new products this could harm our operating results by decreasing sales increasing our inventory levels of older products and exposing us to greater risk of product obsolescence we have also experienced and may in the future experience delays in developing and releasing new products and product enhancements this has led to and may in the future lead to delayed sales increased expenses and lower quarterly revenue than anticipated also in the development of our products we have experienced delays in the prototyping of our products which in turn has led to delays in product introductions in addition complexity and difficulties in managing product transitions at the endoflife stage of a product can create excess inventory of components associated with the outgoing product 

that can lead to increased expenses any or all of the above problems could materially harm our business and results of operations 

 

our success depends on sales and continued innovation of our application delivery networking product lines 

 

for the fiscal year ended september 30 2009 we derived approximately 937 of our net product revenues or approximately 583 of our total net revenues from sales of our application delivery networking “adn” product lines we expect to continue to derive a significant portion of our net revenues from sales of our adn products in the future implementation of our strategy depends upon these products being able to solve critical network availability and performance problems of our customers if our adn products are unable to solve these problems for our customers or if we are unable to sustain the high levels of innovation in our adn product feature set needed to maintain leadership in what will continue to be a competitive market environment our business and results of operations will be harmed 

 

we may not be able to compete effectively in the emerging application delivery networking and file virtualization markets 

 

the markets we serve are new rapidly evolving and highly competitive and we expect competition to persist and intensify in the future our principal competitors in the application delivery networking market include cisco citrix brocade and radware in the adjacent wan optimization controller market we compete with riverbed juniper blue coat systems cisco and citrix in the file virtualization market we compete with emc we expect to continue to face additional competition as new participants enter our markets as we continue to expand globally we may see new competitors in different geographic regions in addition larger companies with significant resources brand recognition and sales channels may form alliances with or acquire competing application delivery networking solutions from other companies and emerge as significant competitors potential competitors may bundle their products or incorporate an internet traffic management or security component into existing products in a manner that discourages users from purchasing our products any of these circumstances may limit our opportunities for growth and negatively impact our financial performance 

 

our quarterly and annual operating results are inherently unpredictable and may cause our stock price to fluctuate 

 

our quarterly and annual operating results have varied significantly in the past and will vary significantly in the future which makes it difficult for us to predict our future operating results in particular we anticipate that the size of customer orders may increase as we continue to focus on larger business accounts a delay in the recognition of revenue even from just one account may have a significant negative impact on our results of operations for a given period in the past a majority of our sales have been realized near the end of a quarter accordingly a delay in an anticipated sale past the end of a particular quarter may negatively impact our results of operations for that quarter or in some cases that fiscal year additionally we have exposure to the credit risks of some of our customers and subtenants although we have programs in place that are designed to monitor and mitigate the associated risk there can be no assurance that such programs will be effective in reducing our credit risks adequately we monitor individual payment capability in granting credit arrangements seek to limit the total credit to amounts we believe our customers can pay and maintain reserves we believe are adequate to cover exposure for potential losses if there is a deterioration of a subtenant’s or a major customer’s creditworthiness or actual defaults are higher than expected future losses if incurred could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

 

further our operating results may be below the expectations of securities analysts and investors in future quarters or years our failure to meet these expectations will likely harm the market price of our common stock such a decline could occur and has occurred in the past even when we have met our publicly stated revenue andor earnings guidance 

the average selling price of our products may decrease and our costs may increase which may negatively impact gross profits 

 

it is possible that the average selling prices of our products will decrease in the future in response to competitive pricing pressures increased sales discounts new product introductions by us or our competitors or other factors therefore in order to maintain our gross profits we must develop and introduce new products and product enhancements on a timely basis and continually reduce our product costs our failure to do so will cause our net revenue and gross profits to decline which will harm our business and results of operations in addition we may experience substantial periodtoperiod fluctuations in future operating results due to the erosion of our average selling prices 

 

it is difficult to predict our future operating results because we have an unpredictable sales cycle 

 

our products have a lengthy sales cycle and the timing of our revenue is difficult to predict historically our sales cycle has ranged from approximately two to three months and has tended to lengthen as we have increasingly focused our sales efforts on the enterprise market also as our distribution strategy has evolved into more of a channel model utilizing valueadded resellers distributors and systems integrators the level of variability in the length of sales cycle across transactions has increased and made it more difficult to predict the timing of many of our sales transactions sales of our products require us to educate potential customers in their use and benefits sales of our products are subject to delays from the lengthy internal budgeting approval and competitive evaluation processes that large corporations and governmental entities may require for example customers frequently begin by evaluating our products on a limited basis and devote time and resources to testing our products before they decide whether or not to purchase customers may also defer orders as a result of anticipated releases of new products or enhancements by our competitors or us as a result our products have an unpredictable sales cycle that contributes to the uncertainty of our future operating results 

 

our business may be harmed if our contract manufacturers are not able to provide us with adequate supplies of our products or if a single source of hardware assembly is lost or impaired 

 

we outsource the manufacturing of our hardware platforms to third party contract manufacturers who assemble these hardware platforms to our specifications we have experienced minor delays in shipments from contract manufacturers in the past however if we experience major delays in the future or other problems such as inferior quality and insufficient quantity of product any one or a combination of these factors may harm our business and results of operations the inability of our contract manufacturers to provide us with adequate supplies of our products or the loss of one or more of our contract manufacturers may cause a delay in our ability to fulfill orders while we obtain a replacement manufacturer and may harm our business and results of operations in particular we currently subcontract manufacturing of our application delivery networking products to a single contract manufacturer with whom we do not have a longterm contract if our arrangement with this single source of hardware assembly was terminated or otherwise impaired and we were not able to engage another contract manufacturer in a timely manner our business financial condition and results of operation could be adversely affected 

 

if the demand for our products grows we will need to increase our raw material and component purchases contract manufacturing capacity and internal test and quality control functions any disruptions in product flow may limit our revenue may harm our competitive position and may result in additional costs or cancellation of orders by our customers 

 

our business could suffer if there are any interruptions or delays in the supply of hardware components from our thirdparty sources 

 

we currently purchase several hardware components used in the assembly of our products from a number of single or limited sources lead times for these components vary significantly the unavailability of suitable components any interruption or delay in the supply of any of these hardware components or the inability to procure a similar component from alternate sources at acceptable prices within a reasonable time may delay 

assembly and sales of our products and hence our revenues and may harm our business and results of operations 

 

we are subject to governmental export and import controls that could subject us to liability or impair our ability to compete in international markets 

 

our products are subject to us export controls and may be exported outside the us only with the required level of export license or through an export license exception because we incorporate encryption technology into our products in addition various countries regulate the import of certain encryption technology and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute our products or our customers’ ability to implement our products in those countries changes in our products or changes in export and import regulations may create delays in the introduction of our products in international markets prevent our customers with international operations from deploying our products throughout their global systems or in some cases prevent the export or import of our products to certain countries altogether any change in export or import regulations or related legislation shift in approach to the enforcement or scope of existing regulations or change in the countries persons or technologies targeted by such regulations could result in decreased use of our products by or in our decreased ability to export or sell our products to existing or potential customers with international operations for example we will need to comply with waste electrical and electronic equipment directive laws which are being adopted by certain european economic area countries on a countrybycountry basis failure to comply with these and similar laws on a timely basis or at all could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition any decreased use of our products or limitation on our ability to export or sell our products would likely adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

 

we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property and our products may infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties 

 

we rely on a combination of patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure of confidential and proprietary information to protect our intellectual property rights despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology monitoring unauthorized use of our products is difficult and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of our technology particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 

 

our industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the ordinary course of our business we are involved in disputes and licensing discussions with others regarding their claimed proprietary rights and cannot assure you that we will always successfully defend ourselves against such claims if we are found to infringe the proprietary rights of others or if we otherwise settle such claims we could be compelled to pay damages or royalties and either obtain a license to those intellectual property rights or alter our products so that they no longer infringe upon such proprietary rights any license could be very expensive to obtain or may not be available at all similarly changing our products or processes to avoid infringing upon the rights of others may be costly or impractical in addition we have initiated and may in the future initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to determine the scope and validity of our proprietary rights or those of our competitors any of these claims whether claims that we are infringing the proprietary rights of others or vice versa with or without merit may be timeconsuming result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel or require us to cease using infringing technology develop noninfringing technology or enter into royalty or licensing agreements further our license agreements typically require us to indemnify our customers distributors and resellers for infringement actions related to our technology which could cause us to become involved in infringement claims made against our customers distributors or resellers any of the abovedescribed circumstances relating to intellectual property rights disputes could result in our business and results of operations being harmed 

 

many of our products include intellectual property licensed from third parties in the future it may be necessary to renew licenses for third party intellectual property or obtain new licenses for other technology 

these third party licenses may not be available to us on acceptable terms if at all the inability to obtain certain licenses or litigation regarding the interpretation or enforcement of license rights and related intellectual property issues could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition furthermore we license some third party intellectual property on a nonexclusive basis and this may limit our ability to protect our intellectual property rights in our products 

 

we may not be able to sustain or develop new distribution relationships and a reduction or delay in sales to significant distribution partners could hurt our business 

 

we sell our products and services through multiple distribution channels in the united states and internationally including leading industry distributors valueadded resellers systems integrators and other indirect channel partners we have a limited number of agreements with companies in these channels and we may not be able to increase our number of distribution relationships or maintain our existing relationships recruiting and retaining qualified channel partners and training them in our technologies requires significant time and resources if we are unable to establish or maintain our indirect sales channels our business and results of operations will be harmed in addition one worldwide distributor of our products accounted for 154 of our total net revenue for fiscal year 2009 two worldwide distributors of our products together accounted for 245 of our total net revenue for fiscal year 2008 a substantial reduction or delay in sales of our products to these distribution partners if not replaced by sales to other indirect channel partners and distributors could harm our business operating results and financial condition 

 

undetected software or hardware errors may harm our business and results of operations 

 

our products may contain undetected errors or defects when first introduced or as new versions are released we have experienced these errors or defects in the past in connection with new products and product upgrades we expect that these errors or defects will be found from time to time in new or enhanced products after commencement of commercial shipments these problems may cause us to incur significant warranty and repair costs divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts and cause significant customer relations problems we may also be subject to liability claims for damages related to product errors or defects while we carry insurance policies covering this type of liability these policies may not provide sufficient protection should a claim be asserted a material product liability claim may harm our business and results of operations 

 

our products must successfully operate with products from other vendors as a result when problems occur in a network it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem the occurrence of software or hardware problems whether caused by our products or another vendor’s products may result in the delay or loss of market acceptance of our products the occurrence of any of these problems may harm our business and results of operations 

 

adverse general economic conditions or reduced information technology spending may adversely impact our business 

 

a substantial portion of our business depends on the demand for information technology by large enterprise customers and service providers the overall economic health of our current and prospective customers and the continued growth and evolution of the internet national regional and local economic conditions such as recessionary economic cycles protracted economic slowdown or further deterioration of the economy could adversely impact demand for our products the purchase of our products is often discretionary and may involve a significant commitment of capital and other resources continued weak economic conditions or a reduction in information technology spending even if economic conditions improve would likely result in longer sales cycles and reduced product sales each of which would adversely impact our business results of operations and financial condition 

our investments in auction rate securities are subject to risks that may cause losses and affect the liquidity of these investments 

 

at september 30 2009 the fair value of our aaaa or equivalent rated municipal auction rate securities “ars” was approximately 401 million beginning in february 2008 auctions failed for approximately 534 million in par value of municipal ars we held because sell orders exceeded buy orders we may not be able to liquidate these investments and realize their full carrying value unless the issuer calls the security a successful auction occurs a buyer is found outside of the auction process or the security matures while we do not believe the decline in the carrying values of these municipal ars is permanent if the issuers of these securities are unable to successfully close future auctions and their credit ratings are lowered we may be required to record future impairment charges related to these investments which would harm our results of operations we believe certain of these availableforsale investments may remain illiquid for longer than twelve months and as a result we have classified these investments as longterm as of september 30 2009 

 

our operating results are exposed to risks associated with international commerce 

 

as our international sales increase our operating results become more exposed to international operating risks these risks include risks related to recessionary economic cycles or protracted slowdowns in economies outside the united states foreign currency exchange rates managing foreign sales offices regulatory political or economic conditions in specific countries military conflict or terrorist activities changes in laws and tariffs inadequate protection of intellectual property rights in foreign countries foreign regulatory requirements and natural disasters all of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business we intend to continue expanding into international markets international sales represented 447 and 425 of our net revenues for the fiscal years ended september 30 2009 and 2008 respectively in particular in fiscal year 2009 we derived 87 of our total revenue from the japanese market this revenue is dependent on a number of factors outside our control including the viability and success of our resellers and the strength of the japanese economy 

 

changes in governmental regulations could negatively affect our revenues 

 

our products are subject to various regulations promulgated by the united states and various foreign governments including but not limited to environmental regulations and regulations implementing export license requirements and restrictions on the import or export of some technologies especially encryption technology changes in governmental regulation and our inability or failure to obtain required approvals permits or registrations could harm our international and domestic sales and adversely affect our revenues business and operations 

 

acquisitions present many risks and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that are contemplated at the time of the transaction 

 

with respect to our past acquisitions as well as any other future acquisitions we may undertake we may find that the acquired businesses products or technologies do not further our business strategy as expected that we paid more than what the assets are later worth or that economic conditions change all of which may generate future impairment charges our acquisitions may be viewed negatively by customers financial markets or investors there may be difficulty integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired business and we may have difficulty retaining the key personnel of the acquired business we may have difficulty in integrating the acquired technologies or products with our existing product lines our ongoing business and management’s attention may be disrupted or diverted by transition or integration issues and the complexity of managing geographically and culturally diverse locations we may have difficulty maintaining uniform standards controls procedures and policies across locations we may experience significant problems or liabilities associated with product quality technology and other matters 

 

our inability to successfully operate and integrate newlyacquired businesses appropriately effectively and in a timely manner or to retain key personnel of any acquired business could have a material adverse 

effect on our ability to take advantage of further growth in demand for integrated traffic management and security solutions and other advances in technology as well as on our revenues gross margins and expenses 

 

our success depends on our key personnel and our ability to attract and retain qualified sales and marketing operations product development and professional services personnel 

 

our success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our key management product development sales marketing and finance personnel many of whom may be difficult to replace the complexity of our application delivery networking products and their integration into existing networks and ongoing support as well as the sophistication of our sales and marketing effort requires us to retain highly trained professional services customer support and sales personnel competition for qualified professional services customer support and sales personnel in our industry is intense because of the limited number of people available with the necessary technical skills and understanding of our products our ability to retain and hire these personnel may be adversely affected by volatility or reductions in the price of our common stock since these employees are generally granted restricted stock units or stock options the loss of services of any of our key personnel the inability to retain and attract qualified personnel in the future or delays in hiring qualified personnel may harm our business and results of operations 

 

we face litigation risks 

 

we are a party to lawsuits in the normal course of our business litigation in general and intellectual property and securities litigation in particular can be expensive lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations moreover the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict responding to lawsuits has been and will likely continue to be expensive and timeconsuming for us an unfavorable resolution of these lawsuits could adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

 

our historical stock option practices and the restatement of our prior financial statements have exposed us to greater risks associated with litigation beginning in may 2006 several derivative actions were filed against certain current and former directors and officers as discussed further in part ii item 8 note 8 “commitments and contingencies — litigation” based on allegations relating to our historical stock option practices we cannot assure you that this current litigation will result in the same conclusions reached by the special committee of outside directors formed by our board of directors to conduct a review of our stock option practices the “special committee” 

 

we may in the future be subject to additional litigation arising in relation to our historical stock option practices and the restatement of our prior financial statements litigation may be time consuming expensive and distracting for management from the conduct of our business the adverse resolution of any lawsuit could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we cannot assure you that any future litigation relating to our historical stock option practices will result in the same conclusions reached by the special committee furthermore if we are subject to adverse findings in any of these matters we could be required to pay damages or penalties or have other remedies imposed upon us which could adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

 

the matters relating to our historical stock option practices and the restatement of our consolidated financial statements have resulted in regulatory proceedings against us and may result in future regulatory proceedings which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition 

 

on november 8 2006 we announced that the special committee had completed its review of our historical stock option practices upon completion of its review the special committee found that the recorded grant dates for certain stock options granted during fiscal years 1999 to 2004 should be adjusted as the measurement date for accounting purposes and the accounting treatment used for the vesting of certain stock options was incorrect based on the special committee’s review to correct the accounting treatment we amended our annual report on form 10ka as amended for the year ended september 30 2005 and our quarterly reports on form 10q for the three months ended december 31 2005 and march 31 2006 to restate the consolidated financial statements contained in those reports 

in may 2006 we received notice from both the securities and exchange commission “sec” and the united states attorney’s office for the eastern district of new york the “department of justice” that they were conducting informal inquiries into our historical stock option practices we have fully cooperated with both agencies considerable legal and accounting expenses related to our historical stock option practices have been incurred and we may in the future be subject to additional regulatory proceedings or actions arising in relation to our historical stock option practices and the restatement of our prior period financial statements any potential regulatory proceeding or action may be time consuming expensive and distracting for management from the conduct of our business the adverse resolution of any potential regulatory proceeding or action could adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition we cannot assure you that the sec and department of justice inquiries or any future regulatory action relating to our historical stock option practices will result in the same conclusions reached by the special committee furthermore if we are subject to adverse findings in any of these matters we could be required to pay damages or penalties or have other remedies imposed upon us including criminal penalties which could adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

 

antitakeover provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us 

 

our board of directors has the authority to issue up to 10000000 shares of preferred stock and to determine the price rights preferences privileges and restrictions including voting rights of those shares without any further vote or action by the shareholders the rights of the holders of common stock may be subject to and may be adversely affected by the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future the issuance of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a change of control of our company without further action by our shareholders and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of the holders of common stock further certain provisions of our bylaws including a provision limiting the ability of stockholders to raise matters at a meeting of shareholders without giving advance notice may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or management of our company which could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock in addition our articles of incorporation provide for a staggered board which may make it more difficult for a third party to gain control of our board of directors similarly state antitakeover laws in the state of washington related to corporate takeovers may prevent or delay a change of control of our company

critical accounting policies 

 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

 

we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements 

 

revenue recognition we sell products through distributors resellers and directly to end users we recognize product revenue upon shipment net of estimated returns provided that collection is determined to be reasonably assured and no significant obligations remain in certain regions where we do not have the ability to reasonably estimate returns we defer revenue on sales to our distributors until we receive information from the channel partner indicating that the distributor has sold the product to its customer payment terms to domestic customers are generally net 30 days to net 45 days payment terms to international customers range from net 30 days to net 90 days based on normal and customary trade practices in the 

individual markets we have offered extended payment terms ranging from three to six months to certain customers in which case revenue is recognized when payments are made 

 

whenever product training and postcontract customer support “pcs” elements are combined into a package with a single “bundled” price a portion of the sales price is allocated to each element of the bundled package based on their respective fair values as determined when the individual elements are sold separately we determine fair value based on the type of customer and region in which the package is sold where fair value of certain elements are not available we recognize revenue on the “residual method” based on the fair value of undelivered elements revenues from the sale of product are recognized when the product has been shipped and the customer is obligated to pay for the product when rights of return are present and we cannot estimate returns we recognize revenue when such rights of return lapse revenues for pcs are recognized on a straightline basis over the service contract term pcs includes a limited period of telephone support updates repair or replacement of any failed product or component that fails during the term of the agreement bug fixes and rights to upgrades when and if available consulting services are customarily billed at fixed rates plus outofpocket expenses and revenues are recognized when the consulting has been completed training revenue is recognized when the training has been completed 

 

reserve for doubtful accounts estimates are used in determining our allowance for doubtful accounts and are based upon an assessment of selected accounts and as a percentage of our remaining accounts receivable by aging category in determining these percentages we evaluate historical writeoffs current trends in the credit quality of our customer base as well as changes in the credit policies we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition and do not require any collateral if there is deterioration of a major customer’s credit worthiness or actual defaults are higher than our historical experience our allowance for doubtful accounts may not be sufficient 

 

reserve for product returns in some instances product revenue from distributors is subject to agreements allowing rights of return product returns are estimated based on historical experience and are recorded at the time revenues are recognized accordingly we reduce recognized revenue for estimated future returns at the time revenue is recorded when rights of return are present and we cannot estimate returns revenue is recognized when such rights lapse the estimates for returns are adjusted periodically based upon changes in historical rates of returns and other related factors it is possible that these estimates will change in the future or that the actual amounts could vary from our estimates 

 

accounting for income taxes we utilize the liability method of accounting for income taxes accordingly we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure including assessing the risks associated with tax audits together with assessing temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities due to the evolving nature and complexity of tax rules combined with the large number of jurisdictions in which we operate it is possible that our estimates of our tax liability could change in the future which may result in additional tax liabilities and adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

 

stockbased compensation we account for stockbased compensation using the straightline attribution method for recognizing compensation expense over the requisite service period of the related award we recognized 561 million and 606 million of stockbased compensation expense for the years ended september 30 2009 and 2008 respectively as of september 30 2009 there was 825 million of total unrecognized stockbased compensation cost the majority of which will be recognized over the next two years going forward stockbased compensation expenses may increase as we issue additional equitybased awards to continue to attract and retain key employees 

 

we issue incentive awards to our employees through stockbased compensation consisting of stock options and restricted stock units “rsus” the value of rsus is determined using the fair value method which in this case is based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock on the date of grant alternatively in determining the fair value of stock options we use the blackscholes option pricing model that employs the following key assumptions expected volatility is based on the annualized 

daily historical volatility of our stock price over the expected life of the option expected term of the option is based on historical employee stock option exercise behavior the vesting terms of the respective option and a contractual life of ten years our stock price volatility and option lives involve management’s best estimates at that time both of which impact the fair value of the option calculated under the blackscholes methodology and ultimately the expense that will be recognized over the life of the option 

 

we recognize compensation expense for only the portion of stock options or rsus that are expected to vest therefore we apply estimated forfeiture rates that are derived from historical employee termination behavior based on historical differences with forfeitures of stockbased awards granted to our executive officers and board of directors versus grants awarded to all other employees we developed separate forfeiture expectations for these two groups in fiscal 2009 the average estimated forfeiture rate for grants awarded to our executive officers and board of directors was approximately 4 and the average estimated forfeiture rate for grants awarded to all other employees was approximately 11 if the actual number of forfeitures differs from those estimated by management additional adjustments to stockbased compensation expense may be required in future periods 

 

in august 2009 we granted 420000 rsus to certain current executive officers fifty percent of the aggregate number of rsus granted at such time vest in equal quarterly increments over two years until such portion of the grant is fully vested on august 1 2011 twentyfive percent of the rsu grant or a portion thereof is subject to our achievement of specified quarterly revenue and ebitda goals during the period beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009 through the third quarter of fiscal year 2010 fifty percent of the quarterly performance stock grant is based on achieving at least 80 of the quarterly revenue goal and the other 50 is based on achieving at least 80 of the quarterly ebitda goal the “2009 performance award” the quarterly performance stock grant is paid linearly above 80 of the targeted goals at least 100 of both goals must be attained in order for the quarterly performance stock grant to be awarded over 100 each goal is evaluated individually and subject to the 80 achievement threshold and 100 overachievement threshold the remaining twentyfive percent is subject to our achievement of specified quarterly goals during the period beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010 through the third quarter of fiscal year 2011 as will be set by the compensation committee of our board of directors 

 

in august 2008 we granted 383400 rsus to certain current executive officers fifty percent of the aggregate number of rsus granted at such time vest in equal quarterly increments over two years until such portion of the grant is fully vested on august 1 2010 twentyfive percent of the rsu grant or a portion thereof was subject to our achievement of specified percentage increases in total revenue during the period beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008 through the third quarter of fiscal year 2009 relative to the same periods in fiscal years 2007 and 2008 the “2008 performance award” approximately half of this twentyfive percent was earned in fiscal 2009 the remaining twentyfive percent or a portion thereof is subject to our achievement of specified quarterly revenue and ebitda goals during the period beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009 through the third quarter of fiscal year 2010 fifty percent of the quarterly performance stock grant is based on achieving at least 80 of the quarterly revenue goal and the other 50 is based on achieving at least 80 of the quarterly ebitda goal the quarterly performance stock grant is paid linearly above 80 of the targeted goals at least 100 of both goals must be attained in order for the quarterly performance stock grant to be awarded over 100 each goal is evaluated individually and subject to the 80 achievement threshold and 100 overachievement threshold 

 

in august 2007 we granted 276400 rsus to certain current executive officers fifty percent of the aggregate number of rsus granted at such time vest in equal quarterly increments over two years and was fully vested on august 1 2009 twentyfive percent of the rsu grant was subject to our achievement of specified percentage increases in total revenue during the period beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007 through the third quarter of fiscal year 2008 relative to the same periods in fiscal years 2006 and 2007 the “2007 performance award” this twentyfive percent was fully earned in fiscal 2008 the remaining twentyfive percent was subject to our achievement of specified percentage increases in total revenue during the period beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008 through the third quarter of fiscal year 2009 relative to the same periods in fiscal years 2007 and 2008 approximately half of this twentyfive percent was earned in fiscal 2009 

we recognize compensation costs for awards with performance conditions when we conclude it is probable that the performance condition will be achieved we reassess the probability of vesting at each balance sheet date and adjust compensation costs based on our probability assessment performance conditions for these awards were not met in the second and third fiscal quarters of 2009 and as such no compensation cost was incurred 

 

common stock repurchase on october 22 2008 we announced that our board of directors approved a new program to repurchase up to an additional 200 million of our outstanding common stock as of november 18 2009 we had repurchased and retired 3482597 shares at an average price of 2694 per share 

 

goodwill and intangible assets we have a significant amount of goodwill and intangible assets on our balance sheet related to acquisitions intangible assets are carried and reported at acquisition cost net of accumulated amortization subsequent to acquisition intangible assets are amortized over the estimated useful lives which generally range from three to five years intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate impairment might exist projected undiscounted net cash flows expected to be derived from the use of those assets are compared to the respective net carrying amounts to determine whether any impairment exists impairment if any is based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets 

 

the determination of the net carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets and the extent to which if any there is impairment are dependent on material estimates and judgments on our part including the useful life over which the intangible assets are to be amortized and the estimates of the value of future net cash flows which are based upon further estimates of future revenues expenses and operating margins we review our goodwill annually for impairment in the second fiscal quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable the first step of the test identifies whether potential impairment may have occurred while the second step of the test measures the amount of the impairment if any impairment is recognized when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its fair value in march 2009 we completed our annual impairment test and concluded that there was no impairment of goodwill the company has considered the assumptions used in the test and notes that no reasonably possible changes would reduce the fair value of the reporting unit to such a level that would cause an impairment charge additionally as a result of the current economic environment we considered potential impairment indicators at september 30 2009 and noted no indicators of impairment 

 

investments our investments are diversified among highcredit quality debt securities in accordance with our investment policy the majority of our investments are classified as availableforsale and are reported at fair market value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss in stockholders’ equity realized gains and losses and declines in value of these investments judged to be other than temporary are included in other income expense to date we have not deemed it necessary to record any charges related to otherthantemporary declines in the estimated fair values of our marketable debt securities however the fair value of our investments is subject to volatility declines in the fair value of our investments judged to be other than temporary could adversely affect our future operating results 

 

our investments also include auction rate securities “ars” that are classified as availableforsale and as trading investment securities ars that are classified as availableforsale are reported at fair market value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss in stockholders’ equity we believe these investments may remain illiquid for longer than twelve months and as a result we have classified these investments as longterm as of september 30 2009 ars securities classified as trading investment securities are reported at fair value with the related changes in fair value recorded to other income expense these ars have been classified as short term as we have the opportunity to liquidate these securities within the next twelve months through a guaranteed program with our investment manager we used the income approach to determine the fair value of our ars using a discounted cash flow analysis the assumptions we used in preparing the discounted cash flow model include estimates for interest rates estimates for discount rates using yields of comparable traded instruments adjusted for illiquidity and other risk factors amount of cash flows and expected holding periods for the ars 

results of operations 

 

the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

 

 

 

net revenues total net revenues increased slightly in fiscal year 2009 from the prior year compared to an increase of 237 in fiscal year 2008 from fiscal year 2007 given the current economic environment we did not experience the same level of net revenue growth that we have had in prior periods and as a result net revenue for fiscal year 2009 remained relatively flat with fiscal 2008 the change in net revenue was primarily due to a reduction in the volume of product sales offset by an increase in service revenue as a result of our increased installed base of products international revenues represented 447 425 and 416 of net revenues in fiscal years 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively we expect international sales will continue to represent a significant portion of net revenues although we cannot provide assurance that international revenues as a percentage of net revenues will remain at current levels 

 

net product revenues decreased 102 in fiscal year 2009 from fiscal year 2008 and increased 153 in fiscal year 2008 as compared to fiscal year 2007 the decrease of 464 million in net product sales for fiscal year 2009 was primarily due to a 361 million reduction in the volume of sales of our adn products a 54 million reduction in the sales of our arx file virtualization products and a 49 million reduction in the volume of sales of our firepass products as compared to the same period in the prior year sales of our adn products represented 937 920 and 945 of total product revenues in fiscal years 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively 

 

net service revenues increased 250 in fiscal year 2009 from fiscal year 2008 and increased 486 in fiscal year 2008 as compared to fiscal year 2007 the increases in service revenue were the result of increased purchases or renewals of maintenance contracts driven by additions to our installed base of products 

 

avnet technology solutions one of our worldwide distributors accounted for 154 140 and 132 of our total net revenue in fiscal years 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively ingram micro inc another worldwide distributor accounted for 105 and 116 of our total net revenues in fiscal years 2008 and 2007 respectively no other distributors accounted for more than 10 of total net revenue 

 

 

 

cost of net product revenues cost of net product revenues consist of finished products purchased from our contract manufacturers manufacturing overhead freight warranty provisions for excess and obsolete inventory and amortization expenses in connection with developed technology from acquisitions product cost decreased to 952 million in fiscal year 2009 as compared to 1024 million in fiscal year 2008 the year over year decrease was primarily due to a reduction in the volume of units shipped in fiscal year 2008 the year over year increase from 841 million in fiscal year 2007 was primarily due to a higher volume of units shipped the fiscal year 2008 increase also included shipments of our arx file virtualization products and increased indirect manufacturing costs over prior periods 

 

cost of net service revenues cost of net service revenues consist of the salaries and related benefits of our professional services staff travel facilities and depreciation expenses cost of net service revenues as a percentage of net service revenues decreased to 193 in fiscal year 2009 from 236 in fiscal year 2008 and 258 in fiscal year 2007 primarily due to the scalability of our existing customer support infrastructure and increased revenue from maintenance contracts professional services headcount at the end of fiscal year 2009 increased to 330 from 323 at the end of fiscal year 2008 and 279 at the end of fiscal year 2007 in addition cost of net service revenues included stockbased compensation expense of 48 million 40 million and 24 million for fiscal years 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively 

 

 

 

sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses consist of salaries commissions and related benefits of our sales and marketing staff the costs of our marketing programs including public relations advertising and trade shows travel facilities and depreciation expenses sales and marketing expense decreased 51 in fiscal year 2009 as compared to year over year increases of 351 and 377 in fiscal years 2008 and 2007 respectively the decrease in sales and marketing expense was primarily due to cost reduction initiatives we implemented in response to the slowing economic environment and a 69 million decrease in commissions expense corresponding to the decrease in product revenue for fiscal year 2009 compared to the prior year the fiscal year 2008 increase over the prior year was primarily due to a full year of expenses related to our arx file virtualization personnel as compared to the 17 days of comparable expenses in fiscal year 2007 sales and marketing headcount at the end of fiscal 2009 decreased to 696 from 716 at the end of fiscal 2008 and 669 at the end of fiscal 2007 the decrease in headcount was primarily related to a reduction in workforce that took place in the second fiscal quarter of 2009 as part of our restructuring program sales and marketing expense included stockbased compensation charges of 226 million 241 million and 158 million for fiscal years 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively 

 

research and development research and development expenses consist of the salaries and related benefits for our product development personnel prototype materials and other expenses related to the development of new and improved products facilities and depreciation expenses in fiscal year 2009 research and development expenses remained relatively consistent with the prior year as compared to year over year increases of 498 and 404 in fiscal years 2008 and 2007 respectively the increase in research and development expense in fiscal years 2008 and 2007 was primarily due to increased personnel costs which totaled 197 million and 122 million respectively which is consistent with the increased revenue for the corresponding periods the fiscal year 2008 increase over the prior year was also attributed to a full year of expenses related to our arx file virtualization personnel as compared to the 17 days of comparable expenses in fiscal year 2007 research and development headcount at the end of fiscal 2009 decreased to 430 from 460 at the end of fiscal 2008 and 450 at the end of fiscal 2007 the decrease in headcount was primarily related to a reduction in workforce that took place in the second fiscal quarter of 2009 as part of our restructuring program research and development expense included stockbased compensation charges of 167 million 163 million and 102 million for fiscal years 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively we expect research and development expenses to remain consistent as a percentage of net revenue in the foreseeable future 

general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist of the salaries benefits and related costs of our executive finance information technology human resource and legal personnel thirdparty professional service fees bad debt charges facilities and depreciation expenses general and administrative expenses remained relatively consistent in fiscal year 2009 as compared with year over year increases of 137 in fiscal year 2008 and 259 in fiscal year 2007 the increase in fiscal year 2008 of 67 million was due primarily to an increase of 32 million in stockbased compensation charges and an increase of 35 million in salary and benefit expenses general and administrative headcount at the end of fiscal 2009 decreased to 190 from 195 at the end of fiscal 2008 and increased from 184 at the end of fiscal 2007 the decrease in headcount was primarily related to a reduction in workforce that took place in the second fiscal quarter of 2009 as part of our restructuring program general and administrative expense included stockbased compensation charges of 116 million 159 million and 126 million for fiscal years 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively 

 

inprocess research and development acquired inprocess research and development “iprd” expense was 140 million in 2007 and reflects the amount allocated to iprd that we acquired in the acopia networks inc “acopia” acquisition iprd represents the present value of estimated aftertax cash flows expected to be generated by purchased technology which at the acquisition date had not yet reached technological feasibility we based our estimates and projections related to iprd on assumptions we believed to be reasonable at the time of the acquisition but that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable if we do not successfully develop this product our business operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected 

 

loss on facility exit and sublease during 2008 we exited a research and development facility in bellevue washington for which there was remaining operating lease obligations through 2014 in addition during this period we consolidated our corporate headquarters partially subleasing the building located at 333 elliott avenue west in seattle washington for which there were remaining operating lease obligations through 2018 as a result of the expected loss on the facility exit and sublease agreements we recorded a charge of 53 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 

 

restructuring beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2009 we implemented a comprehensive restructuring program as part of an overall initiative to reduce certain operating expenses restructuring actions included the consolidation of facilities accelerated depreciation on tenant improvements and a reduction in workforce in the second quarter of fiscal 2009 we recorded restructuring expenses of 43 million which included a 21 million charge for severance and related costs and a 22 million charge for the exit of certain offices worldwide we had 06 million of accrued restructuring cost at september 30 2009 which we expect to offset future rent expenses through september 2012 

 

 

 

other income net other income net consists of interest income and foreign currency transaction gains and losses other income net decreased 487 in fiscal year 2009 as compared to fiscal year 2008 and decreased 328 in fiscal year 2008 as compared to fiscal year 2007 interest income was 99 million 175 million and 273 million for fiscal years 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively the decrease in other income net for fiscal year 2009 as compared to fiscal year 2008 was primarily due to decreased interest income of 76 million and decreased foreign currency transaction gains of 15 million the decrease in interest income for fiscal year 2009 was primarily due to a decline in interest rates for the year the decrease in other income net for fiscal year 2008 as compared to fiscal year 2007 was primarily due to decreased interest income as a result of reduced investment balances investment balances decreased in fiscal year 2008 as a result of the repurchase of outstanding common stock under our stock repurchase program and additional cash required for the acquisition of acopia in september 2007 

 

provision for income taxes we recorded a 305 provision for income taxes for fiscal year 2009 compared to 371 in fiscal year 2008 and 397 in fiscal year 2007 the reduction in the effective tax rate from fiscal year 2008 to fiscal year 2009 is largely attributable to the deduction for tax purposes of compensation related to equity awards in a major foreign tax jurisdiction the reinstatement of the federal research and development credit in fiscal year 2009 and deductions obtained for us tax purposes relative to the cessation of operations of a foreign subsidiary in the quarter ending september 30 2009 

 

at september 30 2009 we did not have a valuation allowance on any of our deferred tax assets in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate because we believe that the assets are more likely than not to be realized in making this determination we have considered projected future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the appropriateness of a valuation allowance our net deferred tax assets as of fiscal year end 2009 2008 and 2007 were 570 million 528 million and 433 million respectively our worldwide effective tax rate may fluctuate based on a number of factors including variations in projected taxable income in our various geographic locations in which we operate changes in the valuation of our net deferred tax assets resolution of potential exposures tax positions taken on tax returns filed in the various geographic locations in which we operate and the introduction of new accounting standards or changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof in the various geographic locations in which we operate we have recorded liabilities to address potential tax exposures related to business and income tax positions we have taken that could be challenged by taxing authorities the ultimate resolution of these potential exposures may be greater or less than the liabilities recorded which could result in an adjustment to our future tax expense in addition on may 4 2009 us president barack obama proposed significant changes to the us international tax laws that would limit us deductions for expenses related to unrepatriated foreignsource income and modify the 

us foreign tax credit and “checkthebox” rules we cannot determine whether these proposals will be enacted into law or what if any changes may be made to such proposals prior to their being enacted into law if the us tax laws change in a manner that increases our tax obligation our operating results could suffer

cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and longterm investments totaled 5744 million as of september 30 2009 compared to 4513 million as of september 30 2008 representing an increase of 1232 million the increase was primarily due to cash provided by operating activities of 2020 million for fiscal year 2009 compared to 1937 million for fiscal year 2008 which was partially offset by 874 million of additional cash required for the repurchase of outstanding common stock under our stock repurchase program in fiscal 2009 in fiscal year 2008 the decrease was primarily due to approximately 200 million of cash used to repurchase outstanding common stock under our stock repurchase program in fiscal 2008 partially offset by cash provided by operating activities of 1937 million for the year ended september 30 2008 

 

at september 30 2009 we held 401 million of taxexempt ars which are variablerate debt securities and have a longterm maturity with the interest rates being reset through dutch auctions that are typically held every 7 28 or 35 days the securities have historically traded at par and are callable at par at the option of the issuer interest is typically paid at the end of each auction period or semiannually we limit our investments in ars to securities that carry a aaaa or equivalent rating from recognized rating agencies and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer at the time of initial investment and at the date of this annual report on form 10k all of our ars were in compliance with our investment policy 

 

beginning in february 2008 auctions failed for approximately 534 million in par value of municipal ars we held because sell orders exceeded buy orders when these auctions failed to clear higher interest rates for those securities went into effect however the funds associated with these failed auctions will not be accessible until the issuer calls the security a successful auction occurs a buyer is found outside of the auction process or the security matures the underlying assets of the municipal ars we hold including the securities for which auctions have failed are generally student loans which are guaranteed by the us government 

 

we have no reason to believe that any of the underlying issuers of our ars are presently at risk of default through september 30 2009 we have continued to receive interest payments on the ars in accordance with their terms we believe we will be able to liquidate our investments without significant loss primarily due to the government guarantee of the underlying securities however due to recent changes and uncertainty in the ars market we believe certain of these availableforsale investments may remain illiquid for longer than twelve months and as a result we have classified 190 million par value of securities as longterm as of september 30 2009 

 

in october 2008 we entered into an agreement “the agreement” with ubs whereby ubs would purchase eligible ars it sold to us prior to february 13 2008 under the terms of the agreement and at our discretion ubs will purchase eligible ars from us at par value “put option” during the period of june 30 2010 through july 2 2012 amounts eligible total 261 million par value at september 30 2009 we expect to sell our eligible ars under the agreement however if we do not exercise our rights to sell our eligible 

ars under the agreement before july 2 2012 the put option will expire and ubs will have no further rights or obligations to buy our ars so long as we hold our ars they will continue to accrue interest as determined by the auction process or the terms of the ars if the auction process fails in the first quarter of fiscal year 2009 we transferred these ars from availableforsale to trading investment securities we elected to measure the put option under the fair value option and recorded a benefit in other income of approximately 15 million pretax for the year ended september 30 2009 and recorded a corresponding long term investment as a result of accepting the put option and reclassifying the ars from availableforsale to trading investment securities we recognized an otherthantemporary impairment loss of approximately 15 million pretax as of september 30 2009 reflecting a reversal of the related unrealized loss that was previously recorded in other comprehensive loss the recording of the fair value of the put option and the recognition of the otherthantemporary impairment loss resulted in no impact to the consolidated income statement for the year ended september 30 2009 

 

cash provided by operating activities during fiscal year 2009 was 2020 million compared to 1937 million in fiscal year 2008 and 1697 million in fiscal year 2007 cash provided by operating activities resulted primarily from cash generated from net income after adjusting for noncash charges such as stockbased compensation depreciation and amortization charges and changes in operating assets and liabilities 

 

cash used in investing activities was 991 million for fiscal year 2009 compared to cash provided by investing activities of 137 million for fiscal year 2008 and cash used in investing activities of 1881 million for fiscal year 2007 the cash used in investing activities in fiscal year 2009 was primarily the result of the purchase of investments and capital expenditures related to maintaining our operations worldwide partially offset by the maturity of investments the cash provided by investing activities in fiscal year 2008 was primarily the result of the maturity of investments partially offset by the purchase of investments the cash used in fiscal year 2007 was primarily the result of the purchase of investments partially offset by the sale of investments and 2071 million of cash payments net of cash acquired to shareholders of acopia which was acquired in september 2007 

 

cash used in financing activities was 707 million for fiscal year 2009 compared to cash used in financing activities of 1817 million for fiscal year 2008 and cash provided by financing activities of 355 million in fiscal years 2007 in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 our board of directors approved a new stock repurchase program to repurchase up to an additional 200 million of our outstanding common stock cash used in financing activities for fiscal 2009 included 874 million to repurchase common stock under this plan which was partially offset by the exercise of employee stock options and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan cash used in financing activities for fiscal 2008 included 200 million to repurchase common stock under a previous stock repurchase program which was partially offset by the exercise of employee stock options and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan during fiscal year 2007 our financing activities consisted entirely of cash proceeds and tax benefits received from the exercise of stock options and stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan 

 

based on our current operating and capital expenditure forecasts we believe that our existing cash and investment balances excluding ars together with cash generated from operations should be sufficient to meet our operating requirements for the foreseeable future 

 

obligations and commitments 

 

the following table summarizes our contractual payment obligations and commitments as of september 30 2009 

 

 

we lease our facilities under operating leases that expire at various dates through 2018 

 

purchase obligations are comprised of purchase commitments with our contract manufacturers the agreement with our primary contract manufacturer allows them to procure component inventory on our behalf based on our production forecast we are obligated to purchase component inventory that the contract manufacturer procures in accordance with the forecast unless cancellation is given within applicable lead times

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk tableend  

interest rate risk our cash equivalents consist of highquality securities as specified in our investment policy guidelines the policy limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue or issuer to a maximum of 5 of the total portfolio with the exception of us treasury securities commercial paper and money market funds which are exempt from size limitation the policy requires investments in securities that mature in three years or less with the average maturity being no greater than one and a half years these securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if interest rates increase a decrease of one percent in the average interest rate would have resulted in a decrease of approximately 13 million in our interest income for the fiscal year 2009 

 

 

at september 30 2009 the fair value of our aaaa or equivalent rated municipal ars was approximately 401 million ars are collateralized longterm debt instruments that provide liquidity through a dutch auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at predetermined intervals typically every 7 28 or 35 days beginning in february 2008 auctions failed for approximately 534 million in par value of municipal ars we held because sell orders exceeded buy orders when these auctions failed to clear higher interest rates for those securities went into effect however the funds associated with these failed auctions will not be accessible until the issuer calls the security a successful auction occurs a buyer is found outside of the auction process we exercise the put option with ubs or the security matures the underlying assets of the municipal ars we hold including the securities for which auctions have failed are generally student loans which are guaranteed by the us government based on our expected operating cash flows and our other sources of cash we do not believe that any reduction in liquidity of our municipal ars will have a material impact on our overall ability to meet our liquidity needs we have no intent to sell won’t be required to sell and believe we will hold these securities until recovery the trading investment securities of 246 million par value have been classified as shortterm and the availableforsale securities of 155 million par value have been classified as longterm at september 30 2009 

 

foreign currency risk the majority of our sales and expenses are denominated in us dollars and as a result we have not experienced significant foreign currency transaction gains and losses to date while we have conducted some transactions in foreign currencies during the fiscal year ended september 30 2009 and expect to continue to do so we do not anticipate that foreign currency transaction gains or losses will be significant at our current level of operations however as we continue to expand our operations internationally transaction gains or losses may become significant in the future we have not engaged in foreign currency hedging to date however we may do so in the future

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

 

the company maintains disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “exchange act” that are designed to ensure that required information is recorded processed summarized and reported within the required timeframe as specified in the rules set forth by the securities exchange commission our disclosure controls and procedures are also designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated to management including the chief executive officer and chief accounting officer to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures 

 

our management with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief accounting officer evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of september 30 2009 and based on this evaluation our chief executive officer and chief accounting officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of september 30 2009 

 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

 

management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in exchange act rules 13a15f and 15d15f internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 

 

internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override because of such limitations there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting however these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process therefore it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce though not eliminate this risk 

 

management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of september 30 2009 in making this assessment management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission in internal control — integrated framework  based on the results of this assessment and on those criteria management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of september 30 2009 

 

the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of september 30 2009 has been audited by pricewaterhousecoopers llp an independent registered public accounting firm as stated in their report which appears herein 

 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

 

during the fourth fiscal quarter there were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting that materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal controls over financial reporting

general 

 

f5 networks is a leading provider of technology that optimizes the delivery of networkbased applications and the performance and availability of servers data storage devices and other network resources 

 

founded in 1996 f5 pioneered loadbalancing technology that distributes internet traffic evenly across multiple web servers making them look like a single server today our bigip application delivery controllers sit in front of web and application servers balancing traffic and performing computeintensive functions such as encrypting and unencrypting transmissions screening traffic for security threats maintaining open connections with servers speeding the flow of traffic and a variety of other functions that improve the performance availability and security of applications and would otherwise be performed by the servers themselves by offloading functions from servers bigip makes servers more efficient and reduces the number of servers needed to run specific applications bigip also supports software modules that manage the flow of traffic between multiple data centers and across multiple service provider connections ensuring that this traffic is always routed to the most available resource in addition we offer complementary products that provide secure remote access to corporate networks and optimize the delivery of applications over widearea networks 

 

we believe our application delivery controllers and related products are superior to competing technology in both functionality and performance the core of these products is our fullproxy traffic management operating system tmos that enables them to inspect and modify traffic flows to and from servers at 

network speed and supports a broad array of functions that enhance the speed performance and availability of applications irules a scripting language based on tcl tools command language is a unique feature of tmos that enables customers and third parties to write customized rules to inspect and modify traffic tmos also supports a common software interface called icontrol which enables our products to communicate with one another and with thirdparty products including custom and commercial enterprise applications tmos is designed to support the addition of new functionality as software modules and to exploit the performanceenhancing features of our purposebuilt hardware platforms correspondingly our hardware architecture integrates industry standard components in ways that exploit the unique features and characteristics of tmos to deliver performance that is demonstrably superior to competing products 

 

just as our application delivery controllers make many servers look like one arx storage virtualization products sit in front of networked attached storage nas making multiple storage devices from different vendors look like a single device to the individual clients servers and applications that use them this frees users and storage administrators from the timeconsuming task of mapping individual drives to specific clients and applications in addition arx products simplify the migration of data between storage devices the addition of new storage devices and the distribution of data across tiers of storage that reflect the relative importance or immediacy of the data 

 

in connection with our products we offer a broad range of services including consulting training installation maintenance and other technical support services

industry background 

 

growth of ip networks 

 

internet protocol ip is a communications language used to transmit data over the internet since the late 1990s businesses have responded to the power flexibility and efficiency of the internet by deploying new ipbased applications upgrading their clientserver applications to new ipenabled versions and enabling existing or legacy applications for use over the internet at the same time organizations have become more geographically dispersed and increasingly mobile workforces depend on access to corporate applications and data from remote locations and a variety of client devices such as cellular telephones personal digital assistants and notebook computers 

 

over the next several years we believe these trends will accelerate as more organizations discover the benefits of ipenabled applications in addition we believe the growth of internet usage will continue to be driven by new applications such as web services and voice over ip the growth of broadband internet access and new usage and infrastructure models such as “cloud computing” 

 

in conjunction with the growth of internet traffic the proliferation of data and in particular unstructured data such as voice video images email spreadsheets and formatted text files presents an enormous and increasing challenge to it organizations along with the growing volume of unstructured data that is businesscritical and must be retained and readily accessible to individuals and applications new regulations mandate that company email web pages and other files must be retained indefinitely in response to this challenge it organizations spend an increasing amount of their budget on nas and other types of storage systems 

trend toward virtualization 

 

from a broad perspective the goal of it organizations is to optimize the secure delivery of applications and data to users wherever they are and whenever they need them to achieve this goal organizations are embracing virtualization technologies that enable them to group or partition data center resources to meet user demand and reconfigure these virtual resources easily and quickly as demand changes server virtualization which allows organizations to improve utilization of physical servers by partitioning them into multiple virtual servers is well known and widely deployed application delivery controllers free up both physical and virtual server processing power by offloading common functions such as encryption and compression from multiple physical or virtual servers and dynamically manage the flow of traffic between users and both virtual and physical servers making them look like a single resource to the user server virtualization puts additional pressure on storage resources by increasing storage capacity and traffic requirements sitting in front of storage systems file virtualization devices perform functions similar to application delivery controllers presenting the appearance of a single resource to users and applications and dynamically managing the transfer of files between users and applications and multiple storage devices 

 

application delivery networking 

 

internet traffic passing between client devices and servers is divided into discrete packets which travel by multiple routes to their destination where they are reassembled the disassembly routing and reassembly of transmissions are relatively straightforward and require little intelligence by contrast application delivery networking — managing inspecting modifying and redirecting application traffic going to and from servers — requires intelligent systems capable of performing a broad array of functions 

 

basic application delivery networking adn functions include loadbalancing distributing traffic across multiple servers while making them appear to be a single server and healthchecking monitoring the performance of servers and applications to ensure that they are working properly before routing traffic to them in addition adn encompasses a growing number of functions that have typically been performed by the server or the application itself or by point solutions running on separate devices these include

since most large enterprises have hundreds — if not thousands — of servers and applications it is not practical to replicate these functions on each server or build them into the applications themselves even if it were maintenance costs would be prohibitive and the net result would be a negative impact on the overall performance of servers and applications deploying point solutions in the network eliminates those problems but creates a new set of challenges using point solutions from multiple vendors can create interoperability issues and problems that do occur can be difficult to troubleshoot from a security standpoint it is also much more difficult to audit traffic passing through multiple devices as a result enterprise customers are increasingly demanding products that integrate adn functions on a single platform 

 

file virtualization 

 

along with other types of ip traffic the volume of filebased information created and accessed by internet users and network applications is growing rapidly according to some estimates the volume of unstructured files is expected to triple annually over the next several years the challenge of storing and managing unstructured files is becoming increasingly costly and complex and reducing the cost and complexity is quickly moving up the list of data center priorities 

 

in many large organizations whose employees are geographically dispersed unstructured data is stored on local file servers which are difficult to manage costly to maintain and generally underutilized information on these devices is easy for local users to access but often inaccessible to others in the organization to reduce the cost complexity and redundancy of dispersed file systems many it organizations are consolidating file storage on centralized nas devices and other types of storage systems migrating and consolidating files is difficult and timeconsuming however and centralized storage systems pose a different set of problems 

 

centralized storage of files can slow access for remote users and applications spurring interest in technology that can speed the transfer of files across wide area networks wans in addition only users and applications that are physically mapped to a specific drive can store and access data on that drive as the drive fills up files must be moved manually to a new drive and affected users and applications must be remapped to that drive in large organizations this often constitutes a roundtheclock chore for many highlyskilled employees 

 

another major storage problem stems from the fact that all files are not created equal many businesses and other organizations have policies or other obligations to retain email and other files increasing the volume of data to archive and in some cases to keep indefinitely since it is unlikely that these files will be accessed frequently if at all in the course of normal business it makes little sense to store them on expensive highperformance systems designed to provide immediate access to businesscritical information as a result it organizations are beginning to deploy tiers of storage systems that match cost capacity and performance to the type of information being stored how frequently it is accessed and its relative importance to the business often the most costeffective solution is a combination of storage systems from different vendors an approach that typically entails migrating huge amounts of data between incompatible devices once that is completed organizations face the challenge of automating the tiering process and the management of aging files 

 

whether or not they deploy tiered file systems many organizations are beginning to address the mounting cost in time and resources of backing up data stored on employee desktops local file servers and other devices according to some estimates approximately 80 of the files organizations back up have not changed since the previous backup worse yet a large and growing percentage are music and video files family photographs and other personal files 

 

responding to increasing demand from it organizations a number of storage vendors and a handful of other companies offer solutions that address some or all of these issues and can be loosely grouped under the heading of file virtualization collectively these solutions encompass a variety of technological approaches designed to optimize and simplify the storage of unstructured data

we continue to invest in research and development to provide our customers with comprehensive integrated solutions in application delivery networking our product development efforts leverage the unique attributes of our softwarebased platforms to deliver new features and functions that address the complex and changing needs of our customers our acquisition investments in arx are aimed at providing data solutions to the complex challenge of efficiently storing and managing the huge and growing volume of unstructured files created by network users and applications for both our application delivery controllers and file virtualization products development of highperformance proprietary hardware is a key component of our investment strategy in developing these products we will continue to use commodity hardware in order to ensure performance and cost competitiveness 

enhancing channel sales and distribution model 

 

we continue to invest significant resources in developing and expanding our indirect sales and distribution channels by cultivating our relationships with our existing partners and actively developing new relationships our efforts to recruit new partners are aimed primarily at large valueadded resellers systems integrators and industryleading systems manufacturers 

 

continuing to build and expand relationships with strategic technology partners 

 

to compete successfully against cisco and other large competitors who have an established presence in our target accounts we have developed strategic technology partnerships with enterprise software vendors such as microsoft oracle and sap who also have an established presence in those accounts by taking advantage of our open application programming interface called icontrol these vendors can enable their applications to control our products in the network enhancing overall application performance in addition we have worked closely with several of these vendors to develop configurations of our products called application ready networks that are specifically tuned to simplify deployment and optimize the performance of their applications in return these vendors provide us significant leverage in the selling process by recommending our products to their customers we plan to continue building on our existing relationships and to extend our competitive edge by developing new relationships with other strategic partners 

 

leveraging devcentral our online community of network architects and developers 

 

customization of our products using irules enhances their “stickiness” by allowing customers to solve problems in both their applications and their networks that would be difficult if not impossible to solve by other means to promote the use of irules we host an online community where network architects and developers can discuss and share the ways in which they use irules to solve problems and enhance the security performance and availability of applications a corollary benefit is that many of the irules solutions posted by devcentral participants have become standard features in new releases of tmos 

 

enhancing our brand 

 

we plan to continue building awareness of f5 as a leading provider of application delivery networking products that enable agility improve efficiency and optimize the security performance and availability of network applications servers and storage systems our goal is to make the f5 brand synonymous with superior technology high quality customer service trusted advice and definitive business value

enterprise manager 

 

enterprise manager takes advantage of our icontrol interface to provide a single centralized management console for our adn products enterprise manager allows customers with dozens or hundreds of our products to discover and view those products in a single window and to upgrade or modify the software on those products simultaneously this lowers the cost and simplifies the task of deploying managing and maintaining our products and reduces the likelihood of error when blanket changes are implemented 

 

enterprise manager 500 and enterprise manager 3000 are appliancebased devices on dedicated enterprisegrade platforms enterprise manager 500 provides control for up to 50 f5 devices and enterprise manager 3000 provides control for up to 300 f5 devices 

 

arx 

 

the arx product family is a series of high performance enterpriseclass intelligent file virtualization devices that dramatically simplify the management of file storage environments and lower total storage costs by automating data management tasks and eliminating the disruption associated with storage management operations the arx series is powered by the freedomfabric network operating system which automates many storage management tasks that are performed manually today and eliminates the disruption associated with those tasks freedomfabric’s unique suite of storage management policies includes data migration automated storage tiering data replication and dynamic load balancing 

 

currently the arx series includes four products the arx 500 the low end of the series is a standalone device that can manage more than 120 million files the arx 1000 is a standalone device and can manage more than 380 million files in october 2008 we introduced the arx 4000 a fixed formfactor device supporting 10 gigabit ethernet and capable of managing more than 2 billion files the highend arx 6000 is a chassisbased device with multiple blades that can manage more than 2 billion files 

 

additionally in october 2008 we introduced f5 data manager a software product that interfaces directly with most file storage devices including arx file virtualization platforms data manager gathers valuable file storage statistics and provides graphical reporting and trending functions to give users visibility into their constantly changing data storage environments helping them respond to business needs and better plan for future growth 

 

enabling technologies 

 

icontrol is an application programming interface that allows customers and independent software vendors to modify their programs to communicate with our products eliminating the need for human involvement lowering the cost of performing basic network functions and reducing the likelihood of error although we do not derive revenue from icontrol itself the sale of icontrolenabled applications by independent software vendors such as microsoft and oracle helps promote and often leads directly to the sale of our other products 

 

irules is a builtin feature of our tmos architecture that allows customers to manipulate and manage any ip application traffic that passes through our tmosbased products irules has an easytolearn scripting syntax and enables users to customize how they intercept inspect transform and direct inbound or outbound application traffic 

product development 

 

we believe our future success depends on our ability to maintain technology leadership by continuing to improve our products and by developing new products to meet the changing needs of our customers our product development group employs a standard process for the development documentation and quality control of software and systems that is designed to meet these goals this process includes working with management product management customers and partners to identify new or improved solutions that meet the evolving needs of our addressable markets 

 

our principal software engineering group is located in our headquarters in seattle washington our core product development teams for firepass wanjet and webaccelerator are located in san jose california we also have a smaller development facility for wanjet and webaccelerator in belfast northern ireland our core application security manager asm product development team is located in tel aviv israel our arx product development team is located in lowell massachusetts our hardware engineering group is located in spokane washington in addition we maintain a dedicated facility for product testing and quality control in tomsk russia members of all these teams collaborate closely with one another to ensure the interoperability and performance of our hardware and software systems 

 

during the fiscal years ended september 30 2008 2007 and 2006 we had research and product development expenses of 1034 million 690 million and 492 million respectively 

 

customers 

 

our customers include a wide variety of enterprise customers and service providers among fortune 1000 and business week global 1000 companies including those in technology telecommunications financial services transportation and manufacturing industries along with government customers in fiscal year 2008 international sales represented 425 of our net revenues refer to note 10 of our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding our revenues by geographic area 

 

sales and marketing 

 

sales 

 

we sell our products and services to large enterprise customers and service providers through a variety of channels including distributors valueadded resellers “vars” and systems integrators a substantial amount of our revenue for fiscal year 2008 was derived from these channel sales our sales teams work closely with our channel partners and sell our products and services directly to a limited number of major accounts 

 

f5 sales teams our inside sales team generates and qualifies leads for regional sales managers and helps manage accounts by serving as a liaison between the field and internal corporate resources our field sales personnel are located in major cities in four sales regions the americas europe the middle east and africa emea japan and the asia pacific region apac field sales personnel work closely with our channel partners to assist them as necessary in the sale of our products and services to their customers we also sell our products and services directly to a limited group of customers primarily large enterprises whose accounts are managed by our major account services team field systems engineers support our regional sales managers and channel partners by participating in joint sales calls and providing presale technical resources as needed 

 

distributors and vars consistent with our goal of building a strong channel sales model we have established relationships with a number of large national and international distributors local and specialized distributors and vars we derive a majority of our product sales from these distributors and vars 

 

our agreements with these channel partners are not exclusive and do not prevent them from selling competitive products these agreements typically have terms of one year with no obligation to renew and typically do not provide for exclusive sales territories or minimum purchase requirements 

for fiscal year 2008 sales to two of our distributors ingram micro inc and avnet technologies represented 105 and 140 of our total revenues respectively our agreements with these distributors are standard nonexclusive distribution agreements that renew automatically on an annual basis and can be terminated by either party with 30 days prior written notice the agreements grant ingram micro and avnet technologies the right to distribute our products to resellers in north america and certain other territories internationally with no minimum purchase requirements 

 

systems integrators we also market our products through strategic relationships with systems integrators who include our products as core components of application or networkbased solutions they deploy for their customers in most cases systems integrators do not directly purchase our products for resale to their customers instead they typically recommend our products as part of broader solutions such as enterprise resource planning erp or customer relationship management crm solutions that incorporate our products for high availability and enhanced performance 

 

marketing 

 

our marketing strategy is driven by the belief that our continued success depends on our ability to understand and anticipate the dynamic needs of our addressable markets and to develop valuable solutions that meet those needs in line with this belief our marketing organization works directly with customers partners and our product development teams to identify and create innovative solutions to further enhance our leadership position in addition our business development team which is a component of our marketing organization closely monitors technology companies in adjacent and complementary markets for opportunities to acquire or partner with those whose solutions are complementary to ours and could enable us to expand our addressable market 

 

another key component of our marketing strategy is to develop and expand our icontrol partnerships working closely with our partners we have developed solution sets called application ready networks arns that help ensure the successful deployment and delivery of their applications over the network the result of methodical testing and research arns provide architecturebased bestpractice documentation on how to deploy f5 products with applications from major software vendors such as microsoft oracle and sap helping joint customers unlock the full potential of those applications 

 

to support the growing number of developers using our products including network and application architects we continue to promote and expand devcentral our online community website that provides technical resources to customers prospects and partners wanting to extend and optimize f5 solutions using irules a key aspect of devcentral is an online forum where developers as well as application and network architects discuss and share solutions they have written with irules at the end of fiscal 2008 devcentral had more than 32600 registered members 

 

we also engage in a number of marketing programs and initiatives aimed at promoting our brand and creating market awareness of our technology and products these include actively participating in industry trade shows and joint marketing events with channel and technology partners and briefing industry analysts and members of the trade press on our latest products business relationships and technology partnerships in addition we market our products to chief information officers and other information technology professionals through targeted advertising direct mail and highprofile web events 

 

backlog 

 

at the end of fiscal years 2008 and 2007 we had product backlog of approximately 109 million and 99 million respectively backlog represents orders confirmed with a purchase order for products to be shipped generally within 90 days to customers with approved credit status orders are subject to cancellation rescheduling by customers or product specification changes by customers although we believe that the backlog orders are firm purchase orders may be cancelled by the customer prior to shipment without significant penalty for this reason we believe that our product backlog at any given date is not a reliable indicator of future revenues 

customer service and technical support 

 

we believe that our ability to provide consistent highquality customer service and technical support is a key factor in attracting and retaining large enterprise customers accordingly we offer a broad range of support services that include installation phone support hardware repair and replacement software updates consulting and training services we deliver these services directly to end users and also utilize a multitiered support model leveraging the capabilities of our channel partners when applicable our technical support staff is strategically located in regional service centers to support our global customer base 

 

prior to the installation of our products our services personnel work with customers to analyze their network needs and determine the best way to deploy our products and configure product features and functions to meet those needs our services personnel also provide onsite installation and training services to help customers make optimal use of product features and functions 

 

our customers typically purchase a oneyear maintenance contract which entitles them to an array of services provided by our technical support team maintenance services provided under the contract include online updates software error correction releases hardware repair and replacement and remote support through a 24 hours a day 7 days a week help desk although not all service contracts entitle a customer to roundtheclock call center support updates to our software are only available to customers with a current maintenance contract our technical support team also offers seminars and training classes for customers on the configuration and use of products including local and wide area network system administration and management in addition we have a professional services team able to provide a full range of feebased consulting services including comprehensive network management documentation and performance analysis and capacity planning to assist in predicting future network requirements 

 

we also offer as part of our maintenance service an online automated selfhelp customer support function called “ask f5” that allows customers to answer many commonly asked questions without having to call our support desk this allows the customer to rapidly address issues and questions while significantly reducing the number of calls to our support desk this enables us to provide comprehensive customer support while keeping our supportrelated expenses at a manageable consistent level 

 

manufacturing 

 

we outsource the manufacturing of our preconfigured hardware platforms to third party contract manufacturers for assembly according to our specifications 

 

flextronics was our primary third party manufacturer in 2008 flextronics also installs our software onto the hardware platforms and conducts functionality testing quality assurance and documentation control prior to shipping our products our agreement with flextronics allows it to procure component inventory on our behalf based upon a rolling production forecast subcontractors supply flextronics with standard parts and components for our products based on our production forecast we are contractually obligated to purchase component inventory that our contract manufacturer procures in accordance with the forecast unless we give notice of order cancellation in advance of applicable lead times as protection against component shortages and to provide replacement parts for our service teams we also stock limited supplies of certain key components for our products 

 

hardware platforms for our products consist primarily of commodity parts and certain custom components designed and approved by our hardware engineering group most of our components are purchased from sources which we believe are readily available from other suppliers however several components used in the assembly of our products are purchased from single or limited sources such as our proprietary packet velocity asic for layer 4 processing that is manufactured for us by a thirdparty contract semiconductor foundry 

 

competition 

 

the increasing breadth of our product offerings has enabled us to address a growing array of opportunities many of which are outside the bounds of the traditional layer 47 market within what gartner group calls the application acceleration market we compete in the application delivery controller adc market 

which encompasses the traditional layer 47 market and the wan optimization controller market over the next several years we believe these two market segments will merge as wan optimization effectively becomes a feature of application delivery with the availability of asm and webaccelerator as software modules on bigip these products have already become features of our overall adn solution and our strategic roadmap includes plans to integrate firepass with bigip over the next 12 to 18 months for the immediate future however the wan optimization and secure remote access application security market segments will continue to be viewed as discrete markets 

 

in 2008 approximately 88 of our products and services were sold into the adc market where our primary competitor is cisco systems inc other competitors in this market include citrix systems inc and to a lesser degree nortel networks corporation and radware ltd 

 

in the adjacent wan optimization market wanjet competes mainly with products from bluecoat systems cisco citrix juniper networks inc and riverbed technology inc none of our competitors offers an integrated product with advanced features comparable to webaccelerator 

 

in the ssl vpn remote access market we compete with juniper citrix nokia corporation nortel sonicwall inc symantec corporation and a number of smaller players because ssl vpns are a potential replacement for ipsec vpns the most widely deployed solution for secure remote access today we also compete with check point software technologies ltd which along with juniper is a market leader in ipsec vpns citrix offers a web firewall acquired from teros inc as a module on its netscaler products 

 

application firewalls represent an emerging market that is populated mainly by private earlydevelopmentstage companies other companies that have acquired products similar to asm include citrix systems none of our competitors offers a highperformance product similar to our application security module which is tightly integrated with our application delivery products 

 

file virtualization remains an earlystage market the growth of which has been slowed by the recent global economic downturn we believe our arx file virtualization products are unique in terms of technology and functionality and are well positioned within this emerging market however large storage vendors such as emc corporation netapp inc brocade communications systems inc and cisco offer competing products with overlapping functionality 

 

many of our competitors have a longer operating history and greater financial technical marketing and other resources than we do these larger competitors also have a more extensive customer base and broader customer relationships including relationships with many of our current and potential customers in addition many have large wellestablished worldwide customer support and professional services organizations and more extensive direct sales force and sales channels because of our relatively smaller size market presence and resources our larger competitors may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements these companies may also adopt aggressive pricing policies to gain market share as a result our competitors could undermine our ability to win new customers and maintain our existing customer base 

 

intellectual property 

 

we rely on a combination of patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights we have obtained 32 patents in the united states and have applications pending for various aspects of our technology our future success depends in part on our ability to protect our proprietary rights to the technologies used in our principal products despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use trade secrets or other information that we regard as proprietary in addition the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights as fully as do the laws of the united states any issued patent may not preserve our proprietary position and competitors or others may develop technologies similar to or superior to our technology our failure to enforce and protect our intellectual property rights could harm our business operating results and financial condition 

in addition to our own proprietary software we incorporate software licensed from several thirdparty sources into our products these licenses generally renew automatically on an annual basis we believe that alternative technologies for these licenses are available both domestically and internationally 

 

employees 

 

as of september 30 2008 we had 1694 fulltime employees including 460 in product development 716 in sales and marketing 323 in professional services and technical support and 195 in finance administration and operations none of our employees is represented by a labor union we have experienced no work stoppages and believe that our employee relations are good

tablestart 


 item 1a   risk factors tableend  

in addition to the other information in this report the following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating our company and its business 

 

our success depends on our timely development of new products and features market acceptance of new product offerings and proper management of the timing of the life cycle of our products 

 

the application delivery networking and file virtualization markets are characterized by rapid technological change frequent new product introductions changes in customer requirements and evolving industry standards our continued success depends on our ability to identify and develop new products and new features for our existing products to meet the demands of these changes and the acceptance of those products 

and features by our existing and target customers if we are unable to identify develop and deploy new products and new product features on a timely basis our business and results of operations may be harmed 

 

the current life cycle of our products is typically 12 to 24 months the introduction of new products or product enhancements may shorten the life cycle of our existing products or replace sales of some of our current products thereby offsetting the benefit of even a successful product introduction and may cause customers to defer purchasing our existing products in anticipation of the new products this could harm our operating results by decreasing sales increasing our inventory levels of older products and exposing us to greater risk of product obsolescence we have also experienced and may in the future experience delays in developing and releasing new products and product enhancements this has led to and may in the future lead to delayed sales increased expenses and lower quarterly revenue than anticipated also in the development of our products we have experienced delays in the prototyping of our products which in turn has led to delays in product introductions in addition complexity and difficulties in managing product transitions at the endoflife stage of a product can create excess inventory of components associated with the outgoing product that can lead to increased expenses any or all of the above problems could materially harm our business and results of operations 

 

our success depends on sales and continued innovation of our application delivery networking product lines 

 

for the fiscal year ended september 30 2008 we derived approximately 920 of our net product revenues or approximately 641 of our total net revenues from sales of our application delivery networking “adn” product lines we continue to expect to derive a significant portion of our net revenues from sales of our adn products in the future implementation of our strategy depends upon these products being able to solve critical network availability and performance problems of our customers if our adn products are unable to solve these problems for our customers or if we are unable to sustain the high levels of innovation in our adn product feature set needed to maintain leadership in what will continue to be a competitive market environment our business and results of operations will be harmed 

 

we may not be able to compete effectively in the emerging application delivery networking and file virtualization markets 

 

the markets we serve are new rapidly evolving and highly competitive and we expect competition to persist and intensify in the future our principal competitors in the application delivery networking market include cisco nortel citrix and radware in the adjacent wan optimization market we compete with riverbed juniper blue coat systems cisco and citrix in the file virtualization market we compete with emc netapp brocade and cisco we expect to continue to face additional competition as new participants enter our markets as we continue to expand globally we may see new competitors in different geographic regions in addition larger companies with significant resources brand recognition and sales channels may form alliances with or acquire competing application delivery networking solutions from other companies and emerge as significant competitors potential competitors may bundle their products or incorporate an internet traffic management or security component into existing products in a manner that discourages users from purchasing our products any of these circumstances may limit our opportunities for growth and negatively impact our financial performance 

 

our quarterly and annual operating results are inherently unpredictable and may cause our stock price to fluctuate 

 

our quarterly and annual operating results have varied significantly in the past and will vary significantly in the future which makes it difficult for us to predict our future operating results in particular we anticipate that the size of customer orders may increase as we continue to focus on larger business accounts a delay in the recognition of revenue even from just one account may have a significant negative impact on our results of operations for a given period in the past a majority of our sales have been realized near the end of a quarter accordingly a delay in an anticipated sale past the end of a particular quarter may negatively impact our results of operations for that quarter or in some cases that fiscal year additionally we have exposure to 

the credit risks of some of our customers and subtenants although we have programs in place that are designed to monitor and mitigate the associated risk there can be no assurance that such programs will be effective in reducing our credit risks adequately we monitor individual payment capability in granting credit arrangements seek to limit the total credit to amounts we believe our customers can pay and maintain reserves we believe are adequate to cover exposure for potential losses if there is a deterioration of a subtenant’s or a major customer’s creditworthiness or actual defaults are higher than expected future losses if incurred could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

 

further our operating results may be below the expectations of securities analysts and investors in future quarters or years our failure to meet these expectations will likely harm the market price of our common stock such a decline could occur and has occurred in the past even when we have met our publicly stated revenue andor earnings guidance 

 

the average selling price of our products may decrease and our costs may increase which may negatively impact gross profits 

 

it is possible that the average selling prices of our products will decrease in the future in response to competitive pricing pressures increased sales discounts new product introductions by us or our competitors or other factors therefore in order to maintain our gross profits we must develop and introduce new products and product enhancements on a timely basis and continually reduce our product costs our failure to do so will cause our net revenue and gross profits to decline which will harm our business and results of operations in addition we may experience substantial periodtoperiod fluctuations in future operating results due to the erosion of our average selling prices 

 

it is difficult to predict our future operating results because we have an unpredictable sales cycle 

 

our products have a lengthy sales cycle and the timing of our revenue is difficult to predict historically our sales cycle has ranged from approximately two to three months and has tended to lengthen as we have increasingly focused our sales efforts on the enterprise market also as our distribution strategy has evolved into more of a channel model utilizing valueadded resellers distributors and systems integrators the level of variability in the length of sales cycle across transactions has increased and made it more difficult to predict the timing of many of our sales transactions sales of our products require us to educate potential customers in their use and benefits sales of our products are subject to delays from the lengthy internal budgeting approval and competitive evaluation processes that large corporations and governmental entities may require for example customers frequently begin by evaluating our products on a limited basis and devote time and resources to testing our products before they decide whether or not to purchase customers may also defer orders as a result of anticipated releases of new products or enhancements by our competitors or us as a result our products have an unpredictable sales cycle that contributes to the uncertainty of our future operating results 

 

our business may be harmed if our contract manufacturers are not able to provide us with adequate supplies of our products or if a single source of hardware assembly is lost or impaired 

 

we outsource the manufacturing of our hardware platforms to third party contract manufacturers who assemble these hardware platforms to our specifications we have experienced minor delays in shipments from contract manufacturers in the past however if we experience major delays in the future or other problems such as inferior quality and insufficient quantity of product any one or a combination of these factors may harm our business and results of operations the inability of our contract manufacturers to provide us with adequate supplies of our products or the loss of one or more of our contract manufacturers may cause a delay in our ability to fulfill orders while we obtain a replacement manufacturer and may harm our business and results of operations in particular we currently subcontract manufacturing of our application delivery networking products to a single contract manufacturer with whom we do not have a longterm contract if our arrangement with this single source of hardware assembly was terminated or otherwise impaired and we were not able to engage another contract manufacturer in a timely manner our business financial condition and results of operation could be adversely affected 

if the demand for our products grows we will need to increase our raw material and component purchases contract manufacturing capacity and internal test and quality control functions any disruptions in product flow may limit our revenue may harm our competitive position and may result in additional costs or cancellation of orders by our customers 

 

our business could suffer if there are any interruptions or delays in the supply of hardware components from our thirdparty sources 

 

we currently purchase several hardware components used in the assembly of our products from a number of single or limited sources lead times for these components vary significantly the unavailability of suitable components any interruption or delay in the supply of any of these hardware components or the inability to procure a similar component from alternate sources at acceptable prices within a reasonable time may delay assembly and sales of our products and hence our revenues and may harm our business and results of operations 

 

we are subject to governmental export and import controls that could subject us to liability or impair our ability to compete in international markets 

 

our products are subject to us export controls and may be exported outside the us only with the required level of export license or through an export license exception because we incorporate encryption technology into our products in addition various countries regulate the import of certain encryption technology and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute our products or our customers’ ability to implement our products in those countries changes in our products or changes in export and import regulations may create delays in the introduction of our products in international markets prevent our customers with international operations from deploying our products throughout their global systems or in some cases prevent the export or import of our products to certain countries altogether any change in export or import regulations or related legislation shift in approach to the enforcement or scope of existing regulations or change in the countries persons or technologies targeted by such regulations could result in decreased use of our products by or in our decreased ability to export or sell our products to existing or potential customers with international operations for example we will need to comply with waste electrical and electronic equipment directive laws which are being adopted by certain european economic area countries on a countrybycountry basis failure to comply with these and similar laws on a timely basis or at all could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition any decreased use of our products or limitation on our ability to export or sell our products would likely adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

 

we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property and our products may infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties 

 

we rely on a combination of patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure of confidential and proprietary information to protect our intellectual property rights despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology monitoring unauthorized use of our products is difficult and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of our technology particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 

 

our industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the ordinary course of our business we are involved in disputes and licensing discussions with others regarding their claimed proprietary rights and cannot assure you that we will always successfully defend ourselves against such claims if we are found to infringe the proprietary rights of others or if we otherwise settle such claims we could be compelled to pay damages or royalties and either obtain a license to those intellectual property rights or alter our products so that they no longer infringe upon such proprietary rights any license could be very expensive to obtain or may not be available at all similarly changing our products or processes to avoid infringing upon the rights of others may be costly or impractical in addition we have initiated and may in the future initiate claims or 

litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to determine the scope and validity of our proprietary rights or those of our competitors any of these claims whether claims that we are infringing the proprietary rights of others or vice versa with or without merit may be timeconsuming result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel or require us to cease using infringing technology develop noninfringing technology or enter into royalty or licensing agreements further our license agreements typically require us to indemnify our customers distributors and resellers for infringement actions related to our technology which could cause us to become involved in infringement claims made against our customers distributors or resellers any of the abovedescribed circumstances relating to intellectual property rights disputes could result in our business and results of operations being harmed 

 

many of our products include intellectual property licensed from third parties in the future it may be necessary to renew licenses for third party intellectual property or obtain new licenses for other technology these third party licenses may not be available to us on acceptable terms if at all the inability to obtain certain licenses or litigation regarding the interpretation or enforcement of license rights and related intellectual property issues could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition furthermore we license some third party intellectual property on a nonexclusive basis and this may limit our ability to protect our intellectual property rights in our products 

 

we may not be able to sustain or develop new distribution relationships and a reduction or delay in sales to significant distribution partners could hurt our business 

 

we sell our products and services through multiple distribution channels in the united states and internationally including leading industry distributors valueadded resellers systems integrators and other indirect channel partners we have a limited number of agreements with companies in these channels and we may not be able to increase our number of distribution relationships or maintain our existing relationships recruiting and retaining qualified channel partners and training them in our technologies requires significant time and resources if we are unable to establish or maintain our indirect sales channels our business and results of operations will be harmed in addition two domestic distributors of our products together accounted for 245 and 248 of our total net revenue for the fiscal years 2008 and 2007 respectively a substantial reduction or delay in sales of our products to these distribution partners if not replaced by sales to other indirect channel partners and distributors could harm our business operating results and financial condition 

 

undetected software or hardware errors may harm our business and results of operations 

 

our products may contain undetected errors or defects when first introduced or as new versions are released we have experienced these errors or defects in the past in connection with new products and product upgrades we expect that these errors or defects will be found from time to time in new or enhanced products after commencement of commercial shipments these problems may cause us to incur significant warranty and repair costs divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts and cause significant customer relations problems we may also be subject to liability claims for damages related to product errors or defects while we carry insurance policies covering this type of liability these policies may not provide sufficient protection should a claim be asserted a material product liability claim may harm our business and results of operations 

 

our products must successfully operate with products from other vendors as a result when problems occur in a network it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem the occurrence of software or hardware problems whether caused by our products or another vendor’s products may result in the delay or loss of market acceptance of our products the occurrence of any of these problems may harm our business and results of operations 

 

adverse general economic conditions or reduced information technology spending may adversely impact our business 

 

a substantial portion of our business depends on the demand for information technology by large enterprise customers and service providers the overall economic health of our current and prospective 

customers and the continued growth and evolution of the internet national regional and local economic conditions such as recessionary economic cycles protracted economic slowdown or further deterioration of the economy could adversely impact demand for our products the purchase of our products is often discretionary and may involve a significant commitment of capital and other resources continued weak economic conditions or a reduction in information technology spending even if economic conditions improve would likely result in longer sales cycles and reduced product sales each of which would adversely impact our business results of operations and financial condition 

 

our investments in auction rate securities are subject to risks that may cause losses and affect the liquidity of these investments 

 

at september 30 2008 the fair value of our aaa rated municipal auction rate securities “ars” that were valued at reported market prices was approximately 475 million beginning in february 2008 auctions failed for approximately 534 million in par value of municipal ars we held because sell orders exceeded buy orders we may not be able to liquidate these investments and realize their full carrying value unless the issuer calls the security a successful auction occurs a buyer is found outside of the auction process or the security matures while we do not believe the decline in the carrying values of these municipal ars is permanent if the issuers of these securities are unable to successfully close future auctions and their credit ratings are lowered we may be required to record future impairment charges related to these investments which would harm our results of operations we believe these investments may remain illiquid for longer than twelve months and as a result we have classified these investments as longterm as of september 30 2008 

 

our operating results are exposed to risks associated with international commerce 

 

as our international sales increase our operating results become more exposed to international operating risks these risks include risks related to recessionary economic cycles or protracted slowdowns in economies outside the united states foreign currency exchange rates managing foreign sales offices regulatory political or economic conditions in specific countries military conflict or terrorist activities changes in laws and tariffs inadequate protection of intellectual property rights in foreign countries foreign regulatory requirements and natural disasters all of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business we intend to continue expanding into international markets international sales represented 425 and 416 of our net revenues for the fiscal years ended september 30 2008 and 2007 respectively in particular in fiscal year 2008 we derived 90 of our total revenue from the japanese market this revenue is dependent on a number of factors outside our control including the viability and success of our resellers and the strength of the japanese economy 

 

changes in governmental regulations could negatively affect our revenues 

 

our products are subject to various regulations promulgated by the united states and various foreign governments including but not limited to environmental regulations and regulations implementing export license requirements and restrictions on the import or export of some technologies especially encryption technology changes in governmental regulation and our inability or failure to obtain required approvals permits or registrations could harm our international and domestic sales and adversely affect our revenues business and operations 

 

acquisitions present many risks and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that are contemplated at the time of the transaction 

 

with respect to our past acquisitions as well as any other future acquisitions we may undertake we may find that the acquired businesses products or technologies do not further our business strategy as expected that we paid more than what the assets are later worth or that economic conditions change all of which may generate future impairment charges our acquisitions may be viewed negatively by customers financial markets or investors there may be difficulty integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired business and we may have difficulty retaining the key personnel of the acquired business we may have difficulty in integrating the acquired technologies or products with our existing product lines our ongoing business and 

management’s attention may be disrupted or diverted by transition or integration issues and the complexity of managing geographically and culturally diverse locations we may have difficulty maintaining uniform standards controls procedures and policies across locations we may experience significant problems or liabilities associated with product quality technology and other matters 

 

our inability to successfully operate and integrate newlyacquired businesses appropriately effectively and in a timely manner or to retain key personnel of any acquired business could have a material adverse effect on our ability to take advantage of further growth in demand for integrated traffic management and security solutions and other advances in technology as well as on our revenues gross margins and expenses 

 

our success depends on our key personnel and our ability to attract and retain qualified sales and marketing operations product development and professional services personnel 

 

our success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our key management product development sales marketing and finance personnel many of whom may be difficult to replace the complexity of our application delivery networking products and their integration into existing networks and ongoing support as well as the sophistication of our sales and marketing effort requires us to retain highly trained professional services customer support and sales personnel competition for qualified professional services customer support and sales personnel in our industry is intense because of the limited number of people available with the necessary technical skills and understanding of our products our ability to retain and hire these personnel may be adversely affected by volatility or reductions in the price of our common stock since these employees are generally granted restricted stock units or stock options the loss of services of any of our key personnel the inability to retain and attract qualified personnel in the future or delays in hiring qualified personnel may harm our business and results of operations 

 

we face litigation risks 

 

we are a party to lawsuits in the normal course of our business litigation in general and intellectual property and securities litigation in particular can be expensive lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations moreover the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict responding to lawsuits has been and will likely continue to be expensive and timeconsuming for us an unfavorable resolution of these lawsuits could adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

 

our historical stock option practices and the restatement of our prior financial statements have exposed us to greater risks associated with litigation beginning in may 2006 several derivative actions were filed against certain current and former directors and officers as discussed further in part ii item 8 note 7 “commitments and contingencies — litigation” based on allegations relating to our historical stock option practices we cannot assure you that this current litigation will result in the same conclusions reached by the special committee of outside directors formed by our board of directors to conduct a review of our stock option practices the “special committee” 

 

we may in the future be subject to additional litigation arising in relation to our historical stock option practices and the restatement of our prior financial statements litigation may be time consuming expensive and distracting for management from the conduct of our business the adverse resolution of any lawsuit could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we cannot assure you that any future litigation relating to our historical stock option practices will result in the same conclusions reached by the special committee furthermore if we are subject to adverse findings in any of these matters we could be required to pay damages or penalties or have other remedies imposed upon us which could adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

the matters relating to the special committee’s review of our historical stock option practices and the restatement of our consolidated financial statements has resulted in regulatory proceedings against us and may result in future regulatory proceedings which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition 

 

on november 8 2006 we announced that the special committee had completed its review of our historical stock option practices upon completion of its review the special committee found that the recorded grant dates for certain stock options granted during fiscal years 1999 to 2004 should be adjusted as the measurement date for accounting purposes and the accounting treatment used for the vesting of certain stock options was incorrect based on the special committee’s review to correct the accounting treatment we amended our annual report on form 10ka as amended for the year ended september 30 2005 and our quarterly reports on form 10q for the three months ended december 31 2005 and march 31 2006 to restate the consolidated financial statements contained in those reports 

 

in may 2006 we received notice from both the securities and exchange commission “sec” and the united states attorney’s office for the eastern district of new york the “department of justice” that they were conducting informal inquiries into our historical stock option practices we have fully cooperated with both agencies considerable legal and accounting expenses related to our historical stock option practices have been incurred and we may in the future be subject to additional regulatory proceedings or actions arising in relation to our historical stock option practices and the restatement of our prior period financial statements any potential regulatory proceeding or action may be time consuming expensive and distracting for management from the conduct of our business the adverse resolution of any potential regulatory proceeding or action could adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition we cannot assure you that the sec and department of justice inquiries or any future regulatory action relating to our historical stock option practices will result in the same conclusions reached by the special committee furthermore if we are subject to adverse findings in any of these matters we could be required to pay damages or penalties or have other remedies imposed upon us including criminal penalties which could adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

 

antitakeover provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us 

 

our board of directors has the authority to issue up to 10000000 shares of preferred stock and to determine the price rights preferences privileges and restrictions including voting rights of those shares without any further vote or action by the shareholders the rights of the holders of common stock may be subject to and may be adversely affected by the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future the issuance of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a change of control of our company without further action by our shareholders and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of the holders of common stock further certain provisions of our bylaws including a provision limiting the ability of stockholders to raise matters at a meeting of shareholders without giving advance notice may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or management of our company which could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock in addition our articles of incorporation provide for a staggered board which may make it more difficult for a third party to gain control of our board of directors similarly state antitakeover laws in the state of washington related to corporate takeovers may prevent or delay a change of control of our company

of our prior period financial statements although regulatory proceedings are subject to inherent uncertainties we do not believe the results of any pending actions will individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

 

we are not aware of any other pending legal proceedings than those mentioned above that individually or in the aggregate would have a material adverse effect on our business operating results or financial condition we may in the future be party to litigation arising in the ordinary course of business including claims that we allegedly infringe upon thirdparty trademarks or other intellectual property rights such claims even if not meritorious could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources

critical accounting policies 

 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

 

we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements 

revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with the guidance provided under statement of position “sop” no 972 “software revenue recognition” and sop no 989 “modification of sop no 972 software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions” statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 48 “revenue recognition when right of return exists” and sec staff accounting bulletin “sab” no 101 “revenue recognition in financial statements” and sab no 104 “revenue recognition” 

 

we sell products through distributors resellers and directly to end users we recognize product revenue upon shipment net of estimated returns provided that collection is determined to be probable and no significant obligations remain in certain regions where we do not have the ability to reasonably estimate returns we defer revenue on sales to our distributors until we receive information from the channel partner indicating that the distributor has sold the product to its customer payment terms to domestic customers are generally net 30 days to net 45 days payment terms to international customers range from net 30 days to net 90 days based on normal and customary trade practices in the individual markets we have offered extended payment terms ranging from three to six months to certain customers in which case revenue is recognized when payments are made 

 

whenever product training and postcontract customer support “pcs” elements are combined into a package with a single “bundled” price a portion of the sales price is allocated to each element of the bundled package based on their respective fair values as determined when the individual elements are sold separately we determine fair value based on the type of customer and region in which the package is sold where fair value of certain elements are not available we recognize revenue on the “residual method” permitted under sop 989 based on the fair value of undelivered elements revenues from the sale of product are recognized when the product has been shipped and the customer is obligated to pay for the product when rights of return are present and we cannot estimate returns we recognize revenue when such rights of return lapse revenues for pcs are recognized on a straightline basis over the service contract term pcs includes a limited period of telephone support updates repair or replacement of any failed product or component that fails during the term of the agreement bug fixes and rights to upgrades when and if available consulting services are customarily billed at fixed rates plus outofpocket expenses and revenues are recognized when the consulting has been completed training revenue is recognized when the training has been completed 

 

reserve for doubtful accounts estimates are used in determining our allowance for doubtful accounts and are based upon an assessment of selected accounts and as a percentage of our remaining accounts receivable by aging category in determining these percentages we evaluate historical writeoffs current trends in the credit quality of our customer base as well as changes in the credit policies we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition and do not require any collateral if there is deterioration of a major customer’s credit worthiness or actual defaults are higher than our historical experience our allowance for doubtful accounts may not be sufficient 

 

reserve for product returns in some instances product revenue from distributors is subject to agreements allowing rights of return product returns are estimated based on historical experience and are recorded at the time revenues are recognized accordingly we reduce recognized revenue for estimated future returns at the time revenue is recorded when rights of return are present and we cannot estimate returns revenue is recognized when such rights lapse the estimates for returns are adjusted periodically based upon changes in historical rates of returns and other related factors it is possible that these estimates will change in the future or that the actual amounts could vary from our estimates 

 

reserve for warranties a warranty reserve is established based on our historical experience and an estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date to those customers with no service contract while we believe that our warranty reserve is adequate and that the judgment applied is appropriate such amounts estimated to be due and payable could differ materially from what will actually transpire in the future 

 

accounting for income taxes we utilize the liability method of accounting for income taxes as set forth in sfas no 109 “accounting for income taxes” “sfas 109” accordingly we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate as part of the process of preparing our 

consolidated financial statements this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure including assessing the risks associated with tax audits together with assessing temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities due to the evolving nature and complexity of tax rules combined with the large number of jurisdictions in which we operate it is possible that our estimates of our tax liability could change in the future which may result in additional tax liabilities and adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

 

effective at the beginning of fiscal 2008 we adopted financial interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes — an interpretation of fasb statement no 109” “fin 48” further information may be found in note 5 “income taxes” in the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form 10k 

 

stockbased compensation we account for stockbased compensation in accordance with financial accounting standards board “fasb” statement no 123r “sharebased payment” “fas 123r” using the straightline attribution method for recognizing compensation expense we recognized 606 million and 412 million of stockbased compensation expense for the years ended september 30 2008 and 2007 respectively as of september 30 2008 there was 829 million of total unrecognized stockbased compensation cost the majority of which will be recognized over the next two years going forward stockbased compensation expenses may increase as we issue additional equitybased awards to continue to attract and retain key employees 

 

we issue incentive awards to our employees through stockbased compensation consisting of stock options and restricted stock units “rsus” the value of rsus is determined using the fair value method which in this case is based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock on the date of grant alternatively in determining the fair value of stock options we use the blackscholes option pricing model that employs the following key assumptions expected volatility is based on the annualized daily historical volatility of our stock price over the expected life of the option expected term of the option is based on historical employee stock option exercise behavior the vesting terms of the respective option and a contractual life of ten years our stock price volatility and option lives involve management’s best estimates at that time both of which impact the fair value of the option calculated under the blackscholes methodology and ultimately the expense that will be recognized over the life of the option 

 

fas 123r also requires that we recognize compensation expense for only the portion of stock options or rsus that are expected to vest therefore we apply estimated forfeiture rates that are derived from historical employee termination behavior in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 we began estimating forfeitures by class of employee to better reflect our historical behavior based on historical differences with forfeitures of stockbased awards granted to our executive officers and board of directors versus grants awarded to all other employees we developed separate forfeiture expectations for these two groups in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 the estimated forfeiture rate for grants awarded to our executive officers and board of directors was approximately 4 and the estimated forfeiture rate for grants awarded to all other employees was approximately 10 if the actual number of forfeitures differs from those estimated by management additional adjustments to stockbased compensation expense may be required in future periods 

 

compensation cost recognized for the year ended september 30 2008 includes a compensation cost for all sharebased payments granted prior to but not yet vested as of july 1 2005 based on the grantdate fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of fasb statement no 123 “ accounting for stockbased compensation” and b compensation cost for all sharebased payments granted subsequent to july 1 2005 based on the grantdate fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of fas 123r 

 

in august 2008 we granted 383400 rsus to certain current executive officers fifty percent of the aggregate number of rsus granted at such time vest in equal quarterly increments over two years until such portion of the grant is fully vested on august 1 2010 twentyfive percent of the rsu grant or a portion thereof is subject to our achievement of specified percentage increases in total revenue during the period beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008 through the third quarter of fiscal year 2009 relative to the same periods in fiscal years 2007 and 2008 the executive officers can receive additional rsus in amounts up 

to 25 of that number of rsus subject to this total revenue increase target if the target is exceeded the remaining twentyfive percent is subject to our achievement of specified percentage increases in total revenue during the period beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009 through the third quarter of fiscal year 2010 relative to the same periods in fiscal years 2008 and 2009 as will be set by the compensation committee of our board of directors 

 

in august 2007 we granted 276400 rsus to certain current executive officers fifty percent of the aggregate number of rsus granted at such time vest in equal quarterly increments over two years until such portion of the grant is fully vested on august 1 2009 twentyfive percent of the rsu grant is subject to our achievement of specified percentage increases in total revenue during the period beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007 through the third quarter of fiscal year 2008 relative to the same periods in fiscal years 2006 and 2007 this twentyfive percent was fully earned in fiscal 2008 the remaining twentyfive percent is subject to our achievement of specified percentage increases in total revenue during the period beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008 through the third quarter of fiscal year 2009 relative to the same periods in fiscal years 2007 and 2008 as set by the compensation committee of our board of directors 

 

in december 2006 we granted 456000 rsus to certain current executive officers fifty percent of the aggregate number of rsus granted at such time vest in equal quarterly increments over two years until such portion of the grant is fully vested on november 1 2008 twentyfive percent of the rsu grant was subject to our achievement of specified percentage increases in total revenue for fiscal year 2007 relative to fiscal year 2006 this twentyfive percent was fully earned in fiscal 2007 the remaining twentyfive percent was subject to our achievement of specified percentage increases in total revenue for fiscal year 2008 relative to fiscal year 2007 this twentyfive percent was fully earned in fiscal 2008 

 

we recognize compensation costs for awards with performance conditions when we conclude it is probable that the performance condition will be achieved we reassess the probability of vesting at each balance sheet date and adjust compensation costs based on our probability assessment 

 

on january 23 2008 we announced that our board of directors had approved a new program to repurchase up to 200 million of our outstanding common stock as of september 30 2008 we had completed the repurchase and repurchased and retired approximately 77 million shares at an average price of 2590 per share 

 

goodwill and intangible assets we have a significant amount of goodwill and intangible assets on our balance sheet related to acquisitions intangible assets are carried and reported at acquisition cost net of accumulated amortization subsequent to acquisition intangible assets are amortized over the estimated useful lives which generally range from three to five years intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate impairment might exist in accordance with sfas no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” projected undiscounted net cash flows expected to be derived from the use of those assets are compared to the respective net carrying amounts to determine whether any impairment exists impairment if any is based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets 

 

the determination of the net carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets and the extent to which if any there is impairment are dependent on material estimates and judgments on our part including the useful life over which the intangible assets are to be amortized and the estimates of the value of future net cash flows which are based upon further estimates of future revenues expenses and operating margins in applying sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” we review our goodwill annually for impairment in the second fiscal quarter or more frequently when indicators of impairment are present as a result of the current economic environment we reevaluated our goodwill and intangible assets at september 30 2008 and concluded that there were no indicators of impairment 

 

investments our investments are diversified among highcredit quality debt securities in accordance with our investment policy we classify our investments as availableforsale which are reported at fair market value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss in stockholders’ equity realized gains and losses and declines in value of investments judged to be other than 

temporary are included in other income expense to date we have not deemed it necessary to record any charges related to otherthantemporary declines in the estimated fair values of our marketable debt securities however the fair value of our investments is subject to volatility declines in the fair value of our investments judged to be other than temporary could adversely affect our future operating results we used the income approach to determine the fair value of our auction rate securities “ars” using a discounted cash flow analysis the assumptions we used in preparing the discounted cash flow model include estimates for interest rates estimates for discount rates using yields of comparable traded instruments adjusted for illiquidity and other risk factors amount of cash flows and expected holding periods for the ars we believe these investments may remain illiquid for longer than twelve months and as a result we have classified these investments as longterm as of september 30 2008 

 

results of operations 

 

the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

 

 

 

net revenues total net revenues increased 237 in fiscal year 2008 from fiscal year 2007 compared to an increase of 334 in fiscal year 2007 from fiscal year 2006 the revenue growth was due to increased demand for our core adn products and revenue from our arx file virtualization products in addition service revenues contributed to the overall revenue growth as a result of our increased installed base of products international revenues represented 425 416 and 426 of net revenues in fiscal years 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively we expect international sales will continue to represent a significant portion of net revenues although we cannot provide assurance that international revenues as a percentage of net revenues will remain at current levels 

 

net product revenues increased 153 in fiscal year 2008 from fiscal year 2007 and 289 in fiscal year 2007 as compared to fiscal year 2006 the increase of 600 million in net product sales for fiscal year 2008 was primarily due to growth in the volume of product sales of our adn products of 454 million in addition net product revenue from our arx file virtualization products introduced at the end of fiscal year 2007 increased 176 million sales of our adn products represented 920 945 and 938 of total product revenues in fiscal years 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively 

 

net service revenues increased 486 in fiscal year 2008 from fiscal year 2007 and 489 in fiscal year 2007 as compared to the fiscal year 2006 the increases in service revenue were the result of increased purchases or renewals of maintenance contracts as our installed base of products continues to increase 

 

ingram micro inc one of our domestic distributors accounted for 105 116 and 136 of our total net revenues in fiscal years 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively avnet technology solutions another domestic distributor accounted for 140 132 and 116 of our total net revenue in fiscal years 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively avnet technology solutions accounted for 105 of our accounts receivable as of september 30 2008 

 

 

 

cost of net product revenues cost of net product revenues consist of finished products purchased from our contract manufacturers manufacturing overhead freight warranty provisions for excess and obsolete inventory and amortization expenses in connection with developed technology from acquisitions product cost increased to 1024 million in fiscal year 2008 as compared to 841 million and 636 million in fiscal years 2007 and 2006 respectively the year over year increases were primarily due to a higher volume of units shipped the fiscal year 2008 increase also included shipments of our arx file virtualization products and increased indirect manufacturing costs over prior periods the fiscal year 2007 increase also include an increase in warranty expense and indirect manufacturing cost over the prior period 

 

cost of net service revenues cost of net service revenues consist of the salaries and related benefits of our professional services staff travel facilities and depreciation expenses cost of net service revenues as a percentage of net service revenues decreased to 236 in fiscal year 2008 from 258 in fiscal year 2007 and 275 in fiscal year 2006 primarily due to the scalability of our existing customer support infrastructure and increased revenue from maintenance contracts the absolute dollar increase year over year is primarily due to increased salary and benefits attributed to growth in headcount professional services headcount at the end of fiscal year 2008 increased to 323 from 279 at the end of fiscal year 2007 and 205 at the end of fiscal year 2006 going forward we expect to continue to increase our cost of service revenues to support our expanded product lines and growing customer base 

 

 

 

sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses consist of salaries commissions and related benefits of our sales and marketing staff the costs of our marketing programs including public relations advertising and trade shows travel facilities and depreciation expenses sales and marketing expense increased 351 in fiscal year 2008 as compared to 377 and 419 in fiscal years 2007 and 2006 respectively the increase in sales and marketing expense was primarily due to increased commissions and personnel costs which totaled 423 million 254 million and 210 million for fiscal years 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively which is consistent with the increased revenue for the corresponding periods the fiscal year 2008 increase over the prior period was primarily due to a full year of expenses related to our arx file virtualization personnel as compared to the 17 days of comparable expenses in fiscal year 2007 sales and marketing headcount at the end of fiscal 2008 increased to 716 from 669 at the end of fiscal 2007 and 442 at the end of fiscal 2006 stockbased compensation charges of 241 million 158 million and 101 million also contributed to the overall increase in fiscal years 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively we expect to continue to increase sales and marketing expenses in order to grow revenues and increase our market share 

 

research and development research and development expenses consist of the salaries and related benefits for our product development personnel prototype materials and expenses related to the development of new and improved products facilities and depreciation expenses research and development expenses increased 498 in fiscal year 2008 as compared to increases of 404 and 560 in fiscal years 2007 and 2006 respectively the increase in research and development expense was primarily due to increased personnel costs which totaled 197 million 122 million and 84 million in fiscal years 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively which is consistent with the increased revenue for the corresponding periods the fiscal year 2008 increase over the prior period was primarily due to a full year of expenses related to our arx file virtualization personnel as compared to the 17 days of comparable expenses in fiscal year 2007 research and development headcount at the end of fiscal 2008 increased to 460 from 450 at the end of fiscal 2007 and 287 at the end of fiscal 2006 the growth in headcount was primarily related to the enhancement of our current products the development of new technologically advanced products that meet the changing needs of our customers and additional headcount related to our arx file virtualization products stockbased compensation charges of 163 million 102 million and 69 million also contributed to the overall increase in fiscal years 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively we expect to continue to increase research and development expenses as our future success is dependent on the continued development of our products 

 

general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist of the salaries benefits and related costs of our executive finance information technology human resource and legal personnel thirdparty 

professional service fees bad debt charges facilities and depreciation expenses general and administrative expenses increased 137 in fiscal year 2008 as compared with 259 in fiscal year 2007 and 535 in fiscal year 2006 the increase in fiscal year 2008 of 67 million was due primarily to an increase of 32 million in stockbased compensation charges and an increase of 35 million in salary and benefit expenses the increase in fiscal year 2007 of 101 million was due primarily to increases of 65 million in stockbased compensation charges 40 million in salary and benefit expenses and 31 million in other general operating expenses general and administrative headcount at the end of fiscal 2008 increased to 195 from 184 at the end of fiscal 2007 and 134 at the end of fiscal 2006 general and administrative expense is expected to remain at these increased levels as we continue to build our infrastructure to support the worldwide growth of our business 

 

inprocess research and development acquired inprocess research and development “iprd” expense was 140 million in 2007 and reflects the amount allocated to iprd that we acquired in the acopia networks inc “acopia” acquisition iprd represents the present value of estimated aftertax cash flows expected to be generated by purchased technology which at the acquisition date had not yet reached technological feasibility we based our estimates and projections related to iprd on assumptions we believed to be reasonable at the time of the acquisition but that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable if we do not successfully develop this product our business operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected 

 

loss on facility exit and sublease during 2008 we exited a research and development facility in bellevue washington for which there was remaining operating lease obligations through 2014 in addition during this period we consolidated our corporate headquarters partially subleasing the building located at 333 elliott avenue west in seattle washington for which there was remaining operating lease obligations through 2018 as a result of the expected loss on the facility exit and sublease agreements we recorded a charge of 53 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 pursuant to sfas no 146 “accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities” “sfas 146” and ftb no 7915 “accounting for loss on a sublease not involving the disposal of a segment” “ftb 7915” 

 

 

 

other income net other income net consists of interest income and foreign currency transaction gains and losses other income net decreased 328 in fiscal year 2008 as compared to fiscal year 2007 and increased 617 in fiscal year 2007 as compared to the fiscal years 2006 interest income was 175 million 273 million and 172 million for fiscal years 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively the decrease in other income net for fiscal year 2008 compared to fiscal year 2007 was primarily due to decreased interest income as a result of reduced investment balances partially offset by cash provided from operating and investing 

activities investment balances decreased in fiscal year 2008 as a result of the repurchase of outstanding common stock under our stock repurchase program and additional cash required for the acquisition of acopia in september 2007 the fiscal year 2007 increase was due to a combination of higher yields and increased investment balance over the prior period the increased investment balances in fiscal year 2007 and 2006 are the result of additional cash provided from operating and financing activities during the respective fiscal years 

 

provision for income taxes we recorded a 371 provision for income taxes for the fiscal year 2008 compared to 397 in fiscal year 2007 and 386 in fiscal year 2006 the reduction in the effective tax rate from fiscal year end 2007 to fiscal year end 2008 is largely attributable to an increase in the us domestic manufacturing deduction and a decrease in the limitation on deductibility of the compensation of certain officers 

 

at september 30 2008 we did not have a valuation allowance on any of our deferred tax assets in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate because we believe that the assets are more likely than not to be realized in making this determination we have considered projected future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the appropriateness of a valuation allowance our net deferred tax assets as of fiscal year end 2008 2007 and 2006 were 528 million 433 million and 233 million respectively our worldwide effective tax rate may fluctuate based on a number of factors including variations in projected taxable income in our various geographic locations in which we operate changes in the valuation of our net deferred tax assets resolution of potential exposures tax positions taken on tax returns filed in the various geographic locations in which we operate and the introduction of new accounting standards or changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof in the various geographic locations in which we operate we have recorded liabilities to address potential tax exposures related to business and income tax positions we have taken that could be challenged by taxing authorities the ultimate resolution of these potential exposures may be greater or less than the liabilities recorded which could result in an adjustment to our future tax expense 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

we have funded our operations with our cash balances cash generated from operations and proceeds from public offerings of our securities 

 

 

 

cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and longterm investments totaled 4513 million as of september 30 2008 compared to 4748 million as of september 30 2007 representing a decrease of 235 million the decrease was primarily due to approximately 200 million of cash used to repurchase outstanding common stock under our stock repurchase program in fiscal 2008 which amount was largely offset by cash provided by operating activities of 1937 million for the year ended september 30 2008 in fiscal year 2007 overall cash provided by investing activities decreased 174 million compared to fiscal year 2006 the net decrease was primarily due to cash requirements for the purchase of acopia in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 which amounts were partially offset by cash flow from operations 

 

at september 30 2008 we held 523 million par value of longterm investments comprised of taxexempt ars which are variablerate debt securities and have a longterm maturity with the interest being reset through dutch auctions that are typically held every 7 28 or 35 days the securities have historically traded at par and are callable at par at the option of the issuer interest is typically paid at the end of each auction period or semiannually we limit our investments in ars to securities that carry an aaa or equivalent rating from recognized rating agencies and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 

at the time of initial investment and at the date of this annual report on form 10k all of our ars remain aaa rated 

 

beginning in february 2008 auctions failed for approximately 534 million in par value of municipal ars we held because sell orders exceeded buy orders when these auctions failed to clear higher interest rates for those securities went into effect however the funds associated with these failed auctions will not be accessible until the issuer calls the security a successful auction occurs a buyer is found outside of the auction process or the security matures the underlying assets of the municipal ars we hold including the securities for which auctions have failed are generally student loans which are guaranteed by the us government 

 

we have no reason to believe that any of the underlying issuers of our ars are presently at risk of default through september 30 2008 we have continued to receive interest payments on the ars in accordance with their terms we believe we will be able to liquidate our investments without significant loss primarily due to the government guarantee of the underlying securities however due to recent changes and uncertainty in the ars market we believe these investments may remain illiquid for longer than twelve months and as a result we have classified these investments as longterm as of september 30 2008 we currently have the ability and the intent to hold these ars investments until recovery of the auction process or until maturity 

 

cash provided by operating activities during fiscal year 2008 was 1937 million compared to 1697 million in fiscal year 2007 and 1254 million in fiscal year 2006 cash provided by operating activities resulted primarily from cash generated from net income after adjusting for noncash charges such as stockbased compensation depreciation and amortization charges and changes in operating assets and liabilities 

 

cash provided by investing activities was 137 million for fiscal year 2008 compared to cash used in investing activities of 1881 million for fiscal year 2007 and 2044 million for fiscal year 2006 the cash provided by investing activities in fiscal year 2008 was primarily the result of the sale of investments partially offset by the purchase of investments the cash used in fiscal year 2007 was primarily the result of the purchase of investments partially offset by the sale of investments and 2071 million of cash payments net of cash acquired to shareholders of acopia which was acquired in september 2007 the cash used in fiscal year 2006 was primarily due to the purchase of investments and property and equipment partially offset by the sale of investments 

 

cash used in financing activities was 1817 million for fiscal year 2008 compared to cash provided by financing activities of 355 million and 651 million in fiscal years 2007 and 2006 respectively in the second quarter of fiscal 2008 our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program to repurchase up to 200 million of the company’s outstanding common stock cash used in financing activities for fiscal 2008 included 200 million to repurchase common stock under this plan which was partially offset by the exercise of employee stock options and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan during fiscal years 2007 and 2006 our financing activities consisted entirely of cash proceeds and tax benefits received from the exercise of stock options and stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan 

 

we expect that our existing cash and investment balances and cash from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated working capital and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future 

obligations and commitments 

 

the following table summarizes our contractual payment obligations and commitments as of september 30 2008 

 

 

 

we lease our facilities under operating leases that expire at various dates through 2018 we have excluded from the above table the impact of approximately 42 million related to unrecognized income tax benefits as of september 30 2008 due to the adoption of fasb interpretation no 48 “ accounting for uncertainty in income taxes — an interpretation of fasb statement no 109 ” we cannot make reliable estimates of the future cash flows by period related to this obligation 

 

purchase obligations are comprised of purchase commitments with our contract manufacturers the agreement with our primary contract manufacturer allows them to procure component inventory on our behalf based on our production forecast we are obligated to purchase component inventory that the contract manufacturer procures in accordance with the forecast unless cancellation is given within applicable lead times 

 

recent accounting pronouncements 

 

in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 160 “noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements — an amendment of accounting research bulletin no 51” “sfas 160” which amends accounting research bulletin no 51 to establish accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary sfas 160 is effective for the company’s fiscal years beginning october 1 2010 the company does not expect the adoption of sfas 160 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 

in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 141r “business combinations” “sfas 141r”  which establishes principles and requirements for recognizing and measuring identifiable assets and goodwill acquired liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in an acquisition at their fair value as of the acquisition date sfas 141r is effective for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after october 1 2009 this standard will change the company’s accounting treatment for business combinations on a prospective basis 

 

in february 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 159 “the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities” “sfas 159” which allows entities to measure eligible financial instruments and certain other items at fair value the statement also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities sfas 159 is effective for the company’s fiscal years beginning october 1 2008 the company is currently assessing the potential effect if any of implementing this standard but does not expect it to have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements 

 

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 157 “fair value measurements” “sfas 157” which defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements in february 2008 the fasb released a fasb staff position fsp fas 1572  effective date of fasb statement no 157  which delays the effective date of sfas no 157 for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually to fiscal years beginning after november 15 2008 the company adopted this standard on october 1 2008 the company is currently assessing the potential effect if any of 

implementing this standard but does not expect it to have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements 

 

tablestart 


 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk tableend  

interest rate risk our cash equivalents consist of highquality securities as specified in our investment policy guidelines the policy limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue or issuer to a maximum of 5 of the total portfolio with the exception of us treasury securities commercial paper and money market funds which are exempt from size limitation the policy requires investments in securities that mature in three years or less with the average maturity being no greater than one and a half years these securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if interest rates increase a decrease of one percent in the average interest rate would have resulted in a decrease of approximately 37 million in our interest income for the fiscal year 2008 

 

 

at september 30 2008 the fair value of our aaa rated municipal ars was approximately 475 million ars are collateralized longterm debt instruments that provide liquidity through a dutch auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at predetermined intervals typically every 7 28 or 35 days beginning in february 2008 auctions failed for approximately 534 million in par value of municipal ars we held because sell orders exceeded buy orders when these auctions failed to clear higher interest rates for those securities went into effect however the funds associated with these failed auctions will not be accessible until the issuer calls the security a successful auction occurs a buyer is found outside of the auction process or the security matures the underlying assets of the municipal ars we hold including the securities for which auctions have failed are generally student loans which are guaranteed by the us government based on our expected operating cash flows and our other sources of cash we do not believe that any reduction in liquidity of our municipal ars will have a material impact on our overall ability to meet our liquidity needs we have the intent and ability to hold these securities until liquidation these securities have been classified as longterm at september 30 2008 based on the fact that we believe it could take longer than twelve months to liquidate the positions 

 

foreign currency risk the majority of our sales and expenses are denominated in us dollars and as a result we have not experienced significant foreign currency transaction gains and losses to date while we have conducted some transactions in foreign currencies during the fiscal year ended september 30 2008 and expect to continue to do so we do not anticipate that foreign currency transaction gains or losses will be significant at our current level of operations however as we continue to expand our operations internationally transaction gains or losses may become significant in the future we have not engaged in foreign currency hedging to date however we may do so in the future

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

 

the company maintains disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “exchange act” that are designed to ensure that required information is recorded processed summarized and reported within the required timeframe as specified in the rules set forth by the securities exchange commission our disclosure controls and procedures are also designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated to management including the chief executive officer and chief accounting officer to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures 

 

our management with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief accounting officer evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of september 30 2008 and based on this evaluation our chief executive officer and chief accounting officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of september 30 2008 

 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

 

management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in exchange act rules 13a15f and 15d15f internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 

 

internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override because of such limitations there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting however these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process therefore it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce though not eliminate this risk 

 

management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of september 30 2008 in making this assessment management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission in internal control — integrated framework  based on the results of this assessment and on those criteria management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of september 30 2008 

 

the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of september 30 2008 has been audited by pricewaterhousecoopers llp an independent registered public accounting firm as stated in their report which appears herein 

 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

 

during the fourth fiscal quarter there were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting that materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal controls over financial reporting

 item 1 business 

general 

f5 networks inc is a leading provider of application delivery networking products that improve the performance availability and security of applications running on networks that use the internet protocol ip ip traffic between servers running applications and clients using those applications passes through our products where the content is inspected to ensure that it is delivered securely and in a way that optimizes the performance and availability of both the network and the applications 

our bigip products help manage ip traffic between network servers clients and other devices in a way that maximizes the availability scalability and throughput of those network components and the applications that run on them our complementary firepass ssl vpn products let enterprises provide anyone connected to the internet with secure remote access to their corporate networks and applications by leveraging standard web browser technology our trafficshield application firewall which is available as a standalone appliance and as a software module on bigip provides contentbased applicationlevel security against malicious attacks that network firewalls and other security devices can’t prevent our bigip products share a common fullproxy operating system tmos or traffic management operating system that enables them to inspect and modify traffic flows to and from servers and has builtin functionality to secure optimize and ensure the availability of application traffic our application delivery networking products that are integrated on the tmos platform also share a common software interface called icontrol which enables them to communicate with one another and allows them to be integrated with third party products including custom and commercial enterprise applications 

the flexibility of our softwarebased technology the breadth of functionality available on our products and the integration of that functionality through icontrol and tmos are characteristics that we believe differentiate our products from other application delivery networking products these characteristics enable us to provide comprehensive solutions that address many elements required for ipbased networks and business applications including high availability high performance intelligent traffic management streamlined manageability bandwidth optimization remote access to corporate networks and network and application security in connection with our products we offer a broad range of services including consulting training installation maintenance and other technical support services 

on october 4 2005 we acquired swan labs inc or swan labs for 43 million in cash as a result of the transaction we acquired all the assets of swan labs including its principal products wanjet and webaccelerator wanjet devices are deployed in 

data centers and branch offices to speed up file transfers email and the performance of any ipbased application that runs over a wide area network wan webaccelerator works in concert with wanjet to speed up the performance of ipbased enterprise applications running over wans the acquisition of swan labs expands our product line and gives us broader access to the wan optimization and web acceleration markets 

we were incorporated on february 26 1996 in the state of washington our headquarters is in seattle washington and our mailing address is 401 elliott avenue west seattle washington 98119 the telephone number at our executive offices is 206 2725555 we have subsidiaries or branch offices in australia canada china france germany hong kong israel japan malaysia northern ireland russia singapore south korea taiwan thailand and the united kingdom our annual reports on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and all amendments to those reports are available free of charge on our website wwwf5com as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with the securities and exchange commission the information found on our internet site is not part of this or any other report we file with or furnish to the securities and exchange commission

industry background 

internet protocol ip is a communications language used to transmit data over the internet since the late 1990’s businesses have responded to the power flexibility and economy of the internet by deploying new ipbased applications upgrading their clientserver applications to new ipenabled versions and enabling existing or legacy applications for use over the internet over the next several years we believe this process will accelerate as more and more organizations discover the benefits of deploying ipenabled applications and new technologies continue to enhance the performance reliability and security of both applications and ip networks in addition we believe the growth of internet usage will continue to be driven by new applications such as web services voice over ip increased penetration of broadband internet access enabling the remote use of more applications and the increasing popularity of mobile internet access through wireless devices such as cellular telephones pdas and notebook computers 

internet architecture 

ip requires all data transmitted across the internet to be divided into packets at the source and reassembled at the destination the open systems interconnect osi reference model is the framework that divides network functions into seven layers and specifies how the layers should interact to enable all of a network’s different hardware and software components to work together to accomplish this process prior to transmission each packet of data is automatically given a header that identifies the source and destination of the packet this header information is used in the osi model for the purposes of identifying routing and sequencing data packets and is stripped from the data upon arrival at its destination layers 24 of the osi model perform standardized repetitive tasks such as ensuring that packets of information sent over the internet arrive at the destination to which they are addressed and are reassembled in the correct sequence consequently most layer 24 switches are hardwarebased devices that use applicationspecific integrated circuits asics and are optimized for speed unlike layers 24 layer 7 which in practice includes the functions ascribed to layers 5 and 6 in the osi model is complex and variable and must support enduser applications and processes on a wide variety of platforms and devices while most layer 4 switches rely on hardwarebased architectures to maximize throughput the demands of processing data at layer 7 increasingly require flexibility and adaptability that can be achieved only through a softwarebased solution the challenge in building highly flexible functionrich softwarebased switches for application delivery networking is to deliver these capabilities at speeds that do not slow the speed of network traffic 

application delivery networking 

as more applications are ipenabled there is growing demand for layer 7 technology that can read the entire contents or flow of data in a packetized transmission and make intelligent decisions based on a dynamic set of business rules about how to handle the transmission to make the applications network and servers always secure fast and available basic layer 7 functions include loadbalancing distributing traffic across multiple servers while making them appear to be a single server and healthchecking monitoring the performance of servers and applications to ensure that they are working properly before routing traffic to them in addition layer 7 processing encompasses a growing number of functions that have typically been performed by the server or the application itself or by point solutions running on separate devices functions in this category include ssl acceleration — using secure socket layer ssl encryption to secure traffic between the server and the browser on an end user’s client device rate 

shaping — prioritizing transmissions according to preset rules that give precedence to different types of traffic compression — reducing the volume of data transmitted to take maximum advantage of available bandwidth tcp optimization — improving server efficiency by maintaining an open connection with a server during interactive sessions ipv6 translation — enabling communication and interoperability between networked devices using ipv6 the newest version of the internet protocol and those using the older version ipv4 and modifying the content of a transaction to improve security 

in addition to optimizing the performance and availability of their networks and applications enterprises face the increasingly complex challenge of providing security for applications and data that are accessible over their ip networks layer 7 or application level security includes three basic components providing employees partners and customers with secure access to corporate applications ensuring that access is limited to those applications for which a user is specifically authorized and protecting the integrity of applications and data 

currently the most widespread solution for secure remote access is technology that uses the ip security ipsec protocol to establish a secure virtual private network vpn between a remote device such as a user’s home pc or a laptop and the corporate network although an ipsec vpn tunnel is very secure it has a number of drawbacks one is that ipsec requires the remote device to have special software installed on it and maintaining the most current version of this software on all user devices is time consuming and costly a more serious issue is that once ipsec establishes a connection between a user and the corporate network the user has full access to any application in the network and the only way to prevent unauthorized use is to secure each application or physically segment the network as an alternative to using ipsec vpns for remote access technology that employs ssl encryption to establish a secure vpn has emerged and is making rapid inroads in the market because this technology relies on the ssl capabilities resident in any standard web browser it is not necessary to install additional software on the remote device this makes it possible to access the network from a cell phone pda kiosk laptop pc or any other device with a standard browser in addition ssl vpn technology supports the creation of separate vpn tunnels to each application for which a user is authorized this allows enterprises to exercise more control over who can gain access to various parts of the network and to specific applications 

along with the need to provide secure connectivity between users and applications enterprises face an immediate and growing need to protect applications and other data center resources from applicationlevel security threats that pass through conventional firewalls and slip past intrusion detection and prevention ids and ips devices sql slammer worm a virus that infected millions of servers in a matter of minutes and nearly shut down the internet in january 2003 is a prime example of how attacks are now focused at the application level by exploiting characteristics of the user datagram protocol udp which allows direct transmission of data to a server sql slammer worm slipped past network security devices disguised as a simple data request once inside the application the code rewrote the server’s own instructions replicating and sending copies of itself to thousands of other servers because it was a “dayzero” attack — ie a brand new threat with no prior history — intrusion detection and prevention devices were not equipped with a signature to identify the sql slammer worm and were unable to prevent it 

in the wake of the sql slammer worm and plagued by other malicious attacks enterprises have begun to look beyond traditional security measures for solutions that can detect and shut down dayzero applicationlevel attacks under the general category of application security f5’s solutions apply a “positive” security model that contrasts with the “negative” security model used by ids and ips devices in a negative security model incoming traffic is checked against a list of signatures for known worms viruses and other security threats and if no match is found the traffic is allowed to pass in a positive security model incoming traffic is checked against a set of rules that define what specific elements are permissible in traffic headed for a particular application and rejects traffic containing anything that does not conform to the rules in the case of sql slammer worm a positive security device would have recognized that the udp packet carrying the sql slammer worm was not a simple data request and blocked the transmission 

although products that incorporate a positive security model have been around for many years they have been inherently slow and this has limited their use to enterprises that have historically placed a high priority on security now that applicationlevel attacks threaten to paralyze global business there is growing demand among enterprises for application security that can ward off these attacks the challenge is to deliver products that apply a positive security model to application traffic without slowing network performance 

since most large enterprises have hundreds — if not thousands — of servers and applications it is not practical to build functions that optimize the performance availability and security of applications into the applications themselves even if it were maintenance costs would be prohibitive and the net result would be a negative impact on the overall performance of servers and applications deploying point solutions in the network eliminates those problems but creates a new set of challenges using point solutions from multiple vendors can create interoperability issues and problems that do occur can be difficult to troubleshoot from a security standpoint it is also much more difficult to audit traffic passing through multiple devices as a result enterprise customers are 

demanding products that integrate the growing number of layer 7 application traffic management and security functions on a single platform in the past we have referred to these functions collectively as “application traffic management” however as the scope and complexity of functions performed at layer 7 has increased we believe the term “application delivery networking” is more apt to describe the components of our addressable market which include application security application optimization and application availability 

the f5 solution 

we are a leading provider of application delivery networking products that ensure the security optimization and availability of applications for any user anywhere we believe our products offer the most intelligent architecture and advanced functionality in the marketplace along with performance flexibility and usability features that help organizations improve the way they serve their employees customers and partners while lowering operational costs 

  software based products from inception we have been committed to the belief that the complexity of layer 7 application delivery networking requires a softwarebased rather than a hardwarebased solution we believe our modular software architecture enables us to deliver the broadest range of integrated functionality in the market and facilitates the addition and integration of new functionality we also believe that integrating our software with commodity hardware components enables us to build products that deliver superior performance functionality and flexibility at competitive prices 

  full proxy architecture the core of our software technology is the traffic management operating system tmos introduced in september 2004 as part of bigip version 9 we believe this is a major enhancement of our previous technology that enables bigip version 9 to deliver functionality that is superior on many levels to any other application delivery networking product in the market with tmos bigip version 9 employs a full proxy architecture that enables it to inspect modify and direct both inbound and outbound traffic flows across multiple packets this ability to manage application traffic to and from servers enables bigip version 9 to direct optimize and secure that traffic in ways that are not possible with other application delivery networking solutions 

  modular functionality in addition to its full proxy architecture tmos is specifically designed to facilitate the development and integration of application delivery networking functions as modules that can be added to bigip’s core functionality to keep pace with rapidly evolving customer needs addon modules currently available with bigip version 9 include intelligent compression ssl acceleration layer 7 rate shaping advanced client authentication ipv6 gateway caching and others recently we also began shipping trafficshield our application firewall as a software module on bigip and we are currently betatesting global traffic manager gtm and link controller modules on bigip systems at customer sites 

  application awareness the open architecture of tmos includes an application programming interface api called icontrol that allows our products to communicate with one another and with thirdparty software and devices through this unique feature thirdparty applications and network devices can take an active role in shaping ip network traffic directing traffic based on exact business requirements defined by our customers and solutions partners and tailored to specific applications this “application awareness” capability is one of the most important features of our softwarebased products and further differentiates our solutions from those of our competitors 

  adaptive intelligence the fullproxy capabilities of tmos enable it to inspect or “read” the entire contents of a transmission across multiple packets and identify specific elements of that transmission including items such as names dates and any type of number or label using our industry standard tool command language tcl scripting capability customers can use those elements as variables to create irules that modify the content and direct the flow of traffic in ways tailored to the dynamic needs of their applications 

  integrated layer 7 solutions the combination of our full proxy architecture and enhanced irules enables bigip to intercept inspect and act on the contents of traffic from virtually every type of ipenabled application in addition the modularity of the tmos architecture allows us to deliver tightly integrated solutions that secure optimize and ensure the availability of applications and the networks they run on 

our trafficshield application firewall which we acquired in 2004 was originally designed to run on a full proxy architecture and has recently been ported to tmos using the full proxy capabilities of tmos trafficshield inspects the contents of a transmission and applies a positive security model to identify and neutralize embedded security threats by comparing the contents with rules that define permissible content for specific applications this has enabled us to integrate the application security functions of trafficshield

with the security and networking features built into tmos and with the application optimization and availability functions that run on top of tmos as a result of this integration trafficshield can run as a standalone product or as a software module on bigip 

like trafficshield our firepass sslvpn products incorporate a full proxy architecture to provide secure remote access to corporate networks incoming requests for access to the network are terminated at the device where the user is authenticated and authorized to access specific applications before the traffic is sent on to the servers that host those applications once the connection is established access is only permitted to those applications for which a user is authorized and all traffic between the user and the applications is encrypted and audited we plan to port the firepass software to tmos following the release of our nextgeneration hardware platform firepass is currently integrated with our other products primarily through icontrol 

during the next 12 months we also plan to port the application acceleration and wan optimization technology we recently acquired from swan labs to tmos and integrate it with our other products 

strategy 

our objective is to lead the industry in delivering the enabling architecture that integrates the network with the applications this allows organizations to significantly improve costly and time consuming business processes and provide new sources of revenue through highly differentiated offerings key components of our strategy include 

  offering a complete application security solution and product set we plan to utilize the core technologies from our bigip firepass and trafficshield products to deliver standalone and integrated systems that protect applications from hostile and inadvertent threats including usertosystem application security and systemtosystem application security problems we believe these solutions will differentiate our products in the security market and provide a unique solution to the problem of vulnerability of missioncritical applications 

  investing in technology to continue to meet customer needs we will continue to invest in research and development to provide our customers with comprehensive integrated application traffic management and security solutions our product development efforts will continue to leverage the unique attributes of our softwarebased platforms to deliver new features and functions that address the complex and changing needs of our customers we will continue to use commodity hardware in order to ensure performance and cost competitiveness 

  enhancing the existing channel model we are investing significant resources in order to further develop our indirect sales channels we plan to expand our indirect sales channels through leading industry resellers systems integrators internet service providers and other channel partners we are also recruiting new channel partners and leveraging our existing channels to sell our new security products 

  continuing to build and expand relationships with strategic icontrol partners we plan to capitalize on our strategic relationships with enterprise software vendors who have created interfaces to our products through our icontrol application programming interface these vendors provide us significant leverage in the selling process because they recommend our products to their customers in order to differentiate ourselves further from our competitors we plan to explore opportunities to further embed icontrol into existing and new third party products and to jointly market and sell our solutions to enterprise customers with these key partners 

  enhancing our brand we plan to continue building brand awareness that positions us as one of the leading providers of application delivery networking solutions our goal is to make the f5 brand to be synonymous with superior technology highquality customer service and ease of use 

products 

our core technology is software for application delivery networking including application security and secure remote access our products are systems that integrate our software with hardware that is built using a combination of commodity components and our own custom asic for layer 4 processing our current offerings include three product families bigip firepass and trafficshield in addition we recently acquired two new application optimization products—wanjet and webacceleratorwith the purchase of swan labs 

bigip 

our family of bigip local traffic managers includes both ip application switches and server appliances members of the bigip family differ primarily in the hardware configurations that make up each system our current product family includes four application switches highend bigip 6800 and 6400 midrange bigip 3400 and an entrylevel bigip 1500 in addition to cpus for layer 7 processing all but the entrylevel systems come equipped with our own proprietary asic for highperformance layer 4 processing a commodity layer 23 switch for connectivity and commodity asics for ssl encryption and decryption and compression the bigip 520 and 540 server appliances are equipped with cpus for highspeed layer 47 processing and are designed to accommodate easilyinstalled upgrade cards that provide fast integrated ssl encryption and decryption 

other products in our bigip systems family include bigip global traffic manager formerly called 3dns controller bigip isp traffic manager formerly called link controller and application accelerator introduced in fy05 bigip global traffic manager allows enterprises with geographically dispersed data centers to direct traffic to a particular data center in accordance with customized business rules or to redirect traffic to an available data center if one of their sites becomes overloaded or is shut down for any reason bigip isp traffic manager allows enterprises with more than one internet service provider to manage the use of their available bandwidth to minimize costs while ensuring the highest quality of service application accelerator speeds up the performance and improves the bandwidth utilization of ipbased applications running over wide area networks all three products can be purchased separately as standalone systems or bundled with bigip local traffic manager on a single system 

firepass 

our firepass systems provide ssl vpn access for remote users of ip networks and any applications connected to those networks from any standard web browser on any device the components of firepass include a dynamic policy engine which manages user authentication and authorization privileges and special components that enable corporations to give remote users controlled access to the full array of applications and resources within the network 

our firepass line of ssl vpn servers currently includes the firepass 1000 and the firepass 4100 which support 100 and 2000 concurrent users respectively both support the complete range of firepass software features and offer a comprehensive solution for secure remote access to corporate applications firepass 1000 and 4100 are designed to support medium to large businesses 

trafficshield 

trafficshield is a web application firewall that provides comprehensive proactive applicationlayer protection against both generalized and targeted attacks trafficshield employs a positive security model ‘deny all unless allowed’ to permit only valid and authorized application transactions as a result trafficshield can prevent “dayzero” attacks and other types of security threats that pass through traditional firewalls and signaturebased devices such as intrusion detection and intrusion prevention systems trafficshield is available as both a standalone system and as an addon software module for our bigip product family 

wanjet 

wanjet acquired with the purchase of swan labs on october 4 2005 combines wan optimization and traffic shaping in a single device to accelerate file transfers email data replication and other applications over ip networks it provides lanlike performance on any wan ensuring predictable application performance for all users and encrypts and secures all transfers without performance penalties wanjet is deployed as dualsided symmetric solution that optimizes application traffic to and from data centers and branch offices 

webaccelerator 

webaccelerator also acquired through our purchase of swan labs speeds web transactions endtoend by optimizing individual network object requests connections and endtoend transactions from the browser through to databases installed singlesided asymmetric in the data center or dualsided symmetric in the data center and in branch locations webaccelerator enhances web application performance from any location speeding up interactive performance improving download times utilizing bandwidth more efficiently and dramatically reducing the cost and improving the response time of delivering webenabled applications to the distributed users 

currently both wanjet and webaccelerator run on swan labs’ sl400 hardware platform in the data center and sl 200 platforms in branch locations over the next 12 to 18 months we plan to port both wanjet and webaccelerator software to run on tmos and our standard f5 hardware platforms and to integrate their technology with our other products 

enabling technologies 

our application delivery networking products come equipped with icontrol and icontrol services manager functions which are designed to facilitate the broader use of our products icontrol allows customers and independent software vendors to modify their programs to communicate with our products eliminating the need for human involvement lowering the cost of performing basic network functions and reducing the likelihood of error although we do not derive revenue from icontrol itself the sale of icontrolenabled applications by independent software vendors such as microsoft and oracle helps promote and often leads directly to the sale of our other products 

icontrol services manager takes advantage of icontrol to provide a single centralized management and operational interface for our devices this feature allows customers with dozens or hundreds of our products to upgrade or modify the software on those products simultaneously from a single console this lowers the cost and simplifies the task of deploying managing and maintaining our products and reduces the likelihood of error when blanket changes are implemented 

product development 

we believe our future success depends on our ability to maintain technology leadership by constantly improving our products and by developing new products to meet the changing needs of our customers our product development group employs a standard process for the development documentation and quality control of software and systems that is designed to meet these goals this process includes working with management product marketing customers and partners to identify new or improved solutions that meet the evolving needs of our addressable markets 

our principal software engineering group is located in our headquarters in seattle washington our core firepass product development team is located in san jose california our core trafficshield product development team is located in tel aviv israel our hardware engineering group is located in spokane washington the primary product development facility for wanjet and webaccelerator is in san jose california there is also a smaller development facility for these products in belfast northern ireland members of these teams collaborate closely with one another to ensure the interoperability and performance of our hardware and software systems in fiscal 2006 we plan to relocate our san jose development teams to a single facility 

during the fiscal years ended september 30 2005 2004 and 2003 we had research and product development expenses of 315 million 244 million and 195 million respectively 

customers 

our customers include a wide variety of enterprise customers fortune 1000 or business week global 1000 companies including those in telecommunications financial services technology manufacturing transportation and government in fiscal year 2005 international sales represented 405 of our net revenues refer to note 10 of our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding our revenues by geographic area 

consistent with our goal of building a strong channel sales model the majority of our revenue is generated by sales through our distributors and valueadded resellers for fiscal year 2005 sales to ingram micro inc one of our distributors represented 186 of our revenues our agreement with ingram micro is a standard nonexclusive distribution agreement that renews automatically on an annual basis and is terminable by either party with 30 days’ prior written notice the agreement grants ingram micro the right to distribute our products to resellers in north america and certain other territories internationally with no minimum purchase requirements 

sales and marketing 

sales 

we sell our products and services to large enterprise customers through a variety of channels including distributors valueadded resellers and systems integrators a substantial amount of our revenue for fiscal year 2005 was derived from these channel sales we also sell our products and services to major accounts through our own direct sales force our agreements with our channel partners are not exclusive and do not prevent them from selling competitive products these agreements typically have terms of one year with no obligation to renew and typically do not provide for exclusive sales territories or minimum purchase requirements 

  direct sales our field sales personnel are located in major cities throughout the americas europe the middle east and africa emea japan and the asia pacific region the inside sales team generates and qualifies leads for regional sales managers and helps manage accounts by serving as a liaison between the field and internal corporate resources we sell our products directly to a limited group of customers primarily large enterprise endusers whose accounts are managed by our major account services team field systems engineers also support our regional sales managers and channel partners by participating in joint sales calls and providing presale technical resources as needed 

  distributor and valueadded reseller relationships we have established relationships with large national and international distributors local and specialized distributors and valueadded resellers from which we derive the majority of our sales the distributors sell our products and the valueadded resellers not only sell our products but also assist their customers in network design installation and testing our field sales personnel will work closely with our channel partners to assist them if necessary in the selling of our products to their customers 

  systems integrators we also market our products through strategic relationships we have with systems integrators systems integrators leverage products like ours as a core component of application or networkbased solutions that they deploy for their customers in most cases systems integrators do not directly purchase our products for resale to their customers instead they typically recommend our products as part of a broader solution an example of this approach would be packaged enterprise resource platform erp or customer relationship management crm solutions delivered by systems integrators where our traffic management products provide high availability and increased performance for the erp or crm applications 

marketing 

there are two primary aspects to our marketing strategy first we believe our future success depends on our ability to understand and anticipate the dynamic needs of our addressable markets and that we develop valuable solutions to address those needs our marketing organization works directly with customers partners and our product development teams to identify and create innovative solutions to further enhance our leadership position the second aspect is to continue to build upon our icontrol strategy we have established relationships with various independent software vendors who have adapted their applications to interact with our products via the icontrol interface icontrol enhances the functionality of third party applications by enabling them to control the network in an automated way based on business policies and rules associated with the application as a result customers who purchase icontrolenabled applications have an incentive to purchase our products in order to take advantage of the enhanced functionality made possible through our technical cooperation we also offer an online community website called devcentral that provides technical resources to customers prospects and partners wanting to extend and optimize f5 solutions using icontrol to meet their specific needs 

we also engage in a number of marketing programs and initiatives aimed at promoting our brand and creating market awareness of our technology and products these include actively participating in industry trade shows and briefing industry analysts and members of the trade press on our latest products and on new business and technology partnerships in addition we market our products to chief information officers and other information technology professionals through targeted advertising direct mail and high profile web events

at the end of fiscal years 2005 and 2004 we had product backlog of approximately 117 million and 106 million respectively backlog represents orders confirmed with a purchase order for products to be shipped generally within 90 days to customers with approved credit status orders are subject to cancellation rescheduling by customers or product specification changes by the customers although we believe that the backlog orders are firm purchase orders may be cancelled by the customer prior to shipment without significant penalty for this reason we believe that our product backlog at any given date is not a reliable indicator of future revenues 

customer service and technical support 

we believe that our ability to provide consistent highquality customer service and technical support is a key factor in attracting and retaining large enterprise customers accordingly we offer a broad range of support services that include installation phone support hardware repair and replacement software updates consulting and training services we deliver these services directly to end users and also utilize a multitiered support model leveraging the capabilities of our channel partners when applicable our technical support staff is strategically located in regional service centers to support our global customer base 

prior to the installation of our products our services personnel work with customers to analyze their network needs and determine the best way to deploy our products and configure product features and functions to meet those needs our services personnel also provide onsite installation and training services to help customers make optimal use of product features and functions 

our customers typically purchase a oneyear maintenance contract which entitles them to an array of services provided by our technical support team maintenance services provided under the contract include online updates software error correction releases hardware repair and replacement and remote support through a 24 hours a day 7 days a week help desk although not all service contracts entitle a customer to roundtheclock call center support updates to our software are only available to customers with a current maintenance contract our technical support team also offers seminars and training classes for customers on the configuration and use of products including local and wide area network system administration and management in addition we have a professional services team able to provide a full range of feebased consulting services including comprehensive network management documentation and performance analysis and capacity planning to assist in predicting future network requirements 

we also offer as part of our maintenance service an online automated selfhelp customer support function called ask f5 that allows customers to answer many commonly asked questions without having to call our support desk this allows the customer to rapidly address issues and questions while significantly reducing the number of calls to our support desk this enables us to provide comprehensive customer support while keeping our supportrelated expenses at a manageable consistent level 

manufacturing 

we outsource the manufacturing of our preconfigured hardware platforms to contract manufacturers primarily solectron corporation for assembly according to our specifications the contract manufacturers install our software onto the hardware platforms and conduct functionality testing quality assurance and documentation control prior to shipping our products our agreement with solectron allows them to procure component inventory on our behalf based upon a rolling production forecast subcontractors supply solectron with standard parts and components for our products based on our production forecast we are contractually obligated to purchase component inventory that our contract manufacturer procures in accordance with the forecast unless we give notice of order cancellation in advance of applicable lead times as protection against component shortages and to provide replacement parts for our service teams we also stock limited supplies of certain key components for our products 

hardware platforms for our products consist primarily of commodity parts and certain custom components designed and approved by our hardware engineering group most of our components are purchased from sources which we believe are readily available from other suppliers however several components used in the assembly of our products are purchased from single or limited sources such as our proprietary layer 4 asic that is manufactured for us by a third party contract semiconductor foundry 

competition 

as the increasing breadth of our product offerings has enabled us to address a broader array of opportunities within the overall application delivery networking market our competition has become more numerous and more diverse our principal competitor in the traffic management market is cisco systems inc other competitors in this market include nortel networks corporation juniper networks inc which acquired redline networks inc citrix systems inc which acquired netscaler foundry networks inc and radware ltd in the adjacent wan optimization and application acceleration markets we compete mainly with juniper which recently acquired peribit systems cisco which recently acquired fineground and increasingly packeteer inc 

in the ssl vpn market we compete with juniper citrix aventail corporation nokia nortel and symantec and a number of smaller players because ssl vpns are a potential replacement for ipsec vpns the most widely deployed solution for secure remote access today we also compete with check point software technologies ltd which along with juniper are the market leaders in ipsec vpns 

application firewalls represent an emerging market opportunity that is populated mainly by private earlydevelopmentstage companies one of these companies teros inc was recently acquired by citrix systems as we enter this market with our trafficshield products we anticipate that we will also encounter competition from vendors of traditional firewalls and other types of security devices many of which are larger and betterknown vendors than we are 

some of our competitors have a longer operating history and greater financial technical marketing and other resources than we do these larger competitors also have a more extensive customer base and broader customer relationships including relationships 

with many of our current and potential customers in addition many have large wellestablished worldwide customer support and professional services organizations and a more extensive direct sales force and sales channels because of our relatively smaller size market presence and resources our larger competitors may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements there is also the possibility that these companies may adopt aggressive pricing policies to gain market share as a result our competitors could undermine our ability to win new customers and maintain our existing customer base 

intellectual property 

we rely on a combination of patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights we have obtained three patents in the united states and have applications pending for various aspects of our technology our future success depends in part on our ability to protect our proprietary rights to the technologies used in our principal products despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use trade secrets or other information that we regard as proprietary in addition the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights as fully as do the laws of the united states we cannot assure you that any issued patent will preserve our proprietary position or that competitors or others will not develop technologies similar to or superior to our technology our failure to enforce and protect our intellectual property rights could harm our business operating results and financial condition 

in addition to our own proprietary software we incorporate software licensed from several thirdparty sources into our products these licenses generally renew automatically on an annual basis we believe that alternative technologies for this licensed software are available both domestically and internationally 

employees 

as of september 30 2005 we employed 792 fulltime persons including 217 in product development 331 in sales and marketing 147 in professional services and technical support and 97 in finance administration and operations none of our employees are represented by a labor union we have experienced no work stoppages and believe that our employee relations are good

 item 3 legal proceedings 

in july and august 2001 a series of putative securities class action lawsuits were filed in united states district court southern district of new york against certain investment banking firms that underwrote the company’s initial and secondary public offerings the company and some of the company’s officers and directors these cases which have been consolidated under in re f5 networks inc initial public offering securities litigation no 01 cv 7055 assert that the registration statements for the company’s june 4 1999 initial public offering and september 30 1999 secondary offering failed to disclose certain alleged improper actions by the underwriters for the offerings the consolidated amended complaint alleges claims against the company and those of our officers and directors named in the complaint under sections 11 and 15 of the securities act of 1933 and under sections 10b and 20a of the securities exchange act of 1934 other lawsuits have been filed making similar allegations regarding the public offerings of more than 300 other companies all of these various consolidated cases have been coordinated for pretrial purposes as in re initial public offering securities litigation civil action no 21mc92 in october 2002 the directors and officers were dismissed without prejudice the issuer defendants filed a coordinated motion to dismiss these lawsuits in july 2002 which the court granted in part and denied in part in an order dated february 19 2003 the court declined to dismiss the section 11 and section 10b and rule 10b5 claims against the company in june 2004 a stipulation of settlement for the claims against the issuer defendants including the company was submitted to the court on august 31 2005 the court granted preliminary approval of the settlement the settlement is subject to a number of conditions including final approval by the court if the settlement does not occur and litigation against us continues we believe we have meritorious defenses and intend to defend the case vigorously securities class action litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention and resources due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of the litigation and any unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and operating results 

as of september 30 2005 we were not aware of any additional pending legal proceedings that individually or in the aggregate would have had a material adverse effect on the company’s business operating results or financial condition we may in the future be party to litigation arising in the ordinary course of business including claims that we allegedly infringe upon thirdparty trademarks or other intellectual property rights such claims even if not meritorious could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources

restatement of consolidated financial statements special committee and company findings internal controls remedial measures and related proceedings 

restatement of consolidated financial statements 

on may 16 2006 the center for financial research and analysis “cfra” issued a report entitled “options backdating which companies are at risk” the “cfra report” in which cfra reviewed the option prices of 100 public companies and based upon an analysis of the exercise prices of option grants with reference to the companies’ stock prices concluded that 17 of the subject companies were in cfra’s view “at risk for having backdated option grants during the period 1997 to 2002” we were among the 17 companies so identified 

on may 18 2006 we were contacted by the securities and exchange commission “sec” as part of an informal inquiry entitled in the matter of f5 networks inc sec file no mho10462 on may 19 2006 we received a grand jury subpoena issued by the us district court for the eastern district of new york requesting documents related to the granting of stock options from 1995 through the present in connection with an inquiry into our stock option practices by the united states attorney’s office for the eastern district of new york the “department of justice” we produced documents in response to these requests and are continuing to cooperate fully with the sec regarding these inquiries 

on may 22 2006 our board of directors formed a special committee of outside directors with broad authority to conduct a review of our stock option practices including a review of our underlying stock option documentation and procedures the “special committee” the special committee was originally composed of three members of our board of directors one of which was also on the audit committee karl guelich rich malone and gary ames in july 2006 the special committee was reconstituted to consist of two independent members of our board of directors gary ames and deborah bevier who joined our board of directors on july 14 2006 the special committee retained the law firm of wilson sonsini goodrich  rosati pc “wilson sonsini” as its independent outside legal counsel wilson sonsini engaged deloitte financial advisory services llp as independent accounting experts to aid in its investigation 

in the course of responding to the sec and the department of justice’s inquiries we determined that there were potential problems with the accounting treatment of certain stock option grants on july 20 2006 we announced that the audit committee of our board of directors the “audit committee” had determined after consultation with management that our financial statements and all earnings releases and similar communications relating to fiscal periods beginning on or after october 1 2000 the first day of our fiscal year 2001 should be restated 

in october 2006 the special committee determined that the recorded grant dates for certain stock options granted during fiscal years 1999 through 2004 should not be relied upon as the measurement date for accounting purposes and that the accounting treatment used for the vesting of certain stock options was incorrect because the prices at the originally stated grant dates were lower than the prices on the actual dates of determination we determined we should have recognized material amounts of stockbased compensation expense which were not previously accounted for in our previously issued financial statements therefore the audit committee after consultation with management concluded that our previously filed unaudited interim and audited financial statement for the years ended september 30 2005 2004 2003 2002 2001 2000 and 1999 as well as the unaudited interim financial statements for the quarters ended december 31 2005 and march 31 2006 should be restated because these financial statements contained material misstatements 

special committee and company findings 

on november 8 2006 we announced that the special committee had completed its review of our stock option practices and reported its final findings to our board of directors 

the special committee concluded that there were options grants where the company i used improper measurement dates in connection with certain annual stock option grants to employees because the number of shares certain individual employees were entitled to receive was not determined until after the original grant date ii granted options to certain new employees and board members prior to their start dates iii did not have sufficient documentation to support certain measurement dates and did not obtain the necessary approvals for stock options issued to certain individuals iv did not properly account for stock option grants issued to a consultant who later became an employee and v did not properly account for stock options of certain individuals that were modified after the grant date based on its investigation the special committee concluded that it continued to have confidence in the ability of the company’s current senior management to serve in their positions with integrity at the company the special committee was unable to reach any conclusions regarding the intent of former officers directors and employees based on the special committee’s findings the company has adopted and is implementing a number of remedial measures designed to improve its policies controls processes and procedures relating to the granting and modification of stockbased compensation and will provide additional training for personnel responsible for administration of the company’s equity compensation plans 

as a result of the special committee’s investigation as well as our internal review of our stock option practices and historical financial statements we have determined the following 

 

as a result of the above we have recorded additional noncash stockbased compensation expense of approximately 241 million on stock option grants made from 1999 through 2004 in addition we recorded approximately 17 million of additional compensation expense in 2005 related to our obligation under preexisting commitments to reimburse employees for penalties incurred resulting from receipt of inthemoney option grants tax impacts of these additional expenses included a reclassification of windfall tax benefits of 48 million which were previously recognized in paidincapital and now are required to be recognized as a tax benefit and additional tax expenses in fiscal year 2004 resulting from nondeductible employee compensation of 25 million which together result in a net benefit of 23 million 

as a result of these findings our restated consolidated financial statements reflect a decrease in net income of approximately 235 million for the periods 1999 through 2005 these charges had no impact on our reported net sales or cash and cash equivalents 

the cumulative effect of the restatement adjustments on our consolidated balance sheet at september 30 2005 resulted in a decrease in retained earnings of 235 million partially offset by an increase in additional paidin capital of 195 million which results in a net decrease in total shareholders’ equity of 40 million all the restatements of financial statements financial data and related disclosures described in these consolidated financial statements are collectively referred to elsewhere in these consolidated financial statements at the “restatement” 

for explanatory purposes we have classified the stockbased compensation and other adjustments that were affected by the restatement into the aforementioned categories as presented below the classified amounts involve certain subjective judgments by management to the extent particular stock option related accounting errors may fall within more than one category to avoid double counting the adjustment amounts between categories eg a stock option that is subject to date changes andor combined with expenses resulting from consulting transition or advisory roles as such the table below should be considered a reasonable representation of the magnitude of expenses in each category 

 

internal controls 

based on the definition of “material weakness” in the public company accounting oversight board’s auditing standard no 2 an audit of internal control over financial reporting performed in conjunction with an audit of financial statements the restatement of financial statements in prior filings with the sec is a strong indicator of the existence of a “material weakness” in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting based on this definition management has concluded the issues identified above resulted in a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting for stockbased compensation as of september 30 2005 and has disclosed this to the audit committee and to our independent registered public accountants a further discussion of this material weakness as well as management’s remedial measures regarding this material weakness is set forth in part ii item 9a 

remedial measures 

in connection with the conclusion of its review the special committee recommended that our board of directors and its compensation and audit committees consider and adopt certain remedial measures related to the issues raised in the special committee’s investigation including 

 

 

in addition at the recommendation of the special committee we have identified and hired an interim general counsel to replace our previous general counsel who has tendered her resignation 

management along with our board of directors has implemented or is in the process of implementing such remedial measures 

related proceedings 

  internal revenue service audit we received a notice from the internal revenue service the “irs” indicating the irs would be auditing our tax returns for the 2002 2003 and 2004 we have produced documents and other information to the irs and are currently in discussions with the irs to resolve all issues arising from this audit we do not believe this audit and any settlement with the irs will have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

  derivative suits on may 24 2006 a shareholder action captioned adams v amdahl et al was filed against certain of our current and former officers and directors in the king county superior court in washington the complaint generally alleges that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties to us in connection with the granting of certain stock options five additional shareholder derivative complaints based on substantially the same allegations were subsequently filed in the washington federal and state courts although litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties we do not believe the results of these pending actions will individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

  nasdaq delisting  on july 20 2006 we announced that it would be unlikely that the special committee’s review would be completed in time for us to file our form 10q for the quarter ended june 30 2006 by the sec’s deadline of august 14 2006 in august 2006 we failed to timely file our form 10q for the period ended june 30 2006 as a result of the ongoing special committee investigation on august 14 2006 we received a written staff determination notice from nasdaq stating that we are not in compliance with nasdaq’s marketplace rule 4310c14 because we have not timely filed our quarterly report on form 10q for the quarter ended june 30 2006 and that therefore our securities are subject to delisting on august 18 2006 we appealed nasdaq’s staff’s delisting determination to the panel and requested an oral hearing before the panel on august 23 2006 nasdaq’s staff stayed the delisting action pending a final written decision on our appeal by the panel a hearing before the panel occurred on september 22 2006 on november 28 2006 we received notice that the panel had granted our request for continued listing on the nasdaq stock market subject to certain conditions we expect to satisfy within the time period requested by the panel 

there is no assurance that we will not be subject to inquiries related to our stock option grant practices by other federal state or foreign regulatory agencies

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements 

  revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with the guidance provided under statement of position sop no 972 “software revenue recognition” and sop no 989 “modification of sop no 972 software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions” statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 48 “revenue recognition when right of return exists” and sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 101 “revenue recognition in financial statements” and sab no 104 “revenue recognition” 

we sell products through distributors resellers and directly to end users we recognize product revenue upon shipment net of estimated returns provided that collection is determined to be probable and no significant obligations remain in certain regions where we do not have the ability to reasonably estimate returns revenue is recognized upon sale to the end user in this situation we receive a sales report from the channel partner to determine when the sales transaction to the end user has occurred payment terms to domestic customers are generally net 30 days payment terms to international customers range from net 30 to 90 days based on normal and customary trade practices in the individual markets we have offered extended payment terms ranging from three to six months to certain customers in which case revenue is recognized when payments are made 

whenever a software license hardware installation and postcontract customer support pcs elements are combined into a package with a single “bundled” price a portion of the sales price is allocated to each element of the bundled package based on their respective fair values as determined when the individual elements are sold separately revenues from the license of software are recognized when the software has been shipped and the customer is obligated to pay for the software when rights of return are present and we cannot estimate returns we recognize revenue when such rights of return lapse revenues for pcs are recognized on a straightline basis over the service contract term pcs includes rights to upgrades when and if available a limited period of telephone support updates and bug fixes installation revenue is recognized when the product has been installed at the customer’s site consulting services are customarily billed at fixed rates plus outofpocket expenses and revenues are recognized when the consulting has been completed training revenue is recognized when the training has been completed 

  reserve for doubtful accounts estimates are used in determining our allowance for doubtful accounts and are based upon an assessment of selected accounts and as a percentage of our remaining accounts receivable by aging category in determining these percentages we evaluate historical writeoffs current trends in the credit quality of our customer base as well as changes in the credit policies we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition and do not require any collateral if there is deterioration of a major customer’s credit worthiness or actual defaults are higher than our historical experience our allowance for doubtful accounts may not be sufficient 

  reserve for product returns in some instances product revenue from distributors is subject to agreements allowing rights of return product returns are estimated based on historical experience and are recorded at the time revenues are recognized accordingly we reduce recognized revenue for estimated future returns at the time revenue is recorded when rights of return are present and we cannot estimate returns revenue is recognized when such rights lapse the estimates for returns are adjusted periodically based upon changes in historical rates of returns inventory in the distribution channel and other related factors it is possible that these estimates will change in the future or that the actual amounts could vary from our estimates 

  reserve for warranties a warranty reserve is established based on our historical experience and an estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date while we believe that our warranty reserve is adequate and that the judgment applied is appropriate such amounts estimated to be due and payable could differ materially from what will actually transpire in the future 

  accounting for income taxes we utilize the liability method of accounting for income taxes as set forth by statement of financial accounting standards no 109 “accounting for income taxes” or sfas 109 accordingly we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure including assessing the risks associated with tax audits together with assessing temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities due to the evolving nature and complexity of tax rules combined with the large number of jurisdictions in which we operate it is possible that our estimates of our tax liability could change in the future which may result in additional tax liabilities and adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

  stockbased compensation we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of financial accounting standards board “fasb” statement no 123r sharebased payment  “fas 123r” on july 1 2005 and as a result recognized 46 million of expense related to stockbased compensation charges included in operating expenses in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 prior to july 1 2005 we accounted for sharebased payments under the recognition and measurement provisions of apb opinion no 25 accounting for stock issued to employees and related interpretations as permitted by fasb statement no 123 accounting for stockbased compensation  in accordance with apb 25 no compensation cost was required to be recognized for options granted that had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 

we adopted fas 123r using the modifiedprospectivetransition method under that transition method compensation cost recognized in the fiscal year 2005 includes a compensation cost for all sharebased payments granted prior to but not yet vested as 

of july 1 2005 based on the grantdate fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of fas 123 and b compensation cost for all sharebased payments granted subsequent to july 1 2005 based on the grantdate fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of fas 123r other than the restatement the results for the prior periods have not been restated 

effective july 1 2005 we adopted the straightline attribution method for recognizing compensation expense previously under the disclosureonly provisions of sfas 123 the company used the accelerated method of expense recognition pursuant to fasb interpretation no 28 accounting for stock appreciation rights and other variable stock option or award plans “fin 28” for all unvested options outstanding as of july 1 2005 the previously measured but unrecognized compensation expense based on the fair value at the original grant date will be recognized on an accelerated basis over the remaining vesting period for sharebased payments granted subsequent to july 1 2005 compensation expense based on the fair value on the date of grant will be recognized on a straightline basis over the vesting period as of september 30 2005 there was 327 million of total unrecognized compensation cost the majority of which will be recognized ratably over the next two years going forward stock compensation expenses may increase as we issue additional equitybased awards to continue to attract and retain key employees 

in addition the company recently modified the method in which it issues incentive awards to its employees through stockbased compensation in prior years stockbased compensation consisted only of stock options beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 the company began to grant restricted stock unit awards instead of stock options the value of restricted stock units is determined using the intrinsic value method which in this case is based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock on the date of grant alternatively in determining the fair value of stock options we use the blackscholes option pricing model that employs the following key assumptions expected volatility is based on the annualized daily historical volatility of our stock price over the expected life of the option expected term of the option is based on historical employee stock option exercise behavior the vesting terms of the respective option and a contractual life of ten years our stock price volatility and option lives involve management’s best estimates at that time both of which impact the fair value of the option calculated under the blackscholes methodology and ultimately the expense that will be recognized over the life of the option 

sfas 123r also requires that we recognize compensation expense for only the portion of options or stock units that are expected to vest therefore we apply estimated forfeiture rates that are derived from historical employee termination behavior our estimated forfeiture rate in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 is 5 if the actual number of forfeitures differs from those estimated by management additional adjustments to compensation expense may be required in future periods 

results of operations 

the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

 

  net revenues total net revenues increased 644 in fiscal year 2005 from fiscal year 2004 compared to an increase of 477 in fiscal year 2004 from fiscal year 2003 the improvement was due to increased demand for our application delivery networking products and higher services revenues resulting from our increased installed base of products during fiscal year 2005 each of our primary geographic regions reported higher revenues compared to the prior year period international revenues represented 405 394 and 349 of net revenues in fiscal years 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively we expect international sales will continue to represent a significant portion of net revenues although we cannot provide assurance that international revenues as a percentage of net revenues will remain at current levels 

net product revenues increased 741 in fiscal year 2005 and 498 in fiscal year 2004 as compared to the previous fiscal year respectively the increase in fiscal 2005 was primarily due to absolute growth in the volume of product sales of our bigip product 

line as well as incremental revenues derived from sales of our firepass and trafficshield product lines sales of our bigip family of application delivery networking products represented 891 903 and 993 of total product revenues in fiscal years 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively the decrease as a percentage of total sales was due to an improvement in sales of our other products such as our firepass products which represented 97 of product revenues in fiscal year 2005 

net service revenues increased 373 in fiscal year 2005 compared to a 420 increase for fiscal year 2004 from the prior year respectively the decrease in the growth rate was due to an increase in the amount of support services provided by our channel partners the increase of services revenues in absolute dollars was the result of a growing customer base and continued growth in service renewals from existing customers 

ingram micro inc one of our domestic distributors accounted for 186 191 and 126 of our total net revenues in fiscal years 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively ingram micro accounted for 262 269 and 178 of our accounts receivable as of september 30 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively 

 

 

   cost of net product revenues cost of net product revenues consist of finished products purchased from our contract manufacturers manufacturing overhead freight warranty provisions for excess and obsolete inventory and amortization expenses in connection with developed technology from acquisitions cost of net product revenues as a percentage of net product revenues remained relatively consistent at 223 in fiscal year 2005 as compared to 225 and 212 in fiscal years 2004 and 2003 respectively the increase in absolute dollars is consistent with the increase in product revenues for the corresponding period higher indirect product costs including amortization charges of our acquired technology and warranty costs associated with the growth in overall product installation base contributed to the percentage increase as compared to fiscal year 2003 

  cost of net service revenues cost of net service revenues consist of the salaries and related benefits of our professional services staff travel facilities and depreciation expenses cost of net service revenues as a percentage of net service revenues increased to 262 in fiscal year 2005 as compared to 244 and 288 in fiscal years 2004 and 2003 respectively the increase in fiscal year 2005 is primarily due to increased salary and benefits attributed to growth in headcount professional services headcount at the end of fiscal year 2005 increased to 147 from 124 at the end of fiscal year 2004 going forward we expect to continue to increase our cost of service revenues to support our expanded product lines and growing customer base 

 

 

   sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses consist of salaries commissions and related benefits of our sales and marketing staff the costs of our marketing programs including public relations advertising and trade shows travel facilities and depreciation expenses stockbased compensation charges for awards to our sales and marketing personnel are included beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2005 the decrease in sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total net revenues is the result of leveraging our existing sales and distribution infrastructure to support the increased net revenues in absolute dollars sales and marketing expenses increased 352 in fiscal year 2005 and 210 in fiscal year 2004 as compared to the previous fiscal year respectively the increases were primarily due to higher commission and personnel costs consistent with the increased revenue and headcount for the corresponding period sales and marketing headcount at the end of fiscal 2005 increased to 331 from 229 at the end of fiscal 2004 and 211 at the end of fiscal 2003 stockbased compensation charges of 24 million contributed to the overall increase in fiscal year 2005 we expect to continue to increase sales and marketing expenses in absolute dollars in order to grow revenues and increase our market share 

  research and development research and development expenses consist of the salaries and related benefits for our product development personnel prototype materials and expenses related to the development of new and improved products facilities and depreciation expenses in absolute dollars research and development expenses increased 290 in fiscal year 2005 and 256 in fiscal year 2004 as compared to the previous fiscal year respectively the increases in fiscal years 2005 and 2004 were primarily due to higher salary and benefits costs attributed to an increase in headcount to 217 in fiscal year 2005 from 185 in fiscal year 2004 and 145 in fiscal 2003 the growth in employee headcount was primarily related to enhancement of our current products and our ability to develop new technologically advanced products that meet the changing needs of our customers stockbased compensation charges of 15 million contributed to the overall increase in fiscal year 2005 we expect to continue to increase research and development expenses as our future success is dependent on the continued development of our products 

  general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist of the salaries benefits and related costs of our executive finance information technology human resource and legal personnel thirdparty professional service fees bad debt charges facilities and depreciation expenses the decrease in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total net revenues is the result of leveraging our existing corporate infrastructure to support the increased net revenues in absolute dollars general and administrative expenses increased 617 in fiscal year 2005 and increased 291 in fiscal year 2004 as compared to the previous fiscal year respectively the increase in fiscal year 2005 is due to increased salary and benefit expenses of 26 million and higher professional service fees of 19 million the increase in personnel costs is consistent with the growth in headcount general and administrative headcount at the end of fiscal 2005 increased to 97 from 75 at the end of fiscal 2004 stockbased compensation charges of 28 million contributed to the overall increase in fiscal year 2005 the increase in general and administrative expenses is expected to remain at these increased levels as the company continues to build its infrastructure to support the worldwide growth of our business 

 

 

   other income net other income net consists of interest income and foreign currency transaction gains and losses other income net increased 1957 in fiscal year 2005 and increased 2636 in fiscal year 2004 as compared to the previous fiscal year respectively the significant increase was due to a combination of higher yields and increased investment balances the increased investment balances are the result of cash provided from operating and financing activities during the fiscal years 2005 and fiscal year 2004 net proceeds of 1136 million received from the sale of common stock in a public offering completed in november of 2003 was the most significant addition to our investment balances 

  provision for income taxes we recorded a 394 provision for income taxes for the fiscal year 2005 as of fiscal yearend 2005 we do not have a valuation allowance on any of our deferred tax assets in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate because we believe that the assets are more likely than not to be realized in making this determination we have considered projected future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the appropriateness of a valuation allowance our net deferred tax assets as of fiscal year end 2005 2004 and 2003 were 404 million 316 million and 0 respectively our world wide effective tax rate may fluctuate based on a number of factors including variations in projected taxable income in the various geographic locations in which we operate changes in the valuation of our net deferred tax assets resolution of potential exposures tax positions that are taken on returns filed in the various geographic locations in which we operate introduction of new accounting standards or changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof in any of the various geographic locations in which we operate we have recorded liabilities to address potential exposures related to business and income tax positions we have taken that could be challenged by taxing authorities the ultimate resolution of these potential exposures may be greater or less than the liabilities recorded which could result in an adjustment to our future tax expense 

in fiscal year 2004 the primary difference between the statutory tax rate and the effective tax rate was due to previously unrecognized deferred tax assets which were recognized sfas 109 provides for the recognition of deferred tax assets if realization is more likely than not based on available evidence which includes our historical operating performance and the reported cumulative net losses in all prior years we had provided for a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets at the end of fiscal year 2003 based upon our operating performance in fiscal year 2004 and projected future taxable income we determined that our us deferred tax assets were more likely than not to be realizable therefore the valuation allowance was reversed and as a result we realized an income tax benefit of 119 million the credit from the release of the valuation allowance was partially offset by actual us and international tax expenses resulting in a net benefit for income taxes of 85 million in fiscal year 2004 the provision for income taxes in fiscal year 2003 consisted primarily of taxes payable in foreign jurisdictions 

liquidity and capital resources 

we have funded our operations with our cash balances cash generated from operations and proceeds from public offerings 

 

cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and longterm investments totaled 3650 million as of september 30 2005 compared to 2223 million as of september 30 2004 representing an increase of 1427 million the increase was due to the cash flow from operations and cash from employee stock option exercises in fiscal year 2004 overall cash and investments increased 1433 million compared to the fiscal year 2003 the increase was primarily due to the net proceeds of 1136 million from the sale of 5175000 shares of common stock in a public offering completed in november 2003 

cash provided by operating activities during fiscal year 2005 was 850 million compared to 406 million in fiscal year 2004 and 146 million in fiscal year 2003 cash provided by operating activities resulted primarily from cash generated from net income after adjusting for noncash charges changes in operating assets and liabilities and an increase in advance payments from customers 

cash used in investing activities was 1268 million for the fiscal year 2005 1647 million for fiscal year 2004 and 381 million for fiscal year 2003 the cash used in the fiscal year 2005 was primarily due to the purchase of investments and property and equipment partially offset by the sale of investments the cash used in fiscal year 2004 was due to the purchase of investments primarily made possible by the proceeds of our public offering and the purchase of property and equipment and the acquisition of magnifire partially offset by the sale of investments the cash used in fiscal year 2003 was primarily the result of the cash used to acquire substantially all the assets of uroam and the purchase of investments and property and equipment partially offset by the sale of investments 

cash provided by financing activities was 689 million for fiscal year 2005 compared to 1385 million for fiscal year 2004 and 128 million for the fiscal year 2003 in fiscal years 2005 and 2003 our financing activities consisted of cash proceeds received from the exercise of stock options and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan during the fiscal year 2004 our financing activities included 1136 million of net proceeds received from a public stock offering as well as cash received from the exercise of employee stock options and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan 

we expect that our existing cash and investment balances and cash from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated working capital and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future 

obligations and commitments 

the following table summarizes our contractual payment obligations and commitments as of september 30 2005 

 

we lease our facilities under operating leases that expire at various dates through 2014 

purchase obligations are comprised of purchase commitments with our contract manufacturers the agreement with our primary contract manufacturer allows them to procure component inventory on our behalf based on our production forecast we are obligated to purchase component inventory that the contract manufacturer procures in accordance with the forecast unless cancellation is given within applicable lead times 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in march 2004 the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on issue no 031 “the meaning of otherthantemporary impairment and its application to certain investments” eitf 031 provides guidance on otherthantemporary impairment models for marketable debt and equity securities accounted for under sfas no 115 “accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities” and sfas no 124 “accounting for certain investments held by notforprofit organizations” and nonmarketable equity securities accounted for under the cost method the eitf developed a basic threestep model to evaluate whether an investment is otherthantemporarily impaired on september 30 2004 the fasb approved the issuance of fasb staff position fsp eitf 0311 which delays the effective date until additional guidance is issued for the application of the recognition and measurement provisions of eitf 031 to investments in securities that are impaired in november 2005 the fasb issued fsp fas 1151 and fas 1241 “the meaning of otherthantemporary impairment and its application to certain investments” this fsp addresses the determination as to when an investment is considered impaired whether the impairment is other than temporary and the measurement of an impairment loss this statement specifically nullifies the requirements of paragraph 1018 of eitf 031 and references existing otherthantemporary impairment guidance the guidance under this fsp is effective for reporting periods beginning after december 15 2005 and the company continued to apply relevant “otherthantemporary” guidance as provided for in fsp eitf 0311 during fiscal 2005 the company does not expect the adoption of fsp fas 1151 and fas 1241 to have a material effect on the company’s results of operations or financial condition 

in may of 2005 the fasb issued sfas no 154 “accounting changes and error corrections — a replacement of apb opinion no 20 and fasb statement no 3” which changes the requirements for the accounting and reporting of a change in accounting principle the statement applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle and to changes required by an accounting pronouncement in the unusual instance that the pronouncement does not include specific transition provisions this statement requires retrospective application to prior periods’ financial statements of changes in accounting principle unless it is impracticable to determine either the periodspecific effects or the cumulative effect of the change sfas no 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december 15 2005 the company does not expect the adoption of this statement to have a material impact on the company’s financial condition or results of operations 

risk factors 

in addition to the other information in this report the following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating our company and its business 

our success depends on our timely development of new products and features market acceptance of new product offerings and proper management of the timing of the life cycle of our products 

we expect the application delivery networking market to be characterized by rapid technological change frequent new product introductions changes in customer requirements and evolving industry standards our continued success depends on our ability to identify and develop new products and new features for our existing products to meet the demands of these changes and for those products and features to be accepted by our existing and target customers if we are unable to identify develop and deploy new products and new product features on a timely basis our business and results of operations may be harmed 

in september 2004 we announced the release of our nextgeneration bigip product featuring the traffic management operating system or tmos this major new version of bigip represented the culmination of over two years of research and development efforts tmos is specifically designed to facilitate the development and integration of application delivery functions as modules that can be added to bigip’s core functionality to keep pace with rapidly evolving customer needs we currently offer software modules as addons for this product and our continued success depends significantly on our ability to integrate new modules and functionality onto this platform and the acceptance of the new hardware and software platforms associated with this release by our existing and target customers 

the current life cycle of our products is typically 12 to 24 months the introduction of new products or product enhancements may shorten the life cycle of our existing products or replace sales of some of our current products thereby offsetting the benefit of even a successful product introduction and may cause customers to defer purchasing our existing products in anticipation of the new products this could harm our operating results by decreasing sales increasing our inventory levels of older products and exposing us to greater risk of product obsolescence we have also experienced and may in the future experience delays in developing and releasing new products and product enhancements this has led to and may in the future lead to delayed sales increased expenses and lower quarterly revenue than anticipated also in the development of our products we have experienced delays in the prototyping of our products which in turn has led to delays in product introductions in addition complexity and difficulties in managing product transitions at the endoflife stage of a product can create excess inventory of components associated with the outgoing product that can lead to increased expenses any or all of the above problems could materially harm our business and operating results 

our success depends on sales and continued innovation of our bigip product lines 

for the fiscal year ended september 30 2005 we derived 891 of our product revenues from sales of our bigip family of application delivery networking product lines we expect to derive a significant portion of our net revenues from sales of our bigip products in the future implementation of our strategy depends upon bigip being able to solve critical network availability and performance problems of our customers if bigip is unable to solve these problems for our customers or if we are unable to sustain the high levels of innovation in bigip’s product feature set needed to maintain leadership in what will continue to be a competitive market environment our business and results of operations will be harmed 

we may not be able to compete effectively in the emerging application delivery networking market 

the markets we serve are new rapidly evolving and highly competitive and we expect competition to persist and intensify in the future our principal competitors in the application delivery networking market include cisco systems inc nortel networks corporation foundry networks inc citrix systems inc radware ltd and juniper networks inc we expect to continue to face additional competition as new participants enter our market in addition larger companies with significant resources brand recognition and sales channels may form alliances with or acquire competing application delivery networking solutions and emerge as significant competitors potential competitors may bundle their products or incorporate an internet traffic management or security component into existing products in a manner that discourages users from purchasing our products 

our quarterly and annual operating results are volatile and may cause our stock price to fluctuate 

our quarterly and annual operating results have varied significantly in the past and will vary significantly in the future which makes it difficult for us to predict our future operating results in particular we anticipate that the size of customer orders may increase as we continue to focus on larger business accounts a delay in the recognition of revenue even from just one account may have a significant negative impact on our results of operations for a given period in the past a majority of our sales have been realized near the end of a quarter accordingly a delay in an anticipated sale past the end of a particular quarter may negatively impact our results of operations for that quarter or in some cases that year additionally we have exposure to the credit risks of some of our customers and subtenants although we have programs in place that are designed to monitor and mitigate the associated risk there can be no assurance that such programs will be effective in reducing our credit risks adequately we monitor individual payment capability in granting credit arrangements seek to limit the total credit to amounts we believe our customers can pay and maintain reserves we believe are adequate to cover exposure for potential losses if there is a deterioration of a subtenant’s or major customer’s creditworthiness or actual defaults are higher than expected future resulting losses if incurred could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

further our operating results may be below the expectations of securities analysts and investors in future quarters or years our failure to meet these expectations will likely harm the market price of our common stock 

the average selling price of our products may decrease and our costs may increase which may negatively impact gross profits 

it is possible that the average selling prices of our products will decrease in the future in response to competitive pricing pressures increased sales discounts new product introductions by us or our competitors or other factors therefore in order to maintain our gross profits we must develop and introduce new products and product enhancements on a timely basis and continually reduce our product costs our failure to do so will cause our net revenue and gross profits to decline which will harm our business and results of operations in addition we may experience substantial periodtoperiod fluctuations in future operating results due to the erosion of our average selling prices 

it is difficult to predict our future operating results because we have an unpredictable sales cycle 

our products have a lengthy sales cycle which is difficult to predict historically our sales cycle has ranged from approximately two to three months and has tended to lengthen as we have increasingly focused our sales efforts on the enterprise market also as our distribution strategy has evolved into more of a channel model utilizing valueadded resellers distributors and systems integrators the level of variability in the length of sales cycle across transactions has increased and made it more difficult to predict the timing of many of our sales transactions sales of our products require us to educate potential customers in their use and benefits sales of our products are subject to delays from the lengthy internal budgeting approval and competitive evaluation processes that large corporations and governmental entities may require for example customers frequently begin by evaluating our products on a limited basis and devote time and resources to testing our products before they decide whether or not to purchase customers may also defer orders as a result of anticipated releases of new products or enhancements by our competitors or us as a result our products have an unpredictable sales cycle that contributes to the uncertainty of our future operating results 

our business may be harmed if our contract manufacturers are not able to provide us with adequate supplies of our products or if a single source of hardware assembly is lost or impaired 

we rely on third party contract manufacturers to assemble our products we outsource the manufacturing of our hardware platforms to contract manufacturers who assemble these hardware platforms to our specifications we have experienced minor delays in shipments from contract manufacturers in the past however if we experience major delays in the future or other problems such as inferior quality and insufficient quantity of product any one or a combination of these factors may harm our business and results of operations the inability of our contract manufacturers to provide us with adequate supplies of our products or the loss of our contract manufacturer may cause a delay in our ability to fulfill orders while we obtain a replacement manufacturer and may harm our business and results of operations in particular because we subcontract substantially all of our manufacturing to a single contract manufacturer with whom we do not have a longterm contract any termination loss or impairment in our arrangement with this single source of hardware assembly or any impairment of their facilities or operations would harm our business financial condition and results of operation 

if the demand for our products grows we will need to increase our raw material and component purchases contract manufacturing capacity and internal test and quality control functions any disruptions in product flow may limit our revenue may harm our competitive position and may result in additional costs or cancellation of orders by our customers 

our business could suffer if there are any interruptions or delays in the supply of hardware components from our thirdparty sources 

we currently purchase several hardware components used in the assembly of our products from a number of single or limited sources lead times for these components vary significantly the unavailability of suitable components any interruption or delay in the supply of any of these hardware components or the inability to procure a similar component from alternate sources at acceptable prices within a reasonable time may delay assembly and sales of our products and hence our revenues and may harm our business and results of operations 

we may not adequately protect our intellectual property and our products may infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties 

we rely on a combination of patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure of confidential and proprietary information to protect our intellectual property rights despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology monitoring unauthorized use of our products is difficult and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of our technology particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 

our industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the ordinary course of our business we are involved in disputes and licensing discussions with others regarding their claimed proprietary rights and cannot assure you that we will always successfully defend ourselves against such claims if we are found to infringe the proprietary rights of others or if we otherwise settle such claims we could be compelled to pay damages or royalties and either obtain a license to those intellectual property rights or alter our products so that they no longer infringe upon such proprietary rights any license could be very expensive to obtain or may not be available at all similarly changing our products or processes to avoid infringing the rights of others may be costly or impractical in addition we have initiated and may in the future initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights to determine the scope and validity of our proprietary rights or those of our competitors any of these claims whether claims that we are infringing the proprietary rights of others or vice versa with or without merit may be timeconsuming result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel or require us to cease using infringing technology develop noninfringing technology or enter into royalty or licensing agreements further our license agreements typically require us to indemnify our customers distributors and resellers for infringement actions related to our technology which could cause us to become involved in infringement claims made against our customers distributors or resellers any of the abovedescribed circumstances relating to intellectual property rights disputes could result in our business and results of operations being harmed 

many of our products include intellectual property licensed from third parties in the future it may be necessary to renew licenses for third party intellectual property or obtain new licenses for other technology these third party licenses may not be available to us on acceptable terms if at all the inability to obtain certain licenses or litigation regarding the interpretation or enforcement of license rights and related intellectual property issues could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition furthermore we license some third party intellectual property on a nonexclusive basis and this may limit our ability to protect our intellectual property rights in our products 

we may not be able to sustain or develop new distribution relationships and a reduction or delay in sales to a significant distribution partner could hurt our business 

our sales strategy requires that we establish and maintain multiple distribution channels in the united states and internationally through leading industry resellers systems integrators internet service providers and other channel partners we have a limited number of agreements with companies in these channels and we may not be able to increase our number of distribution relationships or maintain our existing relationships if we are unable to establish or maintain our indirect sales channels our business and results of operations will be harmed in addition one domestic distributor of our products accounted for 186 and 191 of our total net revenue for the fiscal years 2005 and 2004 respectively a substantial reduction or delay in sales of our products to this or any other key distribution partner could harm our business operating results and financial condition 

undetected software errors may harm our business and results of operations 

software products frequently contain undetected errors when first introduced or as new versions are released we have experienced these errors in the past in connection with new products and product upgrades we expect that these errors will be found from time to time in new or enhanced products after commencement of commercial shipments these problems may cause us to incur significant warranty and repair costs divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts and cause significant customer relations problems we may also be subject to liability claims for damages related to product errors while we carry insurance policies covering this type of liability these policies may not provide sufficient protection should a claim be asserted a material product liability claim may harm our business and results of operations 

our products must successfully operate with products from other vendors as a result when problems occur in a network it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem the occurrence of software errors whether caused by our products or another vendor’s products may result in the delay or loss of market acceptance of our products the occurrence of any of these problems may harm our business and results of operations 

our operating results are exposed to risks associated with international commerce 

as our international sales increase our operating results become more exposed to international operating risks these risks include risks related to potential recessions in economies outside the united states foreign currency exchange rates managing foreign sales offices regulatory political or economic conditions in specific countries military conflict or terrorist activities changes in laws and tariffs inadequate protection of intellectual property rights in foreign countries foreign regulatory requirements and natural disasters all of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business we intend to continue expanding into international markets international sales represented 405 and 394 of our net revenues for the fiscal years ended september 30 2005 and 2004 respectively in particular in fiscal year 2005 we derived 137 of our total revenue from the japanese market this revenue is dependent on a number of factors outside our control including the viability and success of our resellers and the strength of the japanese economy 

changes in governmental regulations could negatively affect our revenues 

our products are subject to various regulations promulgated by the united states and various foreign governments including but not limited to environmental regulations and regulations implementing export license requirements and restrictions on the import or export of some technologies especially encryption technology changes in governmental regulation and our inability or failure to obtain required approvals permits or registrations could harm our international and domestic sales and adversely affect our revenues business and operations 

acquisitions including our recent acquisition of swan labs present many risks and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that are contemplated at the time of the transaction 

with respect to our acquisitions as well as any other future acquisitions we may undertake we may find that the acquired assets do not further our business strategy as expected or that we paid more than what the assets are later worth or that economic conditions change all of which may generate future impairment charges there may be difficulty integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired business and we may have difficulty retaining the key personnel of the acquired business we may have difficulty in incorporating the acquired technologies or products with our existing product lines our ongoing business and management’s attention may be disrupted or diverted by transition or integration issues and the complexity of managing geographically and culturally diverse locations we may have difficulty maintaining uniform standards controls procedures and policies across locations we may experience significant problems or liabilities associated with the product quality technology and other matters 

our inability to successfully operate and integrate newlyacquired businesses appropriately effectively and in a timely manner or to retain key personnel of any acquired business could have a material adverse effect on our ability to take advantage of further growth in demand for integrated traffic management and security solutions and other advances in technology as well as on our revenues gross margins and expenses 

our success depends on our key personnel and our ability to attract and retain qualified sales and marketing operations product development and professional services personnel 

our success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our key management product development sales marketing and finance personnel many of whom may be difficult to replace the complexity of our application delivery networking products and their integration into existing networks and ongoing support as well as the sophistication of our sales and marketing effort requires us to retain highly trained professional services customer support and sales personnel competition for qualified professional services customer support and sales personnel in our industry is intense because of the limited number of people available with the necessary technical skills and understanding of our products our ability to retain and hire these personnel may be adversely affected by volatility or reductions in the price of our common stock since these employees are generally granted stock options the loss of services of any of our key personnel the inability to retain and attract qualified personnel in the future or delays in hiring qualified personnel may harm our business and results of operations 

we face litigation risks 

we are a party to lawsuits in the normal course of our business litigation in general and intellectual property and securities litigation in particular can be expensive lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations moreover the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict responding to the allegations has been and will likely continue to be expensive and timeconsuming for us an unfavorable resolution of the lawsuits could adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

our historical stock option practices and the restatement of our prior financial statements have exposed us to greater risks associated with litigation in may 2006 several derivative actions were filed against certain current and former directors and officers based on allegations relating to our historical stock option practices we cannot assure you that this current litigation will result in the same conclusions reached by the special committee 

we may in the future be subject to additional litigation arising in relation to our historical stock option practices and the restatement of our prior period financial statements litigation may be time consuming expensive and distracting for management from the conduct of our business the adverse resolution of any lawsuit could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we cannot assure you that any future litigation relating to our historical stock option practices will result in the same conclusions reached by the special committee furthermore if we are subject to adverse findings in any of these matters we could be required to pay damages or penalties or have other remedies imposed upon us which could adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

the matters relating to the special committee’s review of our historical stock option practices and the restatement of our consolidated financial statements has resulted in regulatory proceedings against us and may result in future regulatory proceedings which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition 

on november 8 2006 we announced that the special committee had completed its review of our historical stock option practices upon completion of its review the special committee found that the recorded grant dates for certain stock options granted during fiscal years 1999 to 2004 should not be relied upon as the measurement date for accounting purposes and the accounting treatment used for the vesting of certain stock options was incorrect based on the special committee’s review to correct the accounting treatment we have amended the original report and our quarterly reports on form 10q for the three months ended december 31 2005 and march 31 2006 to restate the consolidated financial statements contained in those reports 

we have received notice from both the sec and the department of justice that they are conducting informal inquiries into our historical stock option practices and we have continually cooperated with both agencies considerable legal and accounting expenses related to our historical stock option practices have already been incurred to date and significant expenditures may continue to be incurred in the future we may in the future be subject to additional regulatory proceedings or actions arising in relation to our historical stock option practices and the restatement of our prior period financial statements any potential regulatory proceeding or action may be time consuming expensive and distracting for management from the conduct of our business the adverse resolution of any potential regulatory proceeding or action could adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition we cannot assure you that the sec and department of justice inquiries or any future regulatory action relating to our historical stock option practices will result in the same conclusions reached by the special committee furthermore if we are subject to adverse findings in any of these matters we could be required to pay damages or penalties or have other remedies imposed upon us including criminal penalties which could adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

as a result of our delayed filing of our form 10q for the quarter ended june 30 2006 our inability to maintain our form s3 eligibility may adversely affect our ability to raise future capital 

as a result of our delayed filing of our form 10q for the quarter ended june 30 2006 we will be ineligible to register our securities on form s3 for sale by us or resale by other security holders until we have timely filed all periodic reports under the securities exchange act of 1934 for one year from the date the form 10q for the quarter ended june 30 2006 was due in the meantime we have the ability to use form s1 to raise capital or complete acquisitions which could increase the transaction costs and adversely affect our ability to raise capital or complete acquisitions of other companies during this period 

antitakeover provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us 

our board of directors has the authority to issue up to 10000000 shares of preferred stock and to determine the price rights preferences privileges and restrictions including voting rights of those shares without any further vote or action by the stockholders the rights of the holders of common stock may be subject to and may be adversely affected by the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future the issuance of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a change of control of our company without further action by our stockholders and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of the holders of common stock further certain provisions of our bylaws including a provision limiting the ability of stockholders to raise matters at a meeting of stockholders without giving advance notice may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or management of our company which could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock in addition our articles of incorporation provide for a staggered board which may make it more difficult for a third party to gain control of our board of directors similarly state antitakeover laws in the state of washington related to corporate takeovers may prevent or delay a change of control of our company 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

  interest rate risk our cash equivalents consist of highquality securities as specified in our investment policy guidelines the policy limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue or issuer to a maximum of 5 of the total portfolio with the exception of us treasury securities commercial paper and money market funds which are exempt from size limitation the policy requires investments in securities that mature in three years or less with the average maturity being no greater than one and a half years these securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if interest rates increase a decrease of one percent in the average interest rate would have resulted in a decrease of approximately 26 million in our interest income for the fiscal year 2005 

 

  foreign currency risk the majority of our sales and expenses are denominated in us dollars and as a result we have not experienced significant foreign currency transaction gains and losses to date while we have conducted some transactions in foreign currencies during the fiscal year ended september 30 2005 and expect to continue to do so we do not anticipate that foreign currency transaction gains or losses will be significant at our current level of operations however as we continue to expand our operations internationally transaction gains or losses may become significant in the future we have not engaged in foreign currency hedging to date however we may do so in the future 




 item 9 changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure 

none 




 item 9a controls and procedures 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

the company maintains disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “exchange act” that are designed to ensure that required information is recorded processed summarized and reported within the required timeframe as specified in the rules set forth by the securities exchange commission our disclosure controls and procedures are also designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated to management including the chief executive officer and chief accounting officer to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures 

our management with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief accounting officer evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of september 30 2005 and based on this evaluation the ceo and cao had previously concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of september 30 2005 as a result of the findings of the special committee as well as our internal review of our historical stock option practices and our need to restate the 2005 2004 and 2003 annual consolidated financial statements and the interim consolidated financial statements for the first and second quarters of 2006 and all quarters of 2005 as described in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements we determined that there was a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as of september 30 2005 as more fully described below in “management’s report on internal control over financial reporting restated” for these reasons we have now concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of september 30 2005 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting restated 

management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in exchange act rules 13a15f and 15d15f internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 

internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override because of such limitations there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting however these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process therefore it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce though not eliminate this risk 

management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of september 30 2005 based on the framework established in internal control — integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission “coso” a material weakness is a control deficiency or combination of control deficiencies that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected 

management identified the following material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as of september 30 2005 

 

 

in management’s report on internal control over financial reporting included in the annual report on form 10k for the year ended september 30 2005 our management had previously concluded that we maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of september 30 2005 in connection with the restatement discussed under the heading “restatement of consolidated financial statements” in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements our management has subsequently concluded that the material weakness described above existed as of september 30 2005 as a result we have now concluded that we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of september 30 2005 based on the criteria in internal control — integrated framework issued by the coso accordingly management’s report on internal control over financial reporting has been restated 

management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of september 30 2005 has been audited by pricewaterhousecoopers llp an independent registered public accounting firm as stated in their report appearing on page 41 

remediation of material weakness 

management is committed to remediating the material weakness described above by implementing changes to our internal control over financial reporting 

on july 1 2005 we adopted the fair value recognition provision of fas 123r we also began granting restricted stock unit awards instead of stock options in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 as our primary form of stockbased compensation fas 123r requires the recognition as expense of all stockbased compensation in connection with the adoption of fas 123r we revised certain of our policies processes procedures and controls relating to grants of stockbased compensation 

although improvements were made to our internal control over financial reporting as they relate to the granting and modification of stockbased compensation in connection with the adoption of fas 123r as of september 30 2005 we had not fully remediated the material weakness describe above 

subsequent to the initiation of our investigation into our stockoption granting practices in may 2006 we considered the effectiveness of both the design and operation of our internal control over financial reporting as they relate to the granting and modification of stockbased compensation we implemented a number or significant improvements in our internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2006 in particular we developed and implemented the following policies processes procedures and controls over the granting and modification of stockbased compensation 

 

as of september 30 2006 management has implemented these additional policies procedures and controls additionally we have evaluated the design of these new controls which have been placed into operation for a sufficient period of time and tested their operating effectiveness we consider that the steps identified and implemented above have improved the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and as of september 30 2006 have remediated the material weakness described above 

on november 8 2006 we announced the special committee had completed its review of our stock option practices and reported its findings to our board of directors in connection with the conclusion of its review the special committee recommended that our board of directors and its compensation and audit committees consider and adopt certain additional remedial measures and best practices related to the issues raised in the special committees investigation we are in the process of implementing these recommendations 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

as described above there were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 that materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting

industry background 

  internet protocol ip is a communications language used to transmit data over the internet since the late 1990’s businesses have responded to the power flexibility and economy of the internet by deploying new ipbased applications upgrading their clientserver applications to new ipenabled versions and enabling existing or legacy applications for use over the internet over the next several years we believe this process will accelerate as more and more organizations discover the benefits of deploying ipenabled applications and new technologies continue to enhance the performance reliability and security of both applications and ip networks in addition we believe the growth of internet usage will continue to be driven by new applications such as web services voice over ip increased penetration of broadband internet access enabling the remote use of more applications and the increasing popularity of mobile internet access through wireless devices such as cellular telephones pdas and notebook computers 

   ip requires all data transmitted across the internet to be divided into packets at the source and reassembled at the destination the open systems interconnect osi reference model is the framework that divides network functions into seven layers and specifies how the layers should interact to enable all of a network’s different hardware and software components to work together to accomplish this process prior to transmission each packet of data is automatically given a header that identifies the source and destination of the packet this header information is used in the osi model for the purposes of identifying routing and sequencing data packets and is stripped from the data upon arrival at its destination layers 24 of the osi model perform standardized repetitive tasks such as ensuring that packets of information sent over the internet arrive at the destination to which they are addressed and are reassembled in the correct sequence consequently most layer 24 switches are hardwarebased devices that use applicationspecific integrated circuits asics and are optimized for speed unlike layers 24 layer 7 which in practice includes the functions ascribed to layers 5 and 6 in the osi model is complex and variable and must support enduser applications and processes on a wide variety of platforms and devices while most layer 4 switches rely on hardwarebased architectures to maximize throughput the demands of processing data at layer 7 increasingly require flexibility and adaptability that can be achieved only through a softwarebased solution the challenge in building highly flexible functionrich softwarebased switches for application delivery networking is to deliver these capabilities at speeds that do not slow the speed of network traffic 

   as more applications are ipenabled there is growing demand for layer 7 technology that can read the entire contents or flow of data in a packetized transmission and make intelligent decisions based on a dynamic set of business rules about how to handle the transmission to make the applications network and 

4 servers always secure fast and available basic layer 7 functions include loadbalancing distributing traffic across multiple servers while making them appear to be a single server and healthchecking monitoring the performance of servers and applications to ensure that they are working properly before routing traffic to them in addition layer 7 processing encompasses a growing number of functions that have typically been performed by the server or the application itself or by point solutions running on separate devices functions in this category include ssl acceleration — using secure socket layer ssl encryption to secure traffic between the server and the browser on an end user’s client device rate shaping — prioritizing transmissions according to preset rules that give precedence to different types of traffic compression — reducing the volume of data transmitted to take maximum advantage of available bandwidth tcp optimization — improving server efficiency by maintaining an open connection with a server during interactive sessions ipv6 translation — enabling communication and interoperability between networked devices using ipv6 the newest version of the internet protocol and those using the older version ipv4 and modifying the content of a transaction to improve security 

  in addition to optimizing the performance and availability of their networks and applications enterprises face the increasingly complex challenge of providing security for applications and data that are accessible over their ip networks layer 7 or application level security includes three basic components providing employees partners and customers with secure access to corporate applications ensuring that access is limited to those applications for which a user is specifically authorized and protecting the integrity of applications and data 

  currently the most widespread solution for secure remote access is technology that uses the ip security ipsec protocol to establish a secure virtual private network vpn between a remote device such as a user’s home pc or a laptop and the corporate network although an ipsec vpn tunnel is very secure it has a number of drawbacks one is that ipsec requires the remote device to have special software installed on it and maintaining the most current version of this software on all user devices is time consuming and costly a more serious issue is that once ipsec establishes a connection between a user and the corporate network the user has full access to any application in the network and the only way to prevent unauthorized use is to secure each application or physically segment the network as an alternative to using ipsec vpns for remote access technology that employs ssl encryption to establish a secure vpn has emerged and is making rapid inroads in the market because this technology relies on the ssl capabilities resident in any standard web browser it is not necessary to install additional software on the remote device this makes it possible to access the network from a cell phone pda kiosk laptop pc or any other device with a standard browser in addition ssl vpn technology supports the creation of separate vpn tunnels to each application for which a user is authorized this allows enterprises to exercise more control over who can gain access to various parts of the network and to specific applications 

  along with the need to provide secure connectivity between users and applications enterprises face an immediate and growing need to protect applications and other data center resources from applicationlevel security threats that pass through conventional firewalls and slip past intrusion detection and prevention ids and ips devices sql slammer worm a virus that infected millions of servers in a matter of minutes and nearly shut down the internet in january 2003 is a prime example of how attacks are now focused at the application level by exploiting characteristics of the user datagram protocol udp which allows direct transmission of data to a server sql slammer worm slipped past network security devices disguised as a simple data request once inside the application the code rewrote the server’s own instructions replicating and sending copies of itself to thousands of other servers because it was a “dayzero” attack — ie a brand new threat with no prior history — intrusion detection and prevention devices were not equipped with a signature to identify the sql slammer worm and were unable to prevent it 

  in the wake of the sql slammer worm and plagued by other malicious attacks enterprises have begun to look beyond traditional security measures for solutions that can detect and shut down dayzero applicationlevel attacks under the general category of application security f5’s solutions apply a “positive” security model that contrasts with the “negative” security model used by ids and ips devices in a negative security model incoming traffic is checked against a list of signatures for known worms viruses and other security threats and if no match is found the traffic is allowed to pass in a positive 

5 security model incoming traffic is checked against a set of rules that define what specific elements are permissible in traffic headed for a particular application and rejects traffic containing anything that does not conform to the rules in the case of sql slammer worm a positive security device would have recognized that the udp packet carrying the sql slammer worm was not a simple data request and blocked the transmission 

  although products that incorporate a positive security model have been around for many years they have been inherently slow and this has limited their use to enterprises that have historically placed a high priority on security now that applicationlevel attacks threaten to paralyze global business there is growing demand among enterprises for application security that can ward off these attacks the challenge is to deliver products that apply a positive security model to application traffic without slowing network performance 

  since most large enterprises have hundreds — if not thousands — of servers and applications it is not practical to build functions that optimize the performance availability and security of applications into the applications themselves even if it were maintenance costs would be prohibitive and the net result would be a negative impact on the overall performance of servers and applications deploying point solutions in the network eliminates those problems but creates a new set of challenges using point solutions from multiple vendors can create interoperability issues and problems that do occur can be difficult to troubleshoot from a security standpoint it is also much more difficult to audit traffic passing through multiple devices as a result enterprise customers are demanding products that integrate the growing number of layer 7 application traffic management and security functions on a single platform in the past we have referred to these functions collectively as “application traffic management” however as the scope and complexity of functions performed at layer 7 has increased we believe the term “application delivery networking” is more apt to describe the components of our addressable market which include application security application optimization and application availability 

the f5 solution 

  we are a leading provider of application delivery networking products that ensure the security optimization and availability of applications for any user anywhere we believe our products offer the most intelligent architecture and advanced functionality in the marketplace along with performance flexibility and usability features that help organizations improve the way they serve their employees customers and partners while lowering operational costs 

  software based products from inception we have been committed to the belief that the complexity of layer 7 application delivery networking requires a softwarebased rather than a hardwarebased solution we believe our modular software architecture enables us to deliver the broadest range of integrated functionality in the market and facilitates the addition and integration of new functionality we also believe that integrating our software with commodity hardware components enables us to build products that deliver superior performance functionality and flexibility at competitive prices 

  full proxy architecture the core of our software technology is the traffic management operating system tmos introduced in september 2004 as part of bigip version 9 we believe this is a major enhancement of our previous technology that enables bigip version 9 to deliver functionality that is superior on many levels to any other application delivery networking product in the market with tmos bigip version 9 employs a full proxy architecture that enables it to inspect modify and direct both inbound and outbound traffic flows across multiple packets this ability to manage application traffic to and from servers enables bigip version 9 to direct optimize and secure that traffic in ways that are not possible with other application delivery networking solutions 

  modular functionality in addition to its full proxy architecture tmos is specifically designed to facilitate the development and integration of application delivery networking functions as modules that can be added to bigip’s core functionality to keep pace with rapidly evolving customer needs addon modules currently available with bigip version 9 include intelligent compression ssl acceleration layer 7 rate shaping advanced client authentication ipv6 gateway caching and others recently we 

6 also began shipping trafficshield our application firewall as a software module on bigip and we are currently betatesting global traffic manager gtm and link controller modules on bigip systems at customer sites 

  application awareness the open architecture of tmos includes an application programming interface api called icontrol that allows our products to communicate with one another and with thirdparty software and devices through this unique feature thirdparty applications and network devices can take an active role in shaping ip network traffic directing traffic based on exact business requirements defined by our customers and solutions partners and tailored to specific applications this “application awareness” capability is one of the most important features of our softwarebased products and further differentiates our solutions from those of our competitors 

  adaptive intelligence the fullproxy capabilities of tmos enable it to inspect or “read” the entire contents of a transmission across multiple packets and identify specific elements of that transmission including items such as names dates and any type of number or label using our industry standard tool command language tcl scripting capability customers can use those elements as variables to create irules that modify the content and direct the flow of traffic in ways tailored to the dynamic needs of their applications 

  integrated layer 7 solutions the combination of our full proxy architecture and enhanced irules enables bigip to intercept inspect and act on the contents of traffic from virtually every type of ipenabled application in addition the modularity of the tmos architecture allows us to deliver tightly integrated solutions that secure optimize and ensure the availability of applications and the networks they run on 

  our trafficshield application firewall which we acquired in 2004 was originally designed to run on a full proxy architecture and has recently been ported to tmos using the full proxy capabilities of tmos trafficshield inspects the contents of a transmission and applies a positive security model to identify and neutralize embedded security threats by comparing the contents with rules that define permissible content for specific applications this has enabled us to integrate the application security functions of trafficshield with the security and networking features built into tmos and with the application optimization and availability functions that run on top of tmos as a result of this integration trafficshield can run as a standalone product or as a software module on bigip 

  like trafficshield our firepass sslvpn products incorporate a full proxy architecture to provide secure remote access to corporate networks incoming requests for access to the network are terminated at the device where the user is authenticated and authorized to access specific applications before the traffic is sent on to the servers that host those applications once the connection is established access is only permitted to those applications for which a user is authorized and all traffic between the user and the applications is encrypted and audited we plan to port the firepass software to tmos following the release of our nextgeneration hardware platform firepass is currently integrated with our other products primarily through icontrol 

  during the next 12 months we also plan to port the application acceleration and wan optimization technology we recently acquired from swan labs to tmos and integrate it with our other products 

strategy 

  our objective is to lead the industry in delivering the enabling architecture that integrates the network with the applications this allows organizations to significantly improve costly and time consuming business processes and provide new sources of revenue through highly differentiated offerings key components of our strategy include 

  offering a complete application security solution and product set we plan to utilize the core technologies from our bigip firepass and trafficshield products to deliver standalone and integrated systems that protect applications from hostile and inadvertent threats including usertosystem application security and systemtosystem application security problems we believe these solutions will differentiate 

7 our products in the security market and provide a unique solution to the problem of vulnerability of missioncritical applications 

  investing in technology to continue to meet customer needs we will continue to invest in research and development to provide our customers with comprehensive integrated application traffic management and security solutions our product development efforts will continue to leverage the unique attributes of our softwarebased platforms to deliver new features and functions that address the complex and changing needs of our customers we will continue to use commodity hardware in order to ensure performance and cost competitiveness 

  enhancing the existing channel model we are investing significant resources in order to further develop our indirect sales channels we plan to expand our indirect sales channels through leading industry resellers systems integrators internet service providers and other channel partners we are also recruiting new channel partners and leveraging our existing channels to sell our new security products 

  continuing to build and expand relationships with strategic icontrol partners we plan to capitalize on our strategic relationships with enterprise software vendors who have created interfaces to our products through our icontrol application programming interface these vendors provide us significant leverage in the selling process because they recommend our products to their customers in order to differentiate ourselves further from our competitors we plan to explore opportunities to further embed icontrol into existing and new third party products and to jointly market and sell our solutions to enterprise customers with these key partners 

  enhancing our brand we plan to continue building brand awareness that positions us as one of the leading providers of application delivery networking solutions our goal is to make the f5 brand to be synonymous with superior technology highquality customer service and ease of use 

products 

  our core technology is software for application delivery networking including application security and secure remote access our products are systems that integrate our software with hardware that is built using a combination of commodity components and our own custom asic for layer 4 processing our current offerings include three product families bigip firepass and trafficshield in addition we recently acquired two new application optimization products–wanjet and webacceleratorwith the purchase of swan labs 

   our family of bigip local traffic managers includes both ip application switches and server appliances members of the bigip family differ primarily in the hardware configurations that make up each system our current product family includes four application switches highend bigip 6800 and 6400 midrange bigip 3400 and an entrylevel bigip 1500 in addition to cpus for layer 7 processing all but the entrylevel systems come equipped with our own proprietary asic for highperformance layer 4 processing a commodity layer 23 switch for connectivity and commodity asics for ssl encryption and decryption and compression the bigip 520 and 540 server appliances are equipped with cpus for highspeed layer 47 processing and are designed to accommodate easilyinstalled upgrade cards that provide fast integrated ssl encryption and decryption 

  other products in our bigip systems family include bigip global traffic manager formerly called 3dns controller bigip isp traffic manager formerly called link controller and application accelerator introduced in fy05 bigip global traffic manager allows enterprises with geographically dispersed data centers to direct traffic to a particular data center in accordance with customized business rules or to redirect traffic to an available data center if one of their sites becomes overloaded or is shut down for any reason bigip isp traffic manager allows enterprises with more than one internet service provider to manage the use of their available bandwidth to minimize costs while ensuring the highest quality of service application accelerator speeds up the performance and improves the bandwidth 

8 utilization of ipbased applications running over wide area networks all three products can be purchased separately as standalone systems or bundled with bigip local traffic manager on a single system 

   our firepass systems provide ssl vpn access for remote users of ip networks and any applications connected to those networks from any standard web browser on any device the components of firepass include a dynamic policy engine which manages user authentication and authorization privileges and special components that enable corporations to give remote users controlled access to the full array of applications and resources within the network 

  our firepass line of ssl vpn servers currently includes the firepass 1000 and the firepass 4100 which support 100 and 2000 concurrent users respectively both support the complete range of firepass software features and offer a comprehensive solution for secure remote access to corporate applications firepass 1000 and 4100 are designed to support medium to large businesses 

   trafficshield is a web application firewall that provides comprehensive proactive applicationlayer protection against both generalized and targeted attacks trafficshield employs a positive security model ‘deny all unless allowed’ to permit only valid and authorized application transactions as a result trafficshield can prevent “dayzero” attacks and other types of security threats that pass through traditional firewalls and signaturebased devices such as intrusion detection and intrusion prevention systems trafficshield is available as both a standalone system and as an addon software module for our bigip product family 

   wanjet acquired with the purchase of swan labs on october 4 2005 combines wan optimization and traffic shaping in a single device to accelerate file transfers email data replication and other applications over ip networks it provides lanlike performance on any wan ensuring predictable application performance for all users and encrypts and secures all transfers without performance penalties wanjet is deployed as dualsided symmetric solution that optimizes application traffic to and from data centers and branch offices 

   webaccelerator also acquired through our purchase of swan labs speeds web transactions endtoend by optimizing individual network object requests connections and endtoend transactions from the browser through to databases installed singlesided asymmetric in the data center or dualsided symmetric in the data center and in branch locations webaccelerator enhances web application performance from any location speeding up interactive performance improving download times utilizing bandwidth more efficiently and dramatically reducing the cost and improving the response time of delivering webenabled applications to the distributed users 

  currently both wanjet and webaccelerator run on swan labs’ sl400 hardware platform in the data center and sl 200 platforms in branch locations over the next 12 to 18 months we plan to port both wanjet and webaccelerator software to run on tmos and our standard f5 hardware platforms and to integrate their technology with our other products 

   our application delivery networking products come equipped with icontrol and icontrol services manager functions which are designed to facilitate the broader use of our products icontrol allows customers and independent software vendors to modify their programs to communicate with our products eliminating the need for human involvement lowering the cost of performing basic network functions and 

9 reducing the likelihood of error although we do not derive revenue from icontrol itself the sale of icontrolenabled applications by independent software vendors such as microsoft and oracle helps promote and often leads directly to the sale of our other products 

  icontrol services manager takes advantage of icontrol to provide a single centralized management and operational interface for our devices this feature allows customers with dozens or hundreds of our products to upgrade or modify the software on those products simultaneously from a single console this lowers the cost and simplifies the task of deploying managing and maintaining our products and reduces the likelihood of error when blanket changes are implemented 

product development 

  we believe our future success depends on our ability to maintain technology leadership by constantly improving our products and by developing new products to meet the changing needs of our customers our product development group employs a standard process for the development documentation and quality control of software and systems that is designed to meet these goals this process includes working with management product marketing customers and partners to identify new or improved solutions that meet the evolving needs of our addressable markets 

  our principal software engineering group is located in our headquarters in seattle washington our core firepass product development team is located in san jose california our core trafficshield product development team is located in tel aviv israel our hardware engineering group is located in spokane washington the primary product development facility for wanjet and webaccelerator is in san jose california there is also a smaller development facility for these products in belfast northern ireland members of these teams collaborate closely with one another to ensure the interoperability and performance of our hardware and software systems in fiscal 2006 we plan to relocate our san jose development teams to a single facility 

  during the fiscal years ended september 30 2005 2004 and 2003 we had research and product development expenses of 313 million 244 million and 192 million respectively 

customers 

  our customers include a wide variety of enterprise customers fortune 1000 or business week global 1000 companies including those in telecommunications financial services technology manufacturing transportation and government in fiscal year 2005 international sales represented 405 of our net revenues refer to note 9 of our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding our revenues by geographic area 

  consistent with our goal of building a strong channel sales model the majority of our revenue is generated by sales through our distributors and valueadded resellers for fiscal year 2005 sales to ingram micro inc one of our distributors represented 186 of our revenues our agreement with ingram micro is a standard nonexclusive distribution agreement that renews automatically on an annual basis and is terminable by either party with 30 days’ prior written notice the agreement grants ingram micro the right to distribute our products to resellers in north america and certain other territories internationally with no minimum purchase requirements 

sales and marketing 

   we sell our products and services to large enterprise customers through a variety of channels including distributors valueadded resellers and systems integrators a substantial amount of our revenue for fiscal year 2005 was derived from these channel sales we also sell our products and services to major accounts through our own direct sales force our agreements with our channel partners are not exclusive and do not prevent them from selling competitive products these agreements typically have terms of one 

10 year with no obligation to renew and typically do not provide for exclusive sales territories or minimum purchase requirements 

  direct sales our field sales personnel are located in major cities throughout the americas europe the middle east and africa emea japan and the asia pacific region the inside sales team generates and qualifies leads for regional sales managers and helps manage accounts by serving as a liaison between the field and internal corporate resources we sell our products directly to a limited group of customers primarily large enterprise endusers whose accounts are managed by our major account services team field systems engineers also support our regional sales managers and channel partners by participating in joint sales calls and providing presale technical resources as needed 

  distributor and valueadded reseller relationships we have established relationships with large national and international distributors local and specialized distributors and valueadded resellers from which we derive the majority of our sales the distributors sell our products and the valueadded resellers not only sell our products but also assist their customers in network design installation and testing our field sales personnel will work closely with our channel partners to assist them if necessary in the selling of our products to their customers 

  systems integrators we also market our products through strategic relationships we have with systems integrators systems integrators leverage products like ours as a core component of application or networkbased solutions that they deploy for their customers in most cases systems integrators do not directly purchase our products for resell to their customers instead they typically recommend our products as part of a broader solution an example of this approach would be packaged enterprise resource platform erp or customer relationship management crm solutions delivered by systems integrators where our traffic management products provide high availability and increased performance for the erp or crm applications 

   there are two primary aspects to our marketing strategy first we believe our future success depends on our ability to understand and anticipate the dynamic needs of our addressable markets and that we develop valuable solutions to address those needs our marketing organization works directly with customers partners and our product development teams to identify and create innovative solutions to further enhance our leadership position the second aspect is to continue to build upon our icontrol strategy we have established relationships with various independent software vendors who have adapted their applications to interact with our products via the icontrol interface icontrol enhances the functionality of third party applications by enabling them to control the network in an automated way based on business policies and rules associated with the application as a result customers who purchase icontrolenabled applications have an incentive to purchase our products in order to take advantage of the enhanced functionality made possible through our technical cooperation we also offer an online community website called devcentral that provides technical resources to customers prospects and partners wanting to extend and optimize f5 solutions using icontrol to meet their specific needs 

  we also engage in a number of marketing programs and initiatives aimed at promoting our brand and creating market awareness of our technology and products these include actively participating in industry trade shows and briefing industry analysts and members of the trade press on our latest products and on new business and technology partnerships in addition we market our products to chief information officers and other information technology professionals through targeted advertising direct mail and highprofile web events 

backlog 

  at the end of fiscal years 2005 and 2004 we had product backlog of approximately 117 million and 106 million respectively backlog represents orders confirmed with a purchase order for products to be shipped generally within 90 days to customers with approved credit status orders are subject to cancellation rescheduling by customers or product specification changes by the customers although we 

11 believe that the backlog orders are firm purchase orders may be cancelled by the customer prior to shipment without significant penalty for this reason we believe that our product backlog at any given date is not a reliable indicator of future revenues 

customer service and technical support 

  we believe that our ability to provide consistent highquality customer service and technical support is a key factor in attracting and retaining large enterprise customers accordingly we offer a broad range of support services that include installation phone support hardware repair and replacement software updates consulting and training services we deliver these services directly to end users and also utilize a multitiered support model leveraging the capabilities of our channel partners when applicable our technical support staff is strategically located in regional service centers to support our global customer base 

  prior to the installation of our products our services personnel work with customers to analyze their network needs and determine the best way to deploy our products and configure product features and functions to meet those needs our services personnel also provide onsite installation and training services to help customers make optimal use of product features and functions 

  our customers typically purchase a oneyear maintenance contract which entitles them to an array of services provided by our technical support team maintenance services provided under the contract include online updates software error correction releases hardware repair and replacement and remote support through a 24 hours a day 7 days a week help desk although not all service contracts entitle a customer to roundtheclock call center support updates to our software are only available to customers with a current maintenance contract our technical support team also offers seminars and training classes for customers on the configuration and use of products including local and wide area network system administration and management in addition we have a professional services team able to provide a full range of feebased consulting services including comprehensive network management documentation and performance analysis and capacity planning to assist in predicting future network requirements 

  we also offer as part of our maintenance service an online automated selfhelp customer support function called ask f5 that allows customers to answer many commonly asked questions without having to call our support desk this allows the customer to rapidly address issues and questions while significantly reducing the number of calls to our support desk this enables us to provide comprehensive customer support while keeping our supportrelated expenses at a manageable consistent level 

manufacturing 

  we outsource the manufacturing of our preconfigured hardware platforms to contract manufacturers primarily solectron corporation for assembly according to our specifications the contract manufacturers install our software onto the hardware platforms and conduct functionality testing quality assurance and documentation control prior to shipping our products our agreement with solectron allows them to procure component inventory on our behalf based upon a rolling production forecast subcontractors supply solectron with standard parts and components for our products based on our production forecast we are contractually obligated to purchase component inventory that our contract manufacturer procures in accordance with the forecast unless we give notice of order cancellation in advance of applicable lead times as protection against component shortages and to provide replacement parts for our service teams we also stock limited supplies of certain key components for our products 

  hardware platforms for our products consist primarily of commodity parts and certain custom components designed and approved by our hardware engineering group most of our components are purchased from sources which we believe are readily available from other suppliers however several components used in the assembly of our products are purchased from single or limited sources such as our proprietary layer 4 asic that is manufactured for us by a third party contract semiconductor foundry 

12 competition 

  as the increasing breadth of our product offerings has enabled us to address a broader array of opportunities within the overall application delivery networking market our competition has become more numerous and more diverse our principal competitor in the traffic management market is cisco systems inc other competitors in this market include nortel networks corporation juniper networks inc which acquired redline networks inc citrix systems inc which acquired netscaler foundry networks inc and radware ltd in the adjacent wan optimization and application acceleration markets we compete mainly with juniper which recently acquired peribit systems cisco which recently acquired fineground and increasingly packeteer inc 

  in the ssl vpn market we compete with juniper citrix aventail corporation nokia nortel and symantec and a number of smaller players because ssl vpns are a potential replacement for ipsec vpns the most widely deployed solution for secure remote access today we also compete with check point software technologies ltd which along with juniper are the market leaders in ipsec vpns 

  application firewalls represent an emerging market opportunity that is populated mainly by private earlydevelopmentstage companies one of these companies teros inc was recently acquired by citrix systems as we enter this market with our trafficshield products we anticipate that we will also encounter competition from vendors of traditional firewalls and other types of security devices many of which are larger and betterknown vendors than we are 

  some of our competitors have a longer operating history and greater financial technical marketing and other resources than we do these larger competitors also have a more extensive customer base and broader customer relationships including relationships with many of our current and potential customers in addition many have large wellestablished worldwide customer support and professional services organizations and a more extensive direct sales force and sales channels because of our relatively smaller size market presence and resources our larger competitors may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements there is also the possibility that these companies may adopt aggressive pricing policies to gain market share as a result our competitors could undermine our ability to win new customers and maintain our existing customer base 

intellectual property 

  we rely on a combination of patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights we have obtained three patents in the united states and have applications pending for various aspects of our technology our future success depends in part on our ability to protect our proprietary rights to the technologies used in our principal products despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use trade secrets or other information that we regard as proprietary in addition the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights as fully as do the laws of the united states we cannot assure you that any issued patent will preserve our proprietary position or that competitors or others will not develop technologies similar to or superior to our technology our failure to enforce and protect our intellectual property rights could harm our business operating results and financial condition 

  in addition to our own proprietary software we incorporate software licensed from several thirdparty sources into our products these licenses generally renew automatically on an annual basis we believe that alternative technologies for this licensed software are available both domestically and internationally 

employees 

  as of september 30 2005 we employed 792 fulltime persons including 217 in product development 331 in sales and marketing 147 in professional services and technical support and 97 in finance administration and operations none of our employees are represented by a labor union we have experienced no work stoppages and believe that our employee relations are good

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend   the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

overview 

  we are a global provider of software and hardware products and services that help companies efficiently and securely manage their internet traffic our products enhance the delivery optimization and security of application traffic on internetbased networks we market and sell our products primarily through indirect sales channels in the americas primarily the united states europe the middle east and africa emea japan and the asia pacific region enterprise customers fortune 1000 or business week global 1000 companies in financial services transportation government and telecommunications industries continue to make up the largest percentage of our customer base 

  during the fiscal year 2005 we announced plans to acquire all of the common stock of swan labs inc for cash of 430 million the merger closed on october 4 2005 subsequent to our year end as a result of the transaction we acquired all the assets of swan labs including its principal products wanjet and webaccelerator wanjet devices are deployed in data centers and branch offices to speed up file transfers email and the performance of any ipbased application that runs over a wide area network or wan webaccelerator works in concert with wanjet to speed up the performance of ipbased enterprise applications running over wans the acquisition of swan labs expands our product line and gives us broader access to the wan optimization and web acceleration markets 

  our management monitors and analyzes a number of key performance indicators in order to manage our business and evaluate our financial and operating performance those indicators include 

 19  critical accounting policies 

  our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

  we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements 

  revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with the guidance provided under statement of position sop no 972 “software revenue recognition” and sop no 989 “modification of sop no 972 software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions” statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 48 “revenue recognition when right of return exists” and sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 101 “revenue recognition in financial statements” and sab no 104 “revenue recognition” 

  we sell products through distributors resellers and directly to end users we recognize product revenue upon shipment net of estimated returns provided that collection is determined to be probable and no significant obligations remain in certain regions where we do not have the ability to reasonably estimate returns revenue is recognized upon sale to the end user in this situation we receive a sales 

20 report from the channel partner to determine when the sales transaction to the end user has occurred payment terms to domestic customers are generally net 30 days payment terms to international customers range from net 30 to 90 days based on normal and customary trade practices in the individual markets we have offered extended payment terms ranging from three to six months to certain customers in which case revenue is recognized when payments are made 

  whenever a software license hardware installation and postcontract customer support pcs elements are combined into a package with a single “bundled” price a portion of the sales price is allocated to each element of the bundled package based on their respective fair values as determined when the individual elements are sold separately revenues from the license of software are recognized when the software has been shipped and the customer is obligated to pay for the software when rights of return are present and we cannot estimate returns we recognize revenue when such rights of return lapse revenues for pcs are recognized on a straightline basis over the service contract term pcs includes rights to upgrades when and if available a limited period of telephone support updates and bug fixes installation revenue is recognized when the product has been installed at the customer’s site consulting services are customarily billed at fixed rates plus outofpocket expenses and revenues are recognized when the consulting has been completed training revenue is recognized when the training has been completed 

  reserve for doubtful accounts estimates are used in determining our allowance for doubtful accounts and are based upon an assessment of selected accounts and as a percentage of our remaining accounts receivable by aging category in determining these percentages we evaluate historical writeoffs current trends in the credit quality of our customer base as well as changes in the credit policies we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition and do not require any collateral if there is deterioration of a major customer’s credit worthiness or actual defaults are higher than our historical experience our allowance for doubtful accounts may not be sufficient 

  reserve for product returns in some instances product revenue from distributors is subject to agreements allowing rights of return product returns are estimated based on historical experience and are recorded at the time revenues are recognized accordingly we reduce recognized revenue for estimated future returns at the time revenue is recorded when rights of return are present and we cannot estimate returns revenue is recognized when such rights lapse the estimates for returns are adjusted periodically based upon changes in historical rates of returns inventory in the distribution channel and other related factors it is possible that these estimates will change in the future or that the actual amounts could vary from our estimates 

  reserve for warranties a warranty reserve is established based on our historical experience and an estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date while we believe that our warranty reserve is adequate and that the judgment applied is appropriate such amounts estimated to be due and payable could differ materially from what will actually transpire in the future 

  accounting for income taxes we utilize the liability method of accounting for income taxes as set forth by statement of financial accounting standards no 109 “accounting for income taxes” or sfas 109 accordingly we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure including assessing the risks associated with tax audits together with assessing temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities due to the evolving nature and complexity of tax rules combined with the large number of jurisdictions in which we operate it is possible that our estimates of our tax liability could change in the future which may result in additional tax liabilities and adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

  stockbased compensation we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of financial accounting standards board “fasb” statement no 123r sharebased payment  “fas 123r” on july 1 2005 and as a result recognized 46 million of expense related to stockbased compensation charges included in operating expenses in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 prior to july 1 2005 we accounted for 

21 sharebased payments under the recognition and measurement provisions of apb opinion no 25 accounting for stock issued to employees “apb 25” and related interpretations as permitted by fasb statement no 123 accounting for stockbased compensation “fas 123” in accordance with apb 25 no compensation cost was required to be recognized for options granted that had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 

  we adopted fas 123r using the modifiedprospectivetransition method under that transition method compensation cost recognized in the fiscal year 2005 includes a compensation cost for all sharebased payments granted prior to but not yet vested as of july 1 2005 based on the grantdate fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of fas 123 and b compensation cost for all sharebased payments granted subsequent to july 1 2005 based on the grantdate fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of fas 123r the results for the prior periods have not been restated 

  effective july 1 2005 we adopted the straightline attribution method for recognizing compensation expense previously under the disclosureonly provisions of sfas 123 the company used the accelerated method of expense recognition pursuant to fasb interpretation no 28 accounting for stock appreciation rights and other variable stock option or award plans “fin 28” for all unvested options outstanding as of july 1 2005 the previously measured but unrecognized compensation expense based on the fair value at the original grant date will be recognized on an accelerated basis over the remaining vesting period for sharebased payments granted subsequent to july 1 2005 compensation expense based on the fair value on the date of grant will be recognized on a straightline basis over the vesting period as of september 30 2005 there was 327 million of total unrecognized compensation cost the majority of which will be recognized ratably over the next two years going forward stock compensation expenses may increase as we issue additional equitybased awards to continue to attract and retain key employees 

  in addition the company recently modified the method in which it issues incentive awards to its employees through stockbased compensation in prior years stockbased compensation consisted only of stock options beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 the company began to grant restricted stock unit awards instead of stock options the value of restricted stock units is determined using the intrinsic value method which in this case is based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock on the date of grant alternatively in determining the fair value of stock options we use the blackscholes option pricing model that employs the following key assumptions expected volatility is based on the annualized daily historical volatility of our stock price over the expected life of the option expected term of the option is based on historical employee stock option exercise behavior the vesting terms of the respective option and a contractual life of ten years our stock price volatility and option lives involve management’s best estimates at that time both of which impact the fair value of the option calculated under the blackscholes methodology and ultimately the expense that will be recognized over the life of the option 

  sfas 123r also requires that we recognize compensation expense for only the portion of options or stock units that are expected to vest therefore we apply estimated forfeiture rates that are derived from historical employee termination behavior our estimated forfeiture rate in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 is 5 if the actual number of forfeitures differs from those estimated by management additional adjustments to compensation expense may be required in future periods 

22 results of operations 

  the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

   net revenues total net revenues increased 644 in fiscal year 2005 from fiscal year 2004 compared to an increase of 477 in fiscal year 2004 from fiscal year 2003 the improvement was due to increased demand for our application delivery networking products and higher services revenues resulting from our increased installed base of products during fiscal year 2005 each of our primary geographic regions reported higher revenues compared to the prior year period international revenues represented 405 394 and 349 of net revenues in fiscal years 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively we expect international sales will continue to represent a significant portion of net revenues although we cannot provide assurance that international revenues as a percentage of net revenues will remain at current levels 

  net product revenues increased 741 in fiscal year 2005 and 498 in fiscal year 2004 as compared to the previous fiscal year respectively the increase in fiscal 2005 was primarily due to absolute growth in the volume of product sales of our bigip product line as well as incremental revenues derived from sales of our firepass and trafficshield product lines sales of our bigip family of application delivery networking products represented 891 903 and 993 of total product revenues in fiscal years 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively the decrease as a percentage of total sales was due to an improvement in sales of our other products such as our firepass products which represented 97 of product revenues in fiscal year 2005 

  net service revenues increased 373 in fiscal year 2005 compared to a 420 increase for fiscal year 2004 from the prior year respectively the decrease in the growth rate was due to an increase in the amount of support services provided by our channel partners the increase of services revenues in absolute dollars was the result of a growing customer base and continued growth in service renewals from existing customers 

23   ingram micro inc one of our domestic distributors accounted for 186 191 and 126 of our total net revenues in fiscal years 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively ingram micro accounted for 262 269 and 178 of our accounts receivable as of september 30 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively 

   cost of net product revenues cost of net product revenues consist of finished products purchased from our contract manufacturers manufacturing overhead freight warranty provisions for excess and obsolete inventory and amortization expenses in connection with developed technology from acquisitions cost of net product revenues as a percentage of net product revenues remained relatively consistent at 223 in fiscal year 2005 as compared to 225 and 212 in fiscal years 2004 and 2003 respectively the increase in absolute dollars is consistent with the increase in product revenues for the corresponding period higher indirect product costs including amortization charges of our acquired technology and warranty costs associated with the growth in overall product installation base contributed to the percentage increase as compared to fiscal year 2003 

  cost of net service revenues cost of net service revenues consist of the salaries and related benefits of our professional services staff travel facilities and depreciation expenses cost of net service revenues as a percentage of net service revenues increased to 262 in fiscal year 2005 as compared to 244 and 286 in fiscal years 2004 and 2003 respectively the increase in fiscal year 2005 is primarily due to increased salary and benefits attributed to growth in headcount professional services headcount at the end of fiscal year 2005 increased to 147 from 124 at the end of fiscal year 2004 going forward we expect to continue to increase our cost of service revenues to support our expanded product lines and growing customer base 

 24   sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses consist of salaries commissions and related benefits of our sales and marketing staff the costs of our marketing programs including public relations advertising and trade shows travel facilities and depreciation expenses stockbased compensation charges for awards to our sales and marketing personnel are included beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2005 the decrease in sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total net revenues is the result of leveraging our existing sales and distribution infrastructure to support the increased net revenues in absolute dollars sales and marketing expenses increased 365 in fiscal year 2005 and 223 in fiscal year 2004 as compared to the previous fiscal year respectively the increases were primarily due to higher commission and personnel costs consistent with the increased revenue and headcount for the corresponding period sales and marketing headcount at the end of fiscal 2005 increased to 331 from 229 at the end of fiscal 2004 and 211 at the end of fiscal 2003 stockbased compensation charges of 18 million contributed to the overall increase in fiscal year 2005 we expect to continue to increase sales and marketing expenses in absolute dollars in order to grow revenues and increase our market share 

  research and development research and development expenses consist of the salaries and related benefits for our product development personnel prototype materials and expenses related to the development of new and improved products facilities and depreciation expenses in absolute dollars research and development expenses increased 287 in fiscal year 2005 and 266 in fiscal year 2004 as compared to the previous fiscal year respectively the increases in fiscal years 2005 and 2004 were primarily due to higher salary and benefits costs attributed to an increase in headcount to 217 in fiscal year 2005 from 185 in fiscal year 2004 and 145 in fiscal 2003 the growth in employee headcount was primarily related to enhancement of our current products and our ability to develop new technologically advanced products that meet the changing needs of our customers stockbased compensation charges of 13 million contributed to the overall increase in fiscal year 2005 we expect to continue to increase research and development expenses as our future success is dependent on the continued development of our products 

  general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist of the salaries benefits and related costs of our executive finance information technology human resource and legal personnel thirdparty professional service fees bad debt charges facilities and depreciation expenses the decrease in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total net revenues is the result of leveraging our existing corporate infrastructure to support the increased net revenues in absolute dollars general and administrative expenses increased 510 in fiscal year 2005 and increased 310 in fiscal year 2004 as compared to the previous fiscal year respectively the increase in fiscal year 2005 is due to increased salary and benefit expenses of 26 million and higher professional service fees of 19 million the increase in personnel costs is consistent with the growth in headcount general and administrative headcount at the end of fiscal 2005 increased to 97 from 75 at the end of fiscal 2004 stockbased compensation charges of 11 million contributed to the overall increase in fiscal year 2005 the increase 

25 in general and administrative expenses is expected to remain at these increased levels as the company continues to build its infrastructure to support the worldwide growth of our business 

   other income net other income net consists of interest income and foreign currency transaction gains and losses other income net increased 1957 in fiscal year 2005 and increased 2636 in fiscal year 2004 as compared to the previous fiscal year respectively the significant increase was due to a combination of higher yields and increased investment balances the increased investment balances are the result of cash provided from operating and financing activities during the fiscal years 2005 and fiscal year 2004 net proceeds of 1136 million received from the sale of common stock in a public offering completed in november of 2003 was the most significant addition to our investment balances 

  provision for income taxes we recorded a 35 provision for income taxes for the fiscal year 2005 as of fiscal yearend 2005 we do not have a valuation allowance on any of our deferred tax assets in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate because we believe that the assets are more likely than not to be realized in making this determination we have considered projected future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the appropriateness of a valuation allowance our net deferred tax assets as of fiscal year end 2005 2004 and 2003 were 401 million 314 million and 0 million respectively our world wide effective tax rate may fluctuate based on a number of factors including variations in projected taxable income in our geographic locations changes in the valuation of our net deferred tax assets resolution of potential exposures introduction of new accounting standards or changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof we have recorded liabilities to address potential exposures related to business and income tax positions we have taken that could be challenged by taxing authorities the ultimate resolution of these potential exposures may be greater or less than the liabilities recorded which could result in an adjustment to our future tax expense 

  in fiscal year 2004 the primary difference between the statutory tax rate and the effective tax rate was due to previously unrecognized deferred tax assets which were recognized sfas 109 provides for the recognition of deferred tax assets if realization is more likely than not based on available evidence which includes our historical operating performance and the reported cumulative net losses in all prior years we had provided for a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets at the end of fiscal year 2003 based upon our operating performance in fiscal year 2004 and projected future taxable income we determined that our us deferred tax assets were more likely than not to be realizable therefore the valuation allowance was reversed and as a result we realized an income tax benefit of 73 million the credit from the release of the valuation allowance was partially offset by actual us and international tax 

26 expenses resulting in a net benefit for income taxes of 39 million in fiscal year 2004 the provision for income taxes in fiscal year 2003 consisted primarily of taxes payable in foreign jurisdictions 

liquidity and capital resources 

  we have funded our operations with our cash balances cash generated from operations and proceeds from public offerings 

   cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and longterm investments totaled 3650 million as of september 30 2005 compared to 2223 million as of september 30 2004 representing an increase of 1427 million the increase was due to the cash flow from operations and cash from employee stock option exercises in fiscal year 2004 overall cash and investments increased 1433 million compared to the fiscal year 2003 the increase was primarily due to the net proceeds of 1136 million from the sale of 5175000 shares of common stock in a public offering completed in november 2003 

  cash provided by operating activities during fiscal year 2005 was 850 million compared to 406 million in fiscal year 2004 and 146 million in fiscal year 2003 cash provided by operating activities resulted primarily from cash generated from net income after adjusting for noncash charges changes in operating assets and liabilities and an increase in advance payments from customers 

  cash used in investing activities was 1268 million for the fiscal year 2005 1647 million for fiscal year 2004 and 381 million for fiscal year 2003 the cash used in the fiscal year 2005 was primarily due to the purchase of investments and property and equipment partially offset by the sale of investments the cash used in fiscal year 2004 was due to the purchase of investments primarily made possible by the proceeds of our public offering and the purchase of property and equipment and the acquisition of magnifire partially offset by the sale of investments the cash used in fiscal year 2003 was primarily the result of the cash used to acquire substantially all the assets of uroam and the purchase of investments and property and equipment partially offset by the sale of investments 

  cash provided by financing activities was 689 million for fiscal year 2005 compared to 1385 million for fiscal year 2004 and 128 million for the fiscal year 2003 in fiscal years 2005 and 2003 our financing activities consisted of cash proceeds received from the exercise of stock options and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan during the fiscal year 2004 our financing activities included 1136 million of net proceeds received from a public stock offering as well as cash received from the exercise of employee stock options and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan 

  we expect that our existing cash and investment balances and cash from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated working capital and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future 

27 obligations and commitments 

  the following table summarizes our contractual payment obligations and commitments as of september 30 2005 

   we lease our facilities under operating leases that expire at various dates through 2014 

  purchase obligations are comprised of purchase commitments with our contract manufacturers the agreement with our primary contract manufacturer allows them to procure component inventory on our behalf based on our production forecast we are obligated to purchase component inventory that the contract manufacturer procures in accordance with the forecast unless cancellation is given within applicable lead times 

recent accounting pronouncements 

  in march 2004 the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on issue no 031 “the meaning of otherthantemporary impairment and its application to certain investments” eitf 031 provides guidance on otherthantemporary impairment models for marketable debt and equity securities accounted for under sfas no 115 “accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities” and sfas no 124 “accounting for certain investments held by notforprofit organizations” and nonmarketable equity securities accounted for under the cost method the eitf developed a basic threestep model to evaluate whether an investment is otherthantemporarily impaired on september 30 2004 the fasb approved the issuance of fasb staff position fsp eitf 0311 which delays the effective date until additional guidance is issued for the application of the recognition and measurement provisions of eitf 031 to investments in securities that are impaired in november 2005 the fasb issued fsp fas 1151 and fas 1241 “the meaning of otherthantemporary impairment and its application to certain investments” this fsp addresses the determination as to when an investment is considered impaired whether the impairment is other than temporary and the measurement of an impairment loss this statement specifically nullifies the requirements of paragraph 1018 of eitf 031 and references existing otherthantemporary impairment guidance the guidance under this fsp is effective for reporting periods beginning after december 15 2005 and the company continued to apply relevant “otherthantemporary” guidance as provided for in fsp eitf 0311 during fiscal 2005 the company does not expect the adoption of fsp fas 1151 and fas 1241 to have a material effect on the company’s results of operations or financial condition

28 risk factors 

  in addition to the other information in this report the following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating our company and its business 

our success depends on our timely development of new products and features market acceptance of new product offerings and proper management of the timing of the life cycle of our products 

  we expect the application delivery networking market to be characterized by rapid technological change frequent new product introductions changes in customer requirements and evolving industry standards our continued success depends on our ability to identify and develop new products and new features for our existing products to meet the demands of these changes and for those products and features to be accepted by our existing and target customers if we are unable to identify develop and deploy new products and new product features on a timely basis our business and results of operations may be harmed 

  in september 2004 we announced the release of our nextgeneration bigip product featuring the traffic management operating system or tmos this major new version of bigip represented the culmination of over two years of research and development efforts tmos is specifically designed to facilitate the development and integration of application delivery functions as modules that can be added to bigip’s core functionality to keep pace with rapidly evolving customer needs we currently offer software modules as addons for this product and our continued success depends significantly on our ability to integrate new modules and functionality onto this platform and the acceptance of the new hardware and software platforms associated with this release by our existing and target customers 

  the current life cycle of our products is typically 12 to 24 months the introduction of new products or product enhancements may shorten the life cycle of our existing products or replace sales of some of our current products thereby offsetting the benefit of even a successful product introduction and may cause customers to defer purchasing our existing products in anticipation of the new products this could harm our operating results by decreasing sales increasing our inventory levels of older products and exposing us to greater risk of product obsolescence we have also experienced and may in the future experience delays in developing and releasing new products and product enhancements this has led to and may in the future lead to delayed sales increased expenses and lower quarterly revenue than anticipated also in the development of our products we have experienced delays in the prototyping of our products which in turn has led to delays in product introductions in addition complexity and difficulties in managing product transitions at the endoflife stage of a product can create excess inventory of components associated with the outgoing product that can lead to increased expenses any or all of the above problems could materially harm our business and operating results 

our success depends on sales and continued innovation of our bigip product lines 

  for the fiscal year ended september 30 2005 we derived 891 of our product revenues from sales of our bigip family of application delivery networking product lines we expect to derive a significant portion of our net revenues from sales of our bigip products in the future implementation of our strategy depends upon bigip being able to solve critical network availability and performance problems of our customers if bigip is unable to solve these problems for our customers or if we are unable to sustain the high levels of innovation in bigip’s product feature set needed to maintain leadership in what will continue to be a competitive market environment our business and results of operations will be harmed 

we may not be able to compete effectively in the emerging application delivery networking market 

  the markets we serve are new rapidly evolving and highly competitive and we expect competition to persist and intensify in the future our principal competitors in the application delivery networking market include cisco systems inc nortel networks corporation foundry networks inc citrix systems inc radware ltd and juniper networks inc we expect to continue to face additional competition as new 

29 participants enter our market in addition larger companies with significant resources brand recognition and sales channels may form alliances with or acquire competing application delivery networking solutions and emerge as significant competitors potential competitors may bundle their products or incorporate an internet traffic management or security component into existing products in a manner that discourages users from purchasing our products 

our quarterly and annual operating results are volatile and may cause our stock price to fluctuate 

  our quarterly and annual operating results have varied significantly in the past and will vary significantly in the future which makes it difficult for us to predict our future operating results in particular we anticipate that the size of customer orders may increase as we continue to focus on larger business accounts a delay in the recognition of revenue even from just one account may have a significant negative impact on our results of operations for a given period in the past a majority of our sales have been realized near the end of a quarter accordingly a delay in an anticipated sale past the end of a particular quarter may negatively impact our results of operations for that quarter or in some cases that year additionally we have exposure to the credit risks of some of our customers and subtenants although we have programs in place that are designed to monitor and mitigate the associated risk there can be no assurance that such programs will be effective in reducing our credit risks adequately we monitor individual payment capability in granting credit arrangements seek to limit the total credit to amounts we believe our customers can pay and maintain reserves we believe are adequate to cover exposure for potential losses if there is a deterioration of a subtenant’s or major customer’s creditworthiness or actual defaults are higher than expected future resulting losses if incurred could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

  further our operating results may be below the expectations of securities analysts and investors in future quarters or years our failure to meet these expectations will likely harm the market price of our common stock 

the average selling price of our products may decrease and our costs may increase which may negatively impact gross profits 

  it is possible that the average selling prices of our products will decrease in the future in response to competitive pricing pressures increased sales discounts new product introductions by us or our competitors or other factors therefore in order to maintain our gross profits we must develop and introduce new products and product enhancements on a timely basis and continually reduce our product costs our failure to do so will cause our net revenue and gross profits to decline which will harm our business and results of operations in addition we may experience substantial periodtoperiod fluctuations in future operating results due to the erosion of our average selling prices 

it is difficult to predict our future operating results because we have an unpredictable sales cycle 

  our products have a lengthy sales cycle which is difficult to predict historically our sales cycle has ranged from approximately two to three months and has tended to lengthen as we have increasingly focused our sales efforts on the enterprise market also as our distribution strategy has evolved into more of a channel model utilizing valueadded resellers distributors and systems integrators the level of variability in the length of sales cycle across transactions has increased and made it more difficult to predict the timing of many of our sales transactions sales of our products require us to educate potential customers in their use and benefits sales of our products are subject to delays from the lengthy internal budgeting approval and competitive evaluation processes that large corporations and governmental entities may require for example customers frequently begin by evaluating our products on a limited basis and devote time and resources to testing our products before they decide whether or not to purchase customers may also defer orders as a result of anticipated releases of new products or enhancements by our competitors or us as a result our products have an unpredictable sales cycle that contributes to the uncertainty of our future operating results 

30 our business may be harmed if our contract manufacturers are not able to provide us with adequate supplies of our products or if a single source of hardware assembly is lost or impaired 

  we rely on third party contract manufacturers to assemble our products we outsource the manufacturing of our hardware platforms to contract manufacturers who assemble these hardware platforms to our specifications we have experienced minor delays in shipments from contract manufacturers in the past however if we experience major delays in the future or other problems such as inferior quality and insufficient quantity of product any one or a combination of these factors may harm our business and results of operations the inability of our contract manufacturers to provide us with adequate supplies of our products or the loss of our contract manufacturer may cause a delay in our ability to fulfill orders while we obtain a replacement manufacturer and may harm our business and results of operations in particular because we subcontract substantially all of our manufacturing to a single contract manufacturer with whom we do not have a longterm contract any termination loss or impairment in our arrangement with this single source of hardware assembly or any impairment of their facilities or operations would harm our business financial condition and results of operation 

  if the demand for our products grows we will need to increase our raw material and component purchases contract manufacturing capacity and internal test and quality control functions any disruptions in product flow may limit our revenue may harm our competitive position and may result in additional costs or cancellation of orders by our customers 

our business could suffer if there are any interruptions or delays in the supply of hardware components from our thirdparty sources 

  we currently purchase several hardware components used in the assembly of our products from a number of single or limited sources lead times for these components vary significantly the unavailability of suitable components any interruption or delay in the supply of any of these hardware components or the inability to procure a similar component from alternate sources at acceptable prices within a reasonable time may delay assembly and sales of our products and hence our revenues and may harm our business and results of operations 

we may not adequately protect our intellectual property and our products may infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties 

  we rely on a combination of patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure of confidential and proprietary information to protect our intellectual property rights despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology monitoring unauthorized use of our products is difficult and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of our technology particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 

  our industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the ordinary course of our business we are involved in disputes and licensing discussions with others regarding their claimed proprietary rights and cannot assure you that we will always successfully defend ourselves against such claims if we are found to infringe the proprietary rights of others or if we otherwise settle such claims we could be compelled to pay damages or royalties and either obtain a license to those intellectual property rights or alter our products so that they no longer infringe upon such proprietary rights any license could be very expensive to obtain or may not be available at all similarly changing our products or processes to avoid infringing the rights of others may be costly or impractical in addition we have initiated and may in the future initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights to determine the scope and validity of our proprietary rights or those of our competitors any of these claims whether claims that we are infringing the proprietary rights of others or vice versa with or without merit may be timeconsuming result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel or require us to cease using infringing technology develop noninfringing 

31 technology or enter into royalty or licensing agreements further our license agreements typically require us to indemnify our customers distributors and resellers for infringement actions related to our technology which could cause us to become involved in infringement claims made against our customers distributors or resellers any of the abovedescribed circumstances relating to intellectual property rights disputes could result in our business and results of operations being harmed 

  many of our products include intellectual property licensed from third parties in the future it may be necessary to renew licenses for third party intellectual property or obtain new licenses for other technology these third party licenses may not be available to us on acceptable terms if at all the inability to obtain certain licenses or litigation regarding the interpretation or enforcement of license rights and related intellectual property issues could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition furthermore we license some third party intellectual property on a nonexclusive basis and this may limit our ability to protect our intellectual property rights in our products 

we may not be able to sustain or develop new distribution relationships and a reduction or delay in sales to a significant distribution partner could hurt our business 

  our sales strategy requires that we establish and maintain multiple distribution channels in the united states and internationally through leading industry resellers systems integrators internet service providers and other channel partners we have a limited number of agreements with companies in these channels and we may not be able to increase our number of distribution relationships or maintain our existing relationships if we are unable to establish or maintain our indirect sales channels our business and results of operations will be harmed in addition one domestic distributor of our products accounted for 186 and 191 of our total net revenue for the fiscal years 2005 and 2004 respectively a substantial reduction or delay in sales of our products to this or any other key distribution partner could harm our business operating results and financial condition 

undetected software errors may harm our business and results of operations 

  software products frequently contain undetected errors when first introduced or as new versions are released we have experienced these errors in the past in connection with new products and product upgrades we expect that these errors will be found from time to time in new or enhanced products after commencement of commercial shipments these problems may cause us to incur significant warranty and repair costs divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts and cause significant customer relations problems we may also be subject to liability claims for damages related to product errors while we carry insurance policies covering this type of liability these policies may not provide sufficient protection should a claim be asserted a material product liability claim may harm our business and results of operations 

  our products must successfully operate with products from other vendors as a result when problems occur in a network it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem the occurrence of software errors whether caused by our products or another vendor’s products may result in the delay or loss of market acceptance of our products the occurrence of any of these problems may harm our business and results of operations 

our operating results are exposed to risks associated with international commerce 

  as our international sales increase our operating results become more exposed to international operating risks these risks include risks related to potential recessions in economies outside the united states foreign currency exchange rates managing foreign sales offices regulatory political or economic conditions in specific countries military conflict or terrorist activities changes in laws and tariffs inadequate protection of intellectual property rights in foreign countries foreign regulatory requirements and natural disasters all of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business we intend to continue expanding into international markets international sales represented 405 and 394 of our net revenues for the fiscal years ended september 30 2005 and 2004 respectively in particular in fiscal 

32 year 2005 we derived 137 of our total revenue from the japanese market this revenue is dependent on a number of factors outside our control including the viability and success of our resellers and the strength of the japanese economy 

changes in governmental regulations could negatively affect our revenues 

  our products are subject to various regulations promulgated by the united states and various foreign governments including but not limited to environmental regulations and regulations implementing export license requirements and restrictions on the import or export of some technologies especially encryption technology changes in governmental regulation and our inability or failure to obtain required approvals permits or registrations could harm our international and domestic sales and adversely affect our revenues business and operations 

acquisitions including our recent acquisition of swan labs present many risks and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that are contemplated at the time of the transaction 

  with respect to our acquisitions as well as any other future acquisitions we may undertake we may find that the acquired assets do not further our business strategy as expected or that we paid more than what the assets are later worth or that economic conditions change all of which may generate future impairment charges there may be difficulty integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired business and we may have difficulty retaining the key personnel of the acquired business we may have difficulty in incorporating the acquired technologies or products with our existing product lines our ongoing business and management’s attention may be disrupted or diverted by transition or integration issues and the complexity of managing geographically and culturally diverse locations we may have difficulty maintaining uniform standards controls procedures and policies across locations we may experience significant problems or liabilities associated with the product quality technology and other matters 

  our inability to successfully operate and integrate newlyacquired businesses appropriately effectively and in a timely manner or to retain key personnel of any acquired business could have a material adverse effect on our ability to take advantage of further growth in demand for integrated traffic management and security solutions and other advances in technology as well as on our revenues gross margins and expenses 

our success depends on our key personnel and our ability to attract and retain qualified sales and marketing operations product development and professional services personnel 

  our success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our key management product development sales marketing and finance personnel many of whom may be difficult to replace the complexity of our application delivery networking products and their integration into existing networks and ongoing support as well as the sophistication of our sales and marketing effort requires us to retain highly trained professional services customer support and sales personnel competition for qualified professional services customer support and sales personnel in our industry is intense because of the limited number of people available with the necessary technical skills and understanding of our products our ability to retain and hire these personnel may be adversely affected by volatility or reductions in the price of our common stock since these employees are generally granted stock options the loss of services of any of our key personnel the inability to retain and attract qualified personnel in the future or delays in hiring qualified personnel may harm our business and results of operations 

we face litigation risks 

  we are a party to lawsuits in the normal course of our business litigation in general and intellectual property and securities litigation in particular can be expensive lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations moreover the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict responding to the 

33 allegations has been and will likely continue to be expensive and timeconsuming for us an unfavorable resolution of the lawsuits could adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

antitakeover provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us 

  our board of directors has the authority to issue up to 10000000 shares of preferred stock and to determine the price rights preferences privileges and restrictions including voting rights of those shares without any further vote or action by the stockholders the rights of the holders of common stock may be subject to and may be adversely affected by the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future the issuance of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a change of control of our company without further action by our stockholders and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of the holders of common stock further certain provisions of our bylaws including a provision limiting the ability of stockholders to raise matters at a meeting of stockholders without giving advance notice may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or management of our company which could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock in addition our articles of incorporation provide for a staggered board which may make it more difficult for a third party to gain control of our board of directors similarly state antitakeover laws in the state of washington related to corporate takeovers may prevent or delay a change of control of our company

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk tableend   interest rate risk our cash equivalents consist of highquality securities as specified in our investment policy guidelines the policy limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue or issuer to a maximum of 5 of the total portfolio with the exception of us treasury securities commercial paper and money market funds which are exempt from size limitation the policy requires investments in securities that mature in three years or less with the average maturity being no greater than one and a half years these securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if interest rates increase a decrease of one percent in the average interest rate would have resulted in a decrease of approximately 26 million in our interest income for the fiscal year 2005 

 34    foreign currency risk the majority of our sales and expenses are denominated in us dollars and as a result we have not experienced significant foreign currency transaction gains and losses to date while we have conducted some transactions in foreign currencies during the fiscal year ended september 30 2005 and expect to continue to do so we do not anticipate that foreign currency transaction gains or losses will be significant at our current level of operations however as we continue to expand our operations internationally transaction gains or losses may become significant in the future we have not engaged in foreign currency hedging to date however we may do so in the future

 item 9a controls and procedures tableend management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

  evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that required information is properly recorded processed summarized and reported within the required timeframe as specified in the rules set forth by the securities and exchange commission our disclosure controls and procedures are also designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated to management including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures we have reviewed our disclosure controls and procedures prior to the filing of this annual report and based on that review we have concluded that the company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective in design and operation as of september 30 2005 

  changes in internal control over financial reporting during the fourth fiscal quarter there were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting that materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal controls over financial reporting 

  limitations of internal control over financial reporting internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion of improper management override because of such limitations there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting however these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process therefore it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce though not eliminate this risk 

  management’s report on internal control over financial reporting we have assessed the effectiveness of our company’s internal control over financial reporting as of september 30 2005 in making this assessment we used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal control — integrated framework based on our assessment using those criteria we concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of september 30 2005 our management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of september 30 2005 has been audited by pricewaterhousecoopers llp an independent registered public accounting firm as stated in their report which appears herein

is independent none of the company’s executive officers served as a member of the board of directors or compensation committee of any entity that has had one or more executive officers which served as a member of the company’s board of directors or compensation committee report of compensation committee the compensation committee is comprised of three members of the board of directors who are not employees of the company it is responsible for setting and monitoring policies governing compensation of executive officers the compensation committee reviews the performance and compensation levels for executive officers and sets salary and bonus levels and option grants under the company’s stock option plans the objectives of the committee are to correlate executive compensation with the company’s business objectives and performance and to enable the company to attract retain and reward executive officers who contribute to its longterm success compensation philosophy the company’s philosophy concerning compensation for executive officers is to directly link their compensation to continuous improvements in the company’s financial performance the key elements of this philosophy are as follows  consistent with this philosophy the compensation package offered to executive officers includes base salary cash incentive compensation in the form of bonuses and longterm equity incentives in the form of stock options salary the compensation committee consists of three independent directors its function is to annually assess the performance of and recommend to the full board salary and incentive compensation for the president and chief executive officer the compensation committee also reviews and approves annual salary and incentive compensation increases for other executive officers recommended by the president and chief executive officer in setting mr mcadam’s compensation the committee considers compensation levels for similar positions at public companies of similar size and revenue levels in similar industries and with similar technological and marketing challenges operational complexities and longterm performance and growth objectives the committee reviews salary surveys and publicly available information on compensation levels in performing this analysis over the past several years the committee also considered the company’s success in meeting its operational financial and strategic goals under extremely difficult economic conditions mr mcadam’s success in reworking the company’s business model to focus on enterprise customers and the strength of the executive team built by mr mcadam mr mcadam began his employment with the company in july 2000 with a salary and bonus comparable to his thencurrent compensation level with his former employer his base salary was increased by 6 for fiscal 8 2002 and by 5 for fiscal 2003 consistent with base salary increases for the rest of the company’s executive officers in those years at mr mcadam’s request no increase was granted for fiscal 2004 in determining executive officer salaries the compensation committee reviews recommendations from mr mcadam which are based on information from salary surveys covering technology companies in the seattle and other comparable areas individual performance levels and the company’s financial condition the compensation committee also considers incentive compensation based on the company’s financial performance incentive compensation to reinforce the attainment of company goals the committee believes that a significant portion of the annual compensation of the executive officers should be in the form of incentive compensation the committee believes that incentives based on attaining or exceeding established financial targets properly aligns the interests of the executive officers with the interests of the stockholders bonuses for mr mcadam and the other executive officers are awarded quarterly based on achievement of the company’s top and bottom line objectives mr mcadam’s bonus is set at 75 of his base salary for meeting these performance targets mr mcadam and the other executive officers may earn additional bonuses for overachievement of these targets stock options the compensation committee believes that employee equity ownership provides significant motivation to executive officers to maximize value for the company’s shareholders and periodically approves stock option grants under the company’s employee stock option plans stock options are typically granted at the current market price and will only have value if the company’s stock price increases over the exercise price the compensation committee reviews and approves recommendations made by the chief executive officer on stock option grants for other executive officers these recommendations for options are based on the relative position and responsibilities of each executive officer and previous and expected contributions of each officer to the company’s success generally option grants vest over a two or fouryear period upon joining the company mr mcadam was given options in an amount comparable to those given to other nonfounder executives hired to perform similar functions in comparable companies this initial option grant was subsequently cancelled at his request mr mcadam has been awarded several additional option grants in amounts considered by the compensation committee to be appropriate considering mr mcadam’s performance and market conditions under the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1993 the federal income tax deduction for certain types of compensation paid to the chief executive officer and four other most highly compensated executive officers of publicly held companies is limited to 1 million per officer per fiscal year unless such compensation meets certain requirements the compensation committee is aware of this limitation and had decided that it is not appropriate at this time to limit the company’s discretion to design the cash compensation packages payable to the company’s executive officers  stock price performance the information regarding stock price performance contained in this section shall not be deemed to be “soliciting material” or to be “filed” with the securities and exchange commission nor shall such information be incorporated by reference into any future filings

network devices in a way that maximizes the availability scalability and throughput of those network components and the applications that run on them our recently acquired firepass family of network server appliances provides secure user access to corporate networks and individual applications through any standard web browser our unique icontrol architecture enables our products to communicate with one another in the network and ensure optimal throughput of traffic and also allows them to be integrated with third party products including enterprise applications this facilitates the

many elements required for successful internet and intranet business applications including high availability high performance intelligent load balancing streamlined manageability remote access to corporate networks and network and application security our solution for application traffic management and security is softwarebased which differentiates us from our competitors whose solutions are largely hardwarebased we believe this differentiation enables us to offer our customers greater flexibility costeffectiveness and adaptability in response to today’s rapidly changing environment   enterprise customers fortune 1000 or business week global 1000 companies in financial services manufacturing transportation and mobile telecommunications make up the largest percentage of our customer base we market and sell our products primarily through indirect sales channels in north america europe and the asia pacific region and to some direct customer accounts in north america we have subsidiaries or branch offices in australia canada china france germany hong kong japan the netherlands singapore south korea spain taiwan thailand and the united kingdom   in july 2003 we acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of uroam inc or uroam for 250 million in cash we also incurred 24 million of direct transaction costs for a net purchase price of 274 million we hired substantially all of uroam’s 20 employees consisting of product development sales and service personnel uroam’s family of firepass servers is a comprehensive remote access product set

february 26 1996 in the state of washington our headquarters is in seattle washington and our mailing address is 401 elliott avenue west seattle washington 98119 the telephone number at our executive offices is 206 2725555 our annual reports on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and all amendments to those reports are available free of charge on our website wwwf5com as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with the securities and exchange commission industry background   as a result of the internet’s capabilities it has become a fundamental tool for commerce and communications since the late 1990’s businesses have responded to the power flexibility and economy of the internet by deploying new internet protocol or ip based applications upgrading their clientserver applications to new ipenabled versions and enabling existing applications for use over the internet ip is a communications language that is used for transmitting data over the internet during the next several years we believe this process of deploying ipenabled applications will accelerate as web services enable businesses to build applications quickly and easily by integrating software modules available from many different sources web services allow businesses to combine functions of existing applications and processes to create new applications and functionality operating over the internet and beyond the corporate firewall the purpose of web services is to enable applications to interact with each other more smoothly reducing inefficiencies associated with human intervention a fullyintegrated web servicesenabled computing network would allow personal computers servers handheld devices programs applications and network equipment to work together directly to generate more efficient data flow and application development and use in addition we believe that the growth of internet usage will continue to be driven by new applications such as voice over ip or voip increased penetration of broadband internet access enabling the remote use of more applications and the increasing popularity of mobile internet access through wireless devices such as cellular telephones personal digital assistants and notebook computers   current traffic management products are designed primarily to manage web traffic however few products are equipped with the functionality and flexibility to securely manage the full range of ipenabled applications such as oracle financials bea weblogic and siebel sales force automation   internet architecture   the open systems interconnect reference model or osi model is the framework that describes and defines how networked systems communicate with one another the osi model divides network functions into seven layers and specifies how the layers should interact to enable interoperability between the various users these interoperability standards have been designed to allow all parts of the network to work together regardless of the different hardware and software components ip requires all data transmitted across the internet to be divided into packets prior to its transmission and reassembled at its destination prior to transmission each packet of data is automatically given a header that identifies the source and destination of the packet this header information is used in the osi model for the purposes of identifying routing and sequencing data packets and is stripped from the data upon arrival at its destination   layer 47 traffic management   layers 2 and 3 of the osi model primarily perform standardized repetitive tasks such as ensuring that packets of information sent over the internet arrive at the destination to which they are addressed and reassembling them in the correct sequence unlike layers 2 and 3 layers 47 are complex and variable and must support enduser applications and processes on a wide variety of platforms and devices for example layer 7 which encompasses the functions of layers 5 and 6 enables email directory lookup and the transfer of files between otherwise incompatible systems   while traditional layer 23 switching devices are used primarily to ensure correct delivery of packets of information there is an increasing need for layer 7 technology that can read the entire contents of a packetized transmission and make intelligent decisions based on a dynamic set of business rules about how to 4 handle the transmission and where to route it to ensure the availability and optimal performance of applications servers and the network additionally layer 23 as well as layer 4 switching devices are primarily hardwarebased and are optimized for speed at the expense of flexibility while most manufacturers of layer 7 switching devices have also opted for the traditional costly hardwarebased solutions this limits the ability of their products to adapt to the rapidly changing requirements of layer 7 traffic management needed for common enduser applications today 

  according to the “ethernet switch report — 5year forecast” prepared by dell’oro group the traditional layer 47 traffic management market is expected to grow from 432 million in 2002 to 870 million in 2007 representing a fiveyear compounded annual growth rate of approximately 15 additional emerging growth markets for layer 47 traffic management include blade servers mobile ip and web services a blade server is a thin modular electronic circuit board intended for a single dedicated application such as serving web pages or server load balancing that can be easily inserted into a spacesaving chassis with many similar blade servers blade servers loaded into chassis are designed to consume less energy and require considerably less space than conventional servers   growth in demand for secure traffic management   as internet traffic and the use of ipenabled applications have increased the demands placed on layer 7 have also increased and so has the demand for integrated effective layer 7 traffic management solutions corporations are becoming more reliant on highly sophisticated ipenabled applications both for their internal operations and for interactions with external customers and partners the need to guarantee the security of electronic information and transactions has led to the emergence of ssl encryption as the standard for secure ipenabled traffic during the interaction between a user and a financial application for example data sent from the user to the server is typically encrypted by the user’s web browser and decrypted by the server and this process is reversed for data sent back to the user the use of ssl has continued to grow with the proliferation of webbased applications that require secure transactions increases in the number and sophistication of web attacks and the damage caused by such attacks are also driving demand for more effective security solutions   ssl is also the core of new technology that addresses the growing need for corporations to provide secure connectivity for the rapidly increasing number of users who access corporate networks and applications from remote locations using a variety of devices ranging from home personal computers and laptops to cellular telephones and personal digital assistants many companies currently provide remote access to offsite users through vpns based on the internet protocol security or ipsec framework which allows remote users to access corporate networks and applications by means of encrypted “tunnels” through the internet vpns are costeffective because they use the internet for lowcost transmission of information while providing remote users with a highly secure connection however a key security risk associated with ipsec vpns is that once remote users are connected they have unrestricted access to all applications and resources within the network   during the past year new vpn technology using the ssl protocol has steadily gained acceptance as a more costeffective solution that is both simpler to deploy and easier to manage than ipsec vpns unlike ipsec vpns ssl vpns do not require customers to purchase and install clientside software on every remote device that accesses the network instead they use the ssl capabilities resident in a remote client’s internet browser to establish and maintain a secure connection between the client and the vpn server this eliminates both the initial cost of distributing and implementing clientside software and the recurring costs of upgrading and maintaining it in addition to providing secure network access ssl technology can also be used to selectively limit access to certain applications and resources within the network depending on the identity of the user because of the improved security and reduced overall costs we believe sslbased solutions will become the dominant method for remote access within the next few years   according to infonetics research’s “vpn and firewall products quarterly worldwide market share and forecasts for 2q03” report the ssl vpn market is expected to grow from 34 million in 2002 to 607 million by 2006 representing a fouryear compounded annual growth rate of approximately 105 5 the f5 solution   we believe our products are superior to those of our competitors in addressing the growing need among enterprises for integrated secure application traffic management   software based products from our inception we have been committed to the belief that the complexity of layer 7 traffic management requires a softwarebased rather than a hardwarebased solution we believe our softwarebased solution for application traffic management and security using commodity hardware provides greatly increased functionality we also believe our products are more costeffective flexible and easily adaptable to today’s constantly changing and increasingly demanding environments than our competitors’ solutions which are primarily hardwarebased in addition our software can be easily ported to commodity hardware platforms manufactured by thirdparty vendors which has enabled us to license the software to our original equipment manufacturer or oem partners who resell it installed on their own products it has also created an opportunity for us to sell versions of our software that run on blade servers manufactured by thirdparty vendors thereby increasing the target market for our software   application awareness one of the most important features of our softwarebased products is their “application awareness” our products are designed using a common architecture called icontrol with a common interface that allows them to communicate with one another and with thirdparty software and devices through our unique open icontrol application programming interface or api thirdparty applications and network devices can take an active role in shaping ip network traffic directing traffic based on exact business requirements specified by our customers for example our icontrol api allows an organization running oracle software which has help desks located in bombay san francisco and london to cause that software to make a realtime request that all email requests for help be directed to a single one of our 3dns devices that has been instructed to redirect the requests to different help desks at different times of the day similarly our bigip device managing traffic to an ecommerce web site could for example be directed to recognize transmissions from preferred customers and route them to a server that will expedite their transactions this “application awareness” capability is one of the most important features of our softwarebased products and serves as a further point of differentiation for our solution in comparison with those offered by our competitors   another key benefit of our softwarebased solution is that it allows the customer to incorporate specific business rules and processes into the software this capability which we call irules is a simple tool that can be used to define how the user wants to direct persist on or filter traffic based on the needs of each application   furthermore our universal inspection engine the core of our application traffic management technology is unique in its ability to inspect ip traffic down to the packet payload level and can direct traffic according to flexible irules specified by the user this “deep packet inspection” technology enables powerful offloading inspection and processing of applicationlevel transactions   integrated traffic management and security solution our application traffic management technology is differentiated from other solutions primarily by its ability to intercept inspect and act on the contents of traffic from virtually every type of ipenabled application this deep packet inspection technology allows us to offer an integrated traffic management and security solution that can detect and prevent many network level attacks   our firepass technology enables us to offer secure remote access through ssl vpns firepass has components that allow remote users to access any application or resource connected to the network including legacy hosts desktops and clientserver applications over the course of the next twelve months we intend to combine our ssl vpn technology with our secure traffic management capabilities providing significant differentiation from our competitors this capability will enable our products to provide comprehensive application security at multigigabit speeds   combined with the sophisticated inspection and control capabilities of our application traffic management technology we believe that firepass technology is an ideal platform for the development of advanced application security gateways that can control access to individual applications and the data and resources they 6 use because our bigip software can examine the entire contents of a transmission it can detect irregularities that might represent a security violation but which may pass undetected through an organization’s firewall and other network security devices as a result we believe that firepass is an ideal platform for the development of technology to protect the integrity of ipbased applications and the data and resources they use in the future we plan to use bigip and firepass to develop a comprehensive security solution that protects network applications from unauthorized access which existing safeguards may fail to prevent 

strategy   our objective is to be the leading provider of secure application traffic management solutions designed to enhance and optimize server availability security and performance key components of our strategy include   offering a complete application security solution and product set we plan to utilize our core technologies from our bigip and firepass products to deliver standalone and integrated systems that protect applications from hostile and inadvertent threats including usertosystem application security and systemtosystem application security problems we believe these solutions will differentiate our products in the security market and provide a unique solution to the problem of vulnerability of missioncritical applications   increasing the addressable market for our products in order to enable significant growth over the next three years we intend to target logical extensions of our traditional traffic management market including the areas of blade server software mobile ip infrastructure which is a mechanism for maintaining transparent network connectivity to mobile hosts web services infrastructure and utility computing and data center virtualization infrastructure in which corporations pay only for the computing resources they use this allows their information technology resources to be allocated on an asneeded basis to meet rapidly changing business demands in addition we plan to enter adjacent markets such as the application security market with our first product offering being an ssl vpn solution   investing in technology to continue to meet customer needs we plan to continue to invest in research and development to provide our customers with complete secure application traffic management and secure remote access solutions our softwarebased platforms are designed to quickly and easily expand the features and functionalities of our products as well as enabling us to develop additional products that address the complex and changing needs of our customers we will continue to use commodity hardware in order to ensure performance and cost competitiveness we also plan to deliver specialized software modules that will allow our customers to purchase software for our platforms as upgrades with specific features based on specific requirements   enhancing the existing channel model we are investing significant resources in order to further develop our indirect sales channels we plan to expand our indirect sales channels through leading industry resellers oems systems integrators internet service providers and other channel partners also we are leveraging our existing channels by delivering application security products including firepass ssl vpns making these channels more productive   continuing to build and expand relationships with strategic icontrol partners we plan to capitalize on our strategic relationships with enterprise software vendors who have created interfaces to our products through our icontrol api these vendors provide us significant leverage in the selling process because they recommend our products to their customers in order to differentiate ourselves further from our competitors we plan to explore opportunities to further embed icontrol into existing and new third party products and to jointly market and sell our solutions to enterprise customers with these key partners   enhancing our brand we plan to continue building brand awareness that positions us as one of the leading providers of secure application traffic management solutions our goal is for the f5 brand to be synonymous with superior performance highquality customer service and ease of use products   our core technology is software for ip application traffic management and secure remote access to ip networks and applications we also manufacture several types of systems which are software and hardware 7 bundled together as an integrated product offering bigip server appliances bigip application switches 3dns controller bigip link controller and firepass ssl vpn servers each incorporating our software with commodity components to provide a complete solution 

  bigip software and systems   our flagship product is the bigip controller for localarea application traffic management bigip software runs on a variety of commodity hardware platforms including ip application switches and server appliances manufactured by us and our oem partners as well as on blade servers manufactured by server vendors such as dell inc fujitsu siemens computers gmbh hewlett packard company international business machines corporation and nec corporation the core of bigip is sophisticated software that manages ip traffic at layer 7 also known as the application layer our bigip application switches also perform layer 23 switching and we believe industryleading layer 4 switching but we believe it is the superior performance and functionality of the bigip layer 7 traffic management software that distinguishes it from competing products sold by cisco systems nortel networks and others in addition bigip has a patented feature known as “cookie persistence” which establishes a link between a user and a specific server and enables the user to return to that server if the connection is broken before a transaction is completed   bigip server appliances were our original products and accounted for 169 of our product revenue for fiscal year 2003 the bigip 520 and 540 server appliances are equipped with intel processors for highspeed layer 47 processing and are designed to accommodate easilyinstalled upgrade cards that provide fast integrated ssl encryption and decryption integrated ssl processing has been an important factor of system sales by offloading ssl processing which requires significant server and computing power from servers to our traffic management systems customers can free up valuable server space for other applications   in september 2001 we introduced our first ip application switch the bigip 5000 in response to customer demand for systems with an increased number of ports allowing them to be connected to many different types of network devices integrated layer 23 switching and ssl processing capability we currently offer the highend bigip 5100 the bigip 2400 midrange product with integrated layer 4 switching on an applicationspecific integrated circuit or asic developed by our hardware team and the bigip 1000 entrylevel switch   3dns and link controller   our other traffic management products include 3dns controller and bigip link controller 3dns allows enterprises with geographically dispersed data centers to direct traffic to a particular data center in accordance with customized business rules or to redirect traffic to an available data center if one of their sites becomes overloaded or is shut down for any reason link controller allows enterprises with more than one internet service provider to manage the use of their available bandwidth to minimize costs while ensuring the highest quality of service 3dns and link controller are sold separately on individual ip application switches and server appliances or bundled with bigip on a single appliance or ip application switch   firepass   firepass systems provide ssl vpn access for remote users of ip networks and any applications connected to those networks from any standard web browser on any device the components of firepass include a dynamic policy engine which manages user authentication and authorization privileges and special components that enable corporations to give remote users controlled access to the full array of applications and resources within the network   our firepass line of ssl vpn servers currently includes the firepass 1000 and the firepass 4000 which support 100 and 1000 concurrent users respectively both support the complete range of firepass software features and offer a comprehensive solution for webbased remote access to corporate applications and desktops 8   enabling technologies   our products also come equipped with our icontrol and icontrol services manager or ism functions which are designed to facilitate the broader use of our products in early 2001 we recognized a growing need for traffic management products that could not only communicate with one another but also with the increasing number and variety of ipenabled enterprise applications being deployed by large organizations at that time we published the icontrol interface in a free software development kit or sdk that allows customers and independent software vendors to modify their programs to communicate with our products the use of icontrol reduces or eliminates the need for human involvement significantly reducing the cost of performing basic network functions and dramatically reducing the likelihood of error adding this extra functionality to their products is attractive to independent software vendors and since the introduction of our icontrol sdk we have formed relationships with dozens of software developers including microsoft corporation oracle corporation bea systems inc international business machines corporation hewlett packard company siebel systems inc and mercury interactive corporation although we do not derive revenue from icontrol itself the sale of icontrolenabled independent software vendor products helps promote and often leads directly to the sale of our other products   icontrol services manager takes advantage of icontrol to provide a single centralized management and operational interface for our devices this feature allows customers with dozens or hundreds of our products to upgrade or modify the software on those products simultaneously from a single console this lowers the cost and simplifies the task of deploying managing and maintaining our products and reduces the likelihood of error when blanket changes are implemented product development   our future success depends on our ability to maintain technology leadership in secure application traffic management by constantly improving our products and by developing new products to meet the changing needs of our customers our product development group which is divided along product lines employs a standard process for the development documentation and quality control of software and systems that is designed to meet these goals we are currently focused on developing enhancements to our existing traffic management and ssl vpn products in order to deliver greater functionality and performance we are also developing an integrated application security gateway which will combine our security and traffic management technologies in order to deliver a network device that protects applications from hostile attacks by ensuring usertosystem application security and systemtosystem application security the application security gateway will provide comprehensive application security   in order to advance our product development we also engage in technology partnerships with software and component manufacturers that allow us to integrate industrystandard technology with our own products during the past two years we have had a close working relationship with broadcom corporation which manufactures the layer 23 switch chips and ssl processors used in our family of application switches   our principal software engineering group which develops our application traffic management technology is located in our headquarters in seattle washington our firepass product development team which includes the original developers of the technology is located in san jose california our hardware engineering group is located in spokane washington members of these teams collaborate closely with one another on specific projects   during the fiscal years ended september 30 2003 2002 and 2001 we had research and product development expenses of 192 million 180 million and 174 million respectively customers   we have a globally diversified base of customers consisting primarily of large enterprises although we do not target specific vertical markets enterprise customers in financial services manufacturing transportation and mobile telecommunications currently make up the largest percentage of our customer base the other significant components of our customer base are internet service providers internet hosting companies and 9 internet commerce companies in fiscal year 2003 international sales represented 349 of our net revenues see note 14 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding our revenues by geographic area 

  prior to fiscal year 2001 our enduser customer base was comprised primarily of internet service providers internet hosting companies and internet startups engaged in ecommerce starting in the first half of fiscal year 2001 as demand from those customers weakened we successfully refocused our marketing and sales efforts on large enterprises which currently account for the majority of our revenue without any material adverse effect on our revenues consistent with our goal of building a strong channel sales model the majority of our revenue is generated by sales though our distributors valueadded resellers and systems integrators   for fiscal year 2003 sales to ingram micro inc one of our distributors represented 126 of our revenues our agreement with ingram micro is a standard nonexclusive distribution agreement that renews automatically on an annual basis and is terminable by either party with 30 days’ prior written notice the agreement grants ingram micro the right to distribute our products to resellers in north america and certain other territories internationally with no minimum purchase requirements sales and marketing   sales   we sell our software systems and services to large enterprise customers through a variety of channels including oems distributors valueadded resellers and systems integrators a substantial amount of our revenue for fiscal year 2003 was derived from these channel sales we also sell our products and services to major accounts through our own direct sales force in most cases service contracts are negotiated directly with the customer typically our agreements with our channel partners are not exclusive and do not prevent them from selling competitive products these agreements typically have terms of one year with no obligation to renew and typically do not provide for exclusive sales territories or minimum purchase requirements   direct sales our field sales personnel are located in major cities throughout north america europe and the asia pacific region the inside sales team generates and qualifies leads for regional sales managers and helps manage accounts by serving as a liaison between the field and internal corporate resources we sell our products directly to a limited group of customers primarily oems including dell inc fujitsu siemens computers gmbh hewlett packard company international business machines corporation and nec corporation and certain large enterprise endusers whose accounts are managed by our major account services team field systems engineers also support our regional sales managers by participating in joint sales calls and providing presale technical resources as needed the majority of our field sales personnel work closely with our channel partners to assist them in selling our products to their customers as the bulk of our sales are made through distributors or valueadded resellers   distributor and valueadded reseller relationships we have established relationships with large national and international distributors local and specialized distributors and valueadded resellers the distributors sell our products and the valueadded resellers not only sell our products but also assist their customers in network design installation and testing our primary distributor relationships include ingram micro inc in north america and in certain territories internationally and our primary valueadded reseller relationships include milestone systems inc   systems integrators we also market our products through strategic relationships we have with systems integrators which design and install networks that incorporate our systems systems integrators typically do not purchase and resell equipment to their customers instead they typically recommend equipment to their customers for use in the systems they design and install we currently have relationships with a number of systems integrators including electronic data systems corporation   marketing   the cornerstone of our marketing strategy is the establishment of strong partnerships with large prominent companies that are leaders in their respective industries by partnering with these firms we have 10 been able to gain visibility with prospective customers and access to large accounts that we would not have been able to achieve on our own currently we have three principal types of marketing partnerships that overlap to varying degrees with our sales channel partnerships these include 

  icontrol partnerships we have established relationships with various independent software vendors who have adapted their applications to interact with our products via the icontrol interface icontrol enhances the functionality of third party applications by enabling them to control the network in an automated way based on business policies and rules associated with the application as a result customers who purchase icontrolenabled applications have an incentive to purchase our products in order to take advantage of the enhanced functionality made possible through our technical cooperation   blade server relationships we have relationships with various system vendors dell inc fujitsu siemens computers gmbh hewlett packard company international business machines corporation and nec corporation to market our bigip blade controller software for use on their blade server systems market focus and strategy are different for each relationship in some of these relationships vendors or their channel partners resell blade controller software to their customers   oem partnership with dell inc we license our software to dell which resells it on its own line of traffic management products in conjunction with this arrangement we participate in joint marketing programs with dell   we engage in a number of marketing programs and initiatives aimed at promoting our brand and creating market awareness of our technology and products these include actively participating in industry trade shows and briefing industry analysts and members of the trade press on our latest products and on new business and technology partnerships in addition we market our products to chief information officers and other information technology professionals through targeted advertising direct mail and highprofile web events backlog   our backlog represents orders confirmed with a purchase order for products to be shipped generally within 90 days to customers with approved credit status orders are subject to cancellation rescheduling by customers or product specification changes by the customers although we believe that the backlog orders are firm purchase orders may be cancelled by the customer prior to shipment without significant penalty for this reason we believe that our backlog at any given date is not a reliable indicator of future revenues customer service and technical support   our ability to provide consistent highquality customer service and technical support is a key factor in attracting and retaining customers prior to the installation of our products our services personnel work with customers to analyze their network needs and determine the best way to deploy our products and configure product features and functions to meet those needs our services personnel also provide onsite installation and training services to help customers make optimal use of product features and functions installation generally occurs within 30 days of product shipment to the customer   at the time of purchase customers typically purchase a oneyear maintenance contract renewable annually which entitles them to an array of services provided by our technical support team maintenance services provided under the contract include online updates software error correction releases ask f5 described below and remote support through a 24 hours a day 7 days a week help desk although not all service contracts entitle a customer to roundtheclock call center support updates to our software are only available to customers with a current maintenance contract our technical support team also offers seminars and training classes for customers on the configuration and use of products including local and wide area network system administration and management in addition we have a professional services team able to provide a full range of feebased consulting services including comprehensive network management documentation and performance analysis and capacity planning to assist in predicting future network requirements 11   we also offer as part of our maintenance service an online automated selfhelp customer support function called ask f5 that allows customers to answer many commonly asked questions without having to call our support desk this allows the customer to rapidly address issues and questions while significantly reducing the number of calls to our support desk this enables us to provide comprehensive customer support while keeping our support related expenses at a manageable consistent level manufacturing   we outsource the manufacturing of our preconfigured hardware platforms to a contract manufacturer solectron corporation which assembles each product to our specifications hardware platforms for our traffic management products consist primarily of a commodity computing platform custom and commodity asics a rackmount enclosure system and a customdesigned front panel solectron also installs our application traffic management software onto these hardware platforms and conducts functionality testing quality assurance and documentation control prior to shipping our products   our agreement with solectron allows them to procure component inventory on our behalf based upon a rolling production forecast subcontractors supply solectron with standard parts and components for our products based on our production forecast we are contractually obligated to purchase component inventory that our contract manufacturer procures in accordance with the forecast unless we give notice of order cancellation in advance of applicable lead times for any completed product inventory carried by solectron beyond 30 days solectron will charge us a monthly carrying fee of 15 alternatively we have the option to purchase inventory held by solectron beyond 30 days to avoid incurring related carrying charges as protection against component shortages and to provide replacement parts for our service teams we also stock limited supplies of certain key components for our products   in addition we obtain all of the layer 23 switch chips and the ssl processors used in our family of application switches from broadcom corporation we purchase components from broadcom on a purchase order basis with pricing updated at agreed upon intervals certain products purchased from broadcom were designed with our input but are not exclusive to us we also designed a layer 4 asic which is used in one of our products and is manufactured for us by a contract semiconductor foundry competition   our principal competitors in the traffic management market are cisco systems inc and nortel networks corporation other competitors in this market include foundry networks inc netscaler inc and radware ltd   cisco systems has a product set similar to ours and holds the largest share of the market cisco has a longer operating history and significantly greater financial technical marketing and other resources than we do cisco also has a more extensive customer base and broader customer relationships including relationships with many of our current and potential customers in addition cisco has large wellestablished worldwide customer support and professional services organizations and a more extensive direct sales force and sales channels   like cisco nortel has a product set similar to ours and has a longer operating history greater resources a larger customer base and a larger sales and service organization whereas cisco has historically focused on large corporate enterprise customers nortel has primarily focused on telecommunications and internet service provider customers   because of our relatively smaller size market presence and resources cisco nortel and other larger competitors may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements there is also the possibility that these companies may adopt aggressive pricing policies to gain market share as a result our competitors pose a serious competitive threat that could undermine our ability to win new customers and maintain our existing customer base   our most prominent competitors in the ssl vpn market are aventail corporation neoteris inc and safeweb inc netscreen technologies inc recently announced its acquisition of neoteris and symantec 12 corp recently announced its acquisition of safeweb with both moves designed to allow the buyer to enter the ssl vpn market nokia corporation and nortel networks corporation have also recently introduced ssl vpn products while we believe our firepass products are superior to their offerings some of our competitors have resources and distribution channels that are much larger than ours and could give them a significant competitive advantage in the ssl vpn market we currently compete with nortel in the layer 47 traffic management market and nokia resells our layer 47 products in the near term we do not anticipate that our entry into the ssl vpn market will affect nokia’s resale of our layer 47 products 

  ssl vpns are a potential replacement for ipsec vpns the most widely deployed solution for secure remote access today the current leaders in the ipsec vpn market are check point software technologies ltd and netscreen both of which are larger and betterknown vendors than us intellectual property   we rely on a combination of patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights we have obtained three patents in the united states and have applications pending for various aspects of our technology our future success depends in part on our ability to protect our proprietary rights to the technologies used in our principal products despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use trade secrets or other information that we regard as proprietary in addition the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights as fully as do the laws of the united states we cannot assure you that any issued patent will preserve our proprietary position or that competitors or others will not develop technologies similar to or superior to our technology our failure to enforce and protect our intellectual property rights could harm our business operating results and financial condition   in addition to our own proprietary software we incorporate software licensed from several thirdparty sources into our products these licenses generally renew automatically on an annual basis we believe that alternative technologies for this licensed software are available both domestically and internationally   f5 f5 networks bigip 3dns icontrol irules and firepass are our trademarks or registered trademarks oracle financials bea weblogic and siebel salesforce automation are trademarks of oracle corporation bea systems inc and siebel systems inc respectively employees   as of september 30 2003 we employed 507 fulltime persons including 145 in product development 211 in sales and marketing 84 in professional services and technical support and 67 in finance administration and operations none of our employees is represented by a labor union we have experienced no work stoppages and believe that our employee relations are good

server appliances provides secure user access to corporate networks and individual applications through any standard web browser our unique icontrol architecture enables our products to communicate with one another in the network and ensure optimal throughput of traffic and also allows them to be integrated with third party products including enterprise applications this facilitates the automation of repetitive processes and allows the customer to optimize applications on their networks thereby saving them time and money as components of an integrated solution our products address many elements required for successful internet and intranet business applications including high availability high performance intelligent load balancing streamlined manageability remote access to corporate networks and network and application security our solution for application traffic management and security is softwarebased which differentiates us from our competitors whose solutions are largely hardwarebased we believe this differentiation enables us to offer our customers greater flexibility costeffectiveness and adaptability in response to today’s rapidly changing environment   enterprise customers fortune 1000 or business week global 1000 companies in financial services manufacturing transportation and mobile telecommunications make up the largest percentage of our customer base we market and sell our products primarily through indirect sales channels in north america europe and the asia pacific region and to some direct customer accounts in north america we have subsidiaries or branch offices in australia canada china france germany hong kong japan the netherlands singapore south korea spain taiwan thailand and the united kingdom   in july 2003 we acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of uroam inc or uroam for 250 million in cash we also incurred 24 million of direct transaction costs for a net purchase price of 274 million we hired substantially all of uroam’s 20 employees consisting of product development sales and service personnel uroam’s family of firepass servers is a comprehensive remote access product set that enables users to access applications in a secure fashion using technology based on the secure sockets layer or ssl standard we believe firepass provides a security solution that is easier to manage and use and is more secure than existing virtual private network or vpn solutions allowing customers to realize significant cost savings for secure remote access to any application the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of uroam will allow us to quickly enter the ssl vpn market broaden our customer base and augment our existing product line 3   we were incorporated on

as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with the securities and exchange commission industry background   as a result of the internet’s capabilities it has become a fundamental tool for commerce and communications since the late 1990’s businesses have responded to the power flexibility and economy of the internet by deploying new internet protocol or ip based applications upgrading their clientserver applications to new ipenabled versions and enabling existing applications for use over the internet ip is a communications language that is used for transmitting data over the internet during the next several years we believe this process of deploying ipenabled applications will accelerate as web services enable businesses to build applications quickly and easily by integrating software modules available from many different sources web services allow businesses to combine functions of existing applications and processes to create new applications and functionality operating over the internet and beyond the corporate firewall the purpose of web services is to enable applications to interact with each other more smoothly reducing inefficiencies associated with human intervention a fullyintegrated web servicesenabled computing network would allow personal computers servers handheld devices programs applications and network equipment to work together directly to generate more efficient data flow and application development and use in addition we believe that the growth of internet usage will continue to be driven by new applications such as voice over ip or voip increased penetration of broadband internet access enabling the remote use of more applications and the increasing popularity of mobile internet access through wireless devices such as cellular telephones personal digital assistants and notebook computers   current traffic management products are designed primarily to manage web traffic however few products are equipped with the functionality and flexibility to securely manage the full range of ipenabled applications such as oracle financials bea weblogic and siebel sales force automation   internet architecture   the open systems interconnect reference model or osi model is the framework that describes and defines how networked systems communicate with one another the osi model divides network functions into seven layers and specifies how the layers should interact to enable interoperability between the various users these interoperability standards have been designed to allow all parts of the network to work together regardless of the different hardware and software components ip requires all data transmitted across the internet to be divided into packets prior to its transmission and reassembled at its destination prior to transmission each packet of data is automatically given a header that identifies the source and destination of the packet this header information is used in the osi model for the purposes of identifying routing and sequencing data packets and is stripped from the data upon arrival at its destination   layer 47 traffic management   layers 2 and 3 of the osi model primarily perform standardized repetitive tasks such as ensuring that packets of information sent over the internet arrive at the destination to which they are addressed and reassembling them in the correct sequence unlike layers 2 and 3 layers 47 are complex and variable and must support enduser applications and processes on a wide variety of platforms and devices for example layer 7 which encompasses the functions of layers 5 and 6 enables email directory lookup and the transfer of files between otherwise incompatible systems   while traditional layer 23 switching devices are used primarily to ensure correct delivery of packets of information there is an increasing need for layer 7 technology that can read the entire contents of a packetized transmission and make intelligent decisions based on a dynamic set of business rules about how to 4 handle the transmission and where to route it to ensure the availability and optimal performance of applications servers and the network additionally layer 23 as well as layer 4 switching devices are primarily hardwarebased and are optimized for speed at the expense of flexibility while most manufacturers of layer 7 switching devices have also opted for the traditional costly hardwarebased solutions this limits the ability of their products to adapt to the rapidly changing requirements of layer 7 traffic management needed for common enduser applications today 

  according to the “ethernet switch report — 5year forecast” prepared by dell’oro group the traditional layer 47 traffic management market is expected to grow from 432 million in 2002 to 870 million in 2007 representing a fiveyear compounded annual growth rate of approximately 15 additional emerging growth markets for layer 47 traffic management include blade servers mobile ip and web services a blade server is a thin modular electronic circuit board intended for a single dedicated application such as serving web pages or server load balancing that can be easily inserted into a spacesaving chassis with many similar blade servers blade servers loaded into chassis are designed to consume less energy and require considerably less space than conventional servers   growth in demand for secure traffic management   as internet traffic and the use of ipenabled applications have increased the demands placed on layer 7 have also increased and so has the demand for integrated effective layer 7 traffic management solutions corporations are becoming more reliant on highly sophisticated ipenabled applications both for their internal operations and for interactions with external customers and partners the need to guarantee the security of electronic information and transactions has led to the emergence of ssl encryption as the standard for secure ipenabled traffic during the interaction between a user and a financial application for example data sent from the user to the server is typically encrypted by the user’s web browser and decrypted by the server and this process is reversed for data sent back to the user the use of ssl has continued to grow with the proliferation of webbased applications that require secure transactions increases in the number and sophistication of web attacks and the damage caused by such attacks are also driving demand for more effective security solutions   ssl is also the core of new technology that addresses the growing need for corporations to provide secure connectivity for the rapidly increasing number of users who access corporate networks and applications from remote locations using a variety of devices ranging from home personal computers and laptops to cellular telephones and personal digital assistants many companies currently provide remote access to offsite users through vpns based on the internet protocol security or ipsec framework which allows remote users to access corporate networks and applications by means of encrypted “tunnels” through the internet vpns are costeffective because they use the internet for lowcost transmission of information while providing remote users with a highly secure connection however a key security risk associated with ipsec vpns is that once remote users are connected they have unrestricted access to all applications and resources within the network   during the past year new vpn technology using the ssl protocol has steadily gained acceptance as a more costeffective solution that is both simpler to deploy and easier to manage than ipsec vpns unlike ipsec vpns ssl vpns do not require customers to purchase and install clientside software on every remote device that accesses the network instead they use the ssl capabilities resident in a remote client’s internet browser to establish and maintain a secure connection between the client and the vpn server this eliminates both the initial cost of distributing and implementing clientside software and the recurring costs of upgrading and maintaining it in addition to providing secure network access ssl technology can also be used to selectively limit access to certain applications and resources within the network depending on the identity of the user because of the improved security and reduced overall costs we believe sslbased solutions will become the dominant method for remote access within the next few years   according to infonetics research’s “vpn and firewall products quarterly worldwide market share and forecasts for 2q03” report the ssl vpn market is expected to grow from 34 million in 2002 to 607 million by 2006 representing a fouryear compounded annual growth rate of approximately 105 5 the f5 solution   we believe our products are superior to those of our competitors in addressing the growing need among enterprises for integrated secure application traffic management   software based products from our inception we have been committed to the belief that the complexity of layer 7 traffic management requires a softwarebased rather than a hardwarebased solution we believe our softwarebased solution for application traffic management and security using commodity hardware provides greatly increased functionality we also believe our products are more costeffective flexible and easily adaptable to today’s constantly changing and increasingly demanding environments than our competitors’ solutions which are primarily hardwarebased in addition our software can be easily ported to commodity hardware platforms manufactured by thirdparty vendors which has enabled us to license the software to our original equipment manufacturer or oem partners who resell it installed on their own products it has also created an opportunity for us to sell versions of our software that run on blade servers manufactured by thirdparty vendors thereby increasing the target market for our software   application awareness one of the most important features of our softwarebased products is their “application awareness” our products are designed using a common architecture called icontrol with a common interface that allows them to communicate with one another and with thirdparty software and devices through our unique open icontrol application programming interface or api thirdparty applications and network devices can take an active role in shaping ip network traffic directing traffic based on exact business requirements specified by our customers for example our icontrol api allows an organization running oracle software which has help desks located in bombay san francisco and london to cause that software to make a realtime request that all email requests for help be directed to a single one of our 3dns devices that has been instructed to redirect the requests to different help desks at different times of the day similarly our bigip device managing traffic to an ecommerce web site could for example be directed to recognize transmissions from preferred customers and route them to a server that will expedite their transactions this “application awareness” capability is one of the most important features of our softwarebased products and serves as a further point of differentiation for our solution in comparison with those offered by our competitors   another key benefit of our softwarebased solution is that it allows the customer to incorporate specific business rules and processes into the software this capability which we call irules is a simple tool that can be used to define how the user wants to direct persist on or filter traffic based on the needs of each application   furthermore our universal inspection engine the core of our application traffic management technology is unique in its ability to inspect ip traffic down to the packet payload level and can direct traffic according to flexible irules specified by the user this “deep packet inspection” technology enables powerful offloading inspection and processing of applicationlevel transactions   integrated traffic management and security solution our application traffic management technology is differentiated from other solutions primarily by its ability to intercept inspect and act on the contents of traffic from virtually every type of ipenabled application this deep packet inspection technology allows us to offer an integrated traffic management and security solution that can detect and prevent many network level attacks   our firepass technology enables us to offer secure remote access through ssl vpns firepass has components that allow remote users to access any application or resource connected to the network including legacy hosts desktops and clientserver applications over the course of the next twelve months we intend to combine our ssl vpn technology with our secure traffic management capabilities providing significant differentiation from our competitors this capability will enable our products to provide comprehensive application security at multigigabit speeds   combined with the sophisticated inspection and control capabilities of our application traffic management technology we believe that firepass technology is an ideal platform for the development of advanced application security gateways that can control access to individual applications and the data and resources they 6 use because our bigip software can examine the entire contents of a transmission it can detect irregularities that might represent a security violation but which may pass undetected through an organization’s firewall and other network security devices as a result we believe that firepass is an ideal platform for the development of technology to protect the integrity of ipbased applications and the data and resources they use in the future we plan to use bigip and firepass to develop a comprehensive security solution that protects network applications from unauthorized access which existing safeguards may fail to prevent 

strategy   our objective is to be the leading provider of secure application traffic management solutions designed to enhance and optimize server availability security and performance key components of our strategy include   offering a complete application security solution and product set we plan to utilize our core technologies from our bigip and firepass products to deliver standalone and integrated systems that protect applications from hostile and inadvertent threats including usertosystem application security and systemtosystem application security problems we believe these solutions will differentiate our products in the security market and provide a unique solution to the problem of vulnerability of missioncritical applications   increasing the addressable market for our products in order to enable significant growth over the next three years we intend to target logical extensions of our traditional traffic management market including the areas of blade server software mobile ip infrastructure which is a mechanism for maintaining transparent network connectivity to mobile hosts web services infrastructure and utility computing and data center virtualization infrastructure in which corporations pay only for the computing resources they use this allows their information technology resources to be allocated on an asneeded basis to meet rapidly changing business demands in addition we plan to enter adjacent markets such as the application security market with our first product offering being an ssl vpn solution   investing in technology to continue to meet customer needs we plan to continue to invest in research and development to provide our customers with complete secure application traffic management and secure remote access solutions our softwarebased platforms are designed to quickly and easily expand the features and functionalities of our products as well as enabling us to develop additional products that address the complex and changing needs of our customers we will continue to use commodity hardware in order to ensure performance and cost competitiveness we also plan to deliver specialized software modules that will allow our customers to purchase software for our platforms as upgrades with specific features based on specific requirements   enhancing the existing channel model we are investing significant resources in order to further develop our indirect sales channels we plan to expand our indirect sales channels through leading industry resellers oems systems integrators internet service providers and other channel partners also we are leveraging our existing channels by delivering application security products including firepass ssl vpns making these channels more productive   continuing to build and expand relationships with strategic icontrol partners we plan to capitalize on our strategic relationships with enterprise software vendors who have created interfaces to our products through our icontrol api these vendors provide us significant leverage in the selling process because they recommend our products to their customers in order to differentiate ourselves further from our competitors we plan to explore opportunities to further embed icontrol into existing and new third party products and to jointly market and sell our solutions to enterprise customers with these key partners   enhancing our brand we plan to continue building brand awareness that positions us as one of the leading providers of secure application traffic management solutions our goal is for the f5 brand to be synonymous with superior performance highquality customer service and ease of use products   our core technology is software for ip application traffic management and secure remote access to ip networks and applications we also manufacture several types of systems which are software and hardware 7 bundled together as an integrated product offering bigip server appliances bigip application switches 3dns controller bigip link controller and firepass ssl vpn servers each incorporating our software with commodity components to provide a complete solution 

  bigip software and systems   our flagship product is the bigip controller for localarea application traffic management bigip software runs on a variety of commodity hardware platforms including ip application switches and server appliances manufactured by us and our oem partners as well as on blade servers manufactured by server vendors such as dell inc fujitsu siemens computers gmbh hewlett packard company international business machines corporation and nec corporation the core of bigip is sophisticated software that manages ip traffic at layer 7 also known as the application layer our bigip application switches also perform layer 23 switching and we believe industryleading layer 4 switching but we believe it is the superior performance and functionality of the bigip layer 7 traffic management software that distinguishes it from competing products sold by cisco systems nortel networks and others in addition bigip has a patented feature known as “cookie persistence” which establishes a link between a user and a specific server and enables the user to return to that server if the connection is broken before a transaction is completed   bigip server appliances were our original products and accounted for 169 of our product revenue for fiscal year 2003 the bigip 520 and 540 server appliances are equipped with intel processors for highspeed layer 47 processing and are designed to accommodate easilyinstalled upgrade cards that provide fast integrated ssl encryption and decryption integrated ssl processing has been an important factor of system sales by offloading ssl processing which requires significant server and computing power from servers to our traffic management systems customers can free up valuable server space for other applications   in september 2001 we introduced our first ip application switch the bigip 5000 in response to customer demand for systems with an increased number of ports allowing them to be connected to many different types of network devices integrated layer 23 switching and ssl processing capability we currently offer the highend bigip 5100 the bigip 2400 midrange product with integrated layer 4 switching on an applicationspecific integrated circuit or asic developed by our hardware team and the bigip 1000 entrylevel switch   3dns and link controller   our other traffic management products include 3dns controller and bigip link controller 3dns allows enterprises with geographically dispersed data centers to direct traffic to a particular data center in accordance with customized business rules or to redirect traffic to an available data center if one of their sites becomes overloaded or is shut down for any reason link controller allows enterprises with more than one internet service provider to manage the use of their available bandwidth to minimize costs while ensuring the highest quality of service 3dns and link controller are sold separately on individual ip application switches and server appliances or bundled with bigip on a single appliance or ip application switch   firepass   firepass systems provide ssl vpn access for remote users of ip networks and any applications connected to those networks from any standard web browser on any device the components of firepass include a dynamic policy engine which manages user authentication and authorization privileges and special components that enable corporations to give remote users controlled access to the full array of applications and resources within the network   our firepass line of ssl vpn servers currently includes the firepass 1000 and the firepass 4000 which support 100 and 1000 concurrent users respectively both support the complete range of firepass software features and offer a comprehensive solution for webbased remote access to corporate applications and desktops 8   enabling technologies   our products also come equipped with our icontrol and icontrol services manager or ism functions which are designed to facilitate the broader use of our products in early 2001 we recognized a growing need for traffic management products that could not only communicate with one another but also with the increasing number and variety of ipenabled enterprise applications being deployed by large organizations at that time we published the icontrol interface in a free software development kit or sdk that allows customers and independent software vendors to modify their programs to communicate with our products the use of icontrol reduces or eliminates the need for human involvement significantly reducing the cost of performing basic network functions and dramatically reducing the likelihood of error adding this extra functionality to their products is attractive to independent software vendors and since the introduction of our icontrol sdk we have formed relationships with dozens of software developers including microsoft corporation oracle corporation bea systems inc international business machines corporation hewlett packard company siebel systems inc and mercury interactive corporation although we do not derive revenue from icontrol itself the sale of icontrolenabled independent software vendor products helps promote and often leads directly to the sale of our other products   icontrol services manager takes advantage of icontrol to provide a single centralized management and operational interface for our devices this feature allows customers with dozens or hundreds of our products to upgrade or modify the software on those products simultaneously from a single console this lowers the cost and simplifies the task of deploying managing and maintaining our products and reduces the likelihood of error when blanket changes are implemented product development   our future success depends on our ability to maintain technology leadership in secure application traffic management by constantly improving our products and by developing new products to meet the changing needs of our customers our product development group which is divided along product lines employs a standard process for the development documentation and quality control of software and systems that is designed to meet these goals we are currently focused on developing enhancements to our existing traffic management and ssl vpn products in order to deliver greater functionality and performance we are also developing an integrated application security gateway which will combine our security and traffic management technologies in order to deliver a network device that protects applications from hostile attacks by ensuring usertosystem application security and systemtosystem application security the application security gateway will provide comprehensive application security   in order to advance our product development we also engage in technology partnerships with software and component manufacturers that allow us to integrate industrystandard technology with our own products during the past two years we have had a close working relationship with broadcom corporation which manufactures the layer 23 switch chips and ssl processors used in our family of application switches   our principal software engineering group which develops our application traffic management technology is located in our headquarters in seattle washington our firepass product development team which includes the original developers of the technology is located in san jose california our hardware engineering group is located in spokane washington members of these teams collaborate closely with one another on specific projects   during the fiscal years ended september 30 2003 2002 and 2001 we had research and product development expenses of 192 million 180 million and 174 million respectively customers   we have a globally diversified base of customers consisting primarily of large enterprises although we do not target specific vertical markets enterprise customers in financial services manufacturing transportation and mobile telecommunications currently make up the largest percentage of our customer base the other significant components of our customer base are internet service providers internet hosting companies and 9 internet commerce companies in fiscal year 2003 international sales represented 349 of our net revenues see note 14 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding our revenues by geographic area 

  prior to fiscal year 2001 our enduser customer base was comprised primarily of internet service providers internet hosting companies and internet startups engaged in ecommerce starting in the first half of fiscal year 2001 as demand from those customers weakened we successfully refocused our marketing and sales efforts on large enterprises which currently account for the majority of our revenue without any material adverse effect on our revenues consistent with our goal of building a strong channel sales model the majority of our revenue is generated by sales though our distributors valueadded resellers and systems integrators   for fiscal year 2003 sales to ingram micro inc one of our distributors represented 126 of our revenues our agreement with ingram micro is a standard nonexclusive distribution agreement that renews automatically on an annual basis and is terminable by either party with 30 days’ prior written notice the agreement grants ingram micro the right to distribute our products to resellers in north america and certain other territories internationally with no minimum purchase requirements sales and marketing   sales   we sell our software systems and services to large enterprise customers through a variety of channels including oems distributors valueadded resellers and systems integrators a substantial amount of our revenue for fiscal year 2003 was derived from these channel sales we also sell our products and services to major accounts through our own direct sales force in most cases service contracts are negotiated directly with the customer typically our agreements with our channel partners are not exclusive and do not prevent them from selling competitive products these agreements typically have terms of one year with no obligation to renew and typically do not provide for exclusive sales territories or minimum purchase requirements   direct sales our field sales personnel are located in major cities throughout north america europe and the asia pacific region the inside sales team generates and qualifies leads for regional sales managers and helps manage accounts by serving as a liaison between the field and internal corporate resources we sell our products directly to a limited group of customers primarily oems including dell inc fujitsu siemens computers gmbh hewlett packard company international business machines corporation and nec corporation and certain large enterprise endusers whose accounts are managed by our major account services team field systems engineers also support our regional sales managers by participating in joint sales calls and providing presale technical resources as needed the majority of our field sales personnel work closely with our channel partners to assist them in selling our products to their customers as the bulk of our sales are made through distributors or valueadded resellers   distributor and valueadded reseller relationships we have established relationships with large national and international distributors local and specialized distributors and valueadded resellers the distributors sell our products and the valueadded resellers not only sell our products but also assist their customers in network design installation and testing our primary distributor relationships include ingram micro inc in north america and in certain territories internationally and our primary valueadded reseller relationships include milestone systems inc   systems integrators we also market our products through strategic relationships we have with systems integrators which design and install networks that incorporate our systems systems integrators typically do not purchase and resell equipment to their customers instead they typically recommend equipment to their customers for use in the systems they design and install we currently have relationships with a number of systems integrators including electronic data systems corporation   marketing   the cornerstone of our marketing strategy is the establishment of strong partnerships with large prominent companies that are leaders in their respective industries by partnering with these firms we have 10 been able to gain visibility with prospective customers and access to large accounts that we would not have been able to achieve on our own currently we have three principal types of marketing partnerships that overlap to varying degrees with our sales channel partnerships these include 

  icontrol partnerships we have established relationships with various independent software vendors who have adapted their applications to interact with our products via the icontrol interface icontrol enhances the functionality of third party applications by enabling them to control the network in an automated way based on business policies and rules associated with the application as a result customers who purchase icontrolenabled applications have an incentive to purchase our products in order to take advantage of the enhanced functionality made possible through our technical cooperation   blade server relationships we have relationships with various system vendors dell inc fujitsu siemens computers gmbh hewlett packard company international business machines corporation and nec corporation to market our bigip blade controller software for use on their blade server systems market focus and strategy are different for each relationship in some of these relationships vendors or their channel partners resell blade controller software to their customers   oem partnership with dell inc we license our software to dell which resells it on its own line of traffic management products in conjunction with this arrangement we participate in joint marketing programs with dell   we engage in a number of marketing programs and initiatives aimed at promoting our brand and creating market awareness of our technology and products these include actively participating in industry trade shows and briefing industry analysts and members of the trade press on our latest products and on new business and technology partnerships in addition we market our products to chief information officers and other information technology professionals through targeted advertising direct mail and highprofile web events backlog   our backlog represents orders confirmed with a purchase order for products to be shipped generally within 90 days to customers with approved credit status orders are subject to cancellation rescheduling by customers or product specification changes by the customers although we believe that the backlog orders are firm purchase orders may be cancelled by the customer prior to shipment without significant penalty for this reason we believe that our backlog at any given date is not a reliable indicator of future revenues customer service and technical support   our ability to provide consistent highquality customer service and technical support is a key factor in attracting and retaining customers prior to the installation of our products our services personnel work with customers to analyze their network needs and determine the best way to deploy our products and configure product features and functions to meet those needs our services personnel also provide onsite installation and training services to help customers make optimal use of product features and functions installation generally occurs within 30 days of product shipment to the customer   at the time of purchase customers typically purchase a oneyear maintenance contract renewable annually which entitles them to an array of services provided by our technical support team maintenance services provided under the contract include online updates software error correction releases ask f5 described below and remote support through a 24 hours a day 7 days a week help desk although not all service contracts entitle a customer to roundtheclock call center support updates to our software are only available to customers with a current maintenance contract our technical support team also offers seminars and training classes for customers on the configuration and use of products including local and wide area network system administration and management in addition we have a professional services team able to provide a full range of feebased consulting services including comprehensive network management documentation and performance analysis and capacity planning to assist in predicting future network requirements 11   we also offer as part of our maintenance service an online automated selfhelp customer support function called ask f5 that allows customers to answer many commonly asked questions without having to call our support desk this allows the customer to rapidly address issues and questions while significantly reducing the number of calls to our support desk this enables us to provide comprehensive customer support while keeping our support related expenses at a manageable consistent level manufacturing   we outsource the manufacturing of our preconfigured hardware platforms to a contract manufacturer solectron corporation which assembles each product to our specifications hardware platforms for our traffic management products consist primarily of a commodity computing platform custom and commodity asics a rackmount enclosure system and a customdesigned front panel solectron also installs our application traffic management software onto these hardware platforms and conducts functionality testing quality assurance and documentation control prior to shipping our products   our agreement with solectron allows them to procure component inventory on our behalf based upon a rolling production forecast subcontractors supply solectron with standard parts and components for our products based on our production forecast we are contractually obligated to purchase component inventory that our contract manufacturer procures in accordance with the forecast unless we give notice of order cancellation in advance of applicable lead times for any completed product inventory carried by solectron beyond 30 days solectron will charge us a monthly carrying fee of 15 alternatively we have the option to purchase inventory held by solectron beyond 30 days to avoid incurring related carrying charges as protection against component shortages and to provide replacement parts for our service teams we also stock limited supplies of certain key components for our products   in addition we obtain all of the layer 23 switch chips and the ssl processors used in our family of application switches from broadcom corporation we purchase components from broadcom on a purchase order basis with pricing updated at agreed upon intervals certain products purchased from broadcom were designed with our input but are not exclusive to us we also designed a layer 4 asic which is used in one of our products and is manufactured for us by a contract semiconductor foundry competition   our principal competitors in the traffic management market are cisco systems inc and nortel networks corporation other competitors in this market include foundry networks inc netscaler inc and radware ltd   cisco systems has a product set similar to ours and holds the largest share of the market cisco has a longer operating history and significantly greater financial technical marketing and other resources than we do cisco also has a more extensive customer base and broader customer relationships including relationships with many of our current and potential customers in addition cisco has large wellestablished worldwide customer support and professional services organizations and a more extensive direct sales force and sales channels   like cisco nortel has a product set similar to ours and has a longer operating history greater resources a larger customer base and a larger sales and service organization whereas cisco has historically focused on large corporate enterprise customers nortel has primarily focused on telecommunications and internet service provider customers   because of our relatively smaller size market presence and resources cisco nortel and other larger competitors may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements there is also the possibility that these companies may adopt aggressive pricing policies to gain market share as a result our competitors pose a serious competitive threat that could undermine our ability to win new customers and maintain our existing customer base   our most prominent competitors in the ssl vpn market are aventail corporation neoteris inc and safeweb inc netscreen technologies inc recently announced its acquisition of neoteris and symantec 12 corp recently announced its acquisition of safeweb with both moves designed to allow the buyer to enter the ssl vpn market nokia corporation and nortel networks corporation have also recently introduced ssl vpn products while we believe our firepass products are superior to their offerings some of our competitors have resources and distribution channels that are much larger than ours and could give them a significant competitive advantage in the ssl vpn market we currently compete with nortel in the layer 47 traffic management market and nokia resells our layer 47 products in the near term we do not anticipate that our entry into the ssl vpn market will affect nokia’s resale of our layer 47 products

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend   the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k    net revenues total net revenues increased 70 in fiscal year 2003 from fiscal year ended september 30 2002 or fiscal year 2002 compared to an increase of 08 in fiscal year 2002 from fiscal year 2001 international revenues represented 349 322 and 333 of net revenues in fiscal years 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively we expect international sales will continue to represent a significant portion of net revenues although we cannot provide assurance that international revenues as a percentage of net revenues will remain at current levels   net product revenues were 842 million for fiscal year 2003 compared to 826 million for fiscal year 2002 and 786 million for fiscal year 2001 the 20 increase in fiscal year 2003 was primarily the result of sales in asia pacific and europe the 50 increase in fiscal year 2002 was primarily the result of strong sales in north america partially offset by decreased sales in the asia pacific region   sales of our bigip products represented 828 841 and 789 of total product revenues in fiscal years 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively our bigip products consist of server appliances and ip application switches our ip application switch products including bigip 1000 bigip 2400 and the bigip 5100 were introduced in the first quarter of fiscal year 2003 and represented 418 of product revenues in fiscal year 2003 we expect to continue to derive a significant portion of our product revenues from sales of bigip in 17 the future and expect the percentage of bigip revenues derived from ip application switches to continue to increase as a percentage of total product revenues 

  net service revenues were 317 million for fiscal year 2003 compared to 257 million for fiscal year 2002 and 287 million for fiscal year 2001 service revenues increased by 233 in fiscal year 2003 primarily due to an increase in the renewal of service and support contracts by existing customers as our installed base increased the 106 decrease in service revenues in fiscal year 2002 compared to fiscal year 2001 was primarily due to changes in pricing and a larger percentage of our resellers providing maintenance and installation to endusers partially offset by an increase in the renewal of service and support contracts by existing customers   ingram micro inc one of our domestic distributors accounted for 126 of our total net revenues for fiscal year 2003 ingram micro accounted for 178 of our accounts receivable as of september 30 2003 no individual customer or distributor represented more than 10 of our total net revenues or accounts receivable for fiscal years 2002 and 2001    cost of net product revenues cost of net product revenues decreased to 178 million in fiscal year 2003 from 202 million in fiscal year 2002 and 332 million in fiscal year 2001 cost of net product revenues decreased as a percent of net product revenue to 212 in fiscal year 2003 from 245 in fiscal year 2002 and 423 in fiscal year 2001 the decrease in fiscal year 2003 was primarily the result of lower warranty manufacturing and component costs the decrease in fiscal year 2002 was primarily the result of lower excess inventory charges and manufacturing costs partially offset by increased warranty costs further in fiscal year 2002 we unified our supply chain with a single contract manufacturer and as result have improved our manufacturing efficiencies as well as realized lower component costs   cost of net service revenues cost of net service revenues decreased to 91 million in fiscal year 2003 from 102 million in fiscal year 2002 and 123 million in fiscal year 2001 cost of net service revenues decreased as a percent of net service revenues to 286 in fiscal year 2003 from 398 in fiscal year 2002 and 427 in fiscal year 2001 the decrease in fiscal year 2003 was primarily due to a decrease in personnel related costs associated with a decline in service personnel headcount and related costs during the last quarter of fiscal year 2002 this decrease in fiscal year 2002 was primarily due to improved operational efficiencies and a decrease in headcount and related costs 18    sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of the salaries commissions and related benefits of our sales and marketing staff the costs of our marketing programs including public relations advertising and trade shows and an allocation of our facilities and depreciation expenses sales and marketing expenses increased 57 to 535 million in fiscal year 2003 from 506 million in fiscal year 2002 the increase in fiscal year 2003 related primarily to increased payroll and related personnel costs and travel related expenses sales and marketing expenses decreased to 506 million in fiscal year 2002 from 508 million in fiscal year 2001 the decrease in fiscal year 2002 compared to fiscal year 2001 was due to a decrease in trade show and promotional activities and decreased business travel expenses partially offset by increased personnel costs as we continued to expand our international operations we expect to continue to increase sales and marketing expenses in order to grow net revenues and expand our brand awareness   research and development research and development expenses consist primarily of the salaries and related benefits for our product development personnel and an allocation of our facilities and depreciation expenses research and development expenses increased 70 to 192 million in fiscal year 2003 from 180 million in fiscal year 2002 and 174 million in fiscal year 2001 the increase in fiscal year 2003 was due to increased personnel related costs associated with an increase in headcount to 145 from 127 primarily as a result of the acquisition of substantially all the assets of uroam and an increase in prototype expenses the increase in fiscal year 2002 was due to increased personnel related costs and expenses related to the development of new products we expect to continue to increase research and development expenses as our future success is dependent on the continued enhancement of our current products and our ability to develop new products that meet the changing needs of our customers   general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of the salaries benefits and related costs of our executive finance information technology human resource and legal personnel thirdparty professional service fees bad debt charges and an allocation of our facilities and depreciation expenses general and administrative expenses decreased 201 to 120 million in fiscal year 2003 from 150 million in fiscal year 2002 and 188 million in fiscal year 2001 the decrease in fiscal year 2003 is primarily due to a decrease in professional services related to patent prosecution and other activities related to our intellectual property and lower bad debt charges the decrease in fiscal year 2002 is primarily due to lower bad debt charges and lower facilities expenses resulting from the sublease of one of our buildings partially offset by an increase in professional services related to patent prosecution and other activities related to our intellectual property 19   restructuring charges during the third quarter of fiscal year 2002 we recorded a restructuring charge of 28 million in connection with management’s decision to exit the cache appliance business as a result of changes in the business we wrote down certain assets consolidated operations and terminated 47 employees throughout all divisions of f5 networks in july 2002 all identified employees had been notified and terminated resulting in an additional charge of 05 million related to employee separation costs   during the first fiscal quarter of 2001 we recorded a restructuring charge totaling

networks by the end of january 2001 all identified employees had been terminated during the quarter ended march 31 2001 we reversed 96000 of previous estimates as of september 30 2001 substantially all of the restructuring charges accrued during the first quarter of 2001 had been paid see note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for a discussion of continuing restructuring liabilities   amortization of unearned compensation we have recorded a total of 83 million of stock compensation costs since our inception through september 30 2003 these charges represent the difference on the grant date between the exercise price and the deemed fair value of certain stock options granted to our employees and outside directors these options generally vest ratably over a fouryear period we are amortizing these costs using an accelerated method as prescribed by financial accounting standards board or fasb interpretation no 28 fin no 28 and recorded stock compensation charges of 01 million 04 million and 26 million for the fiscal years 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively unamortized stockbased compensation totaled 10000 at september 30 2003    other income net other income net consists primarily of investment income and foreign currency transaction gains and losses other income net decreased 471 to 08 million in fiscal year 2003 from 14 million in fiscal year 2002 and 20 million in fiscal year 2001 the decrease in fiscal year 2003 was primarily due to realized losses on sales of investments declining interest rates and interest income and an increase in foreign currency transaction losses the decrease in fiscal year 2002 was related to declining interest rates and investment income   provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes was 09 million 05 million and 41 million for fiscal years 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively the provision for income taxes represents foreign taxes related to our international operation with the exception of fiscal year 2001 which includes a charge of 34 million to provide a full valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets no federal or state income taxes were provided in fiscal years 2002 or 2003 20 liquidity and capital resources   we have funded our operations with our cash balances cash generated from operations and proceeds from public offerings    we consider all highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents totaled 104 million at the end of fiscal year 2003 compared to 208 million at the end of fiscal year 2002 and 183 million at the end of fiscal year 2001   cash provided by operating activities during fiscal year 2003 was 146 million compared to 95 million in fiscal year 2002 and cash used in operating activities was 118 million in fiscal year 2001 cash provided by operating activities in fiscal years 2003 and 2002 resulted primarily from cash generated from net income after adjusting for noncash charges changes in operating assets and liabilities and an increase in deferred revenue due to an increase in the renewal of service and support contracts by existing customers cash used in operating activities in fiscal year 2001 resulted primarily from operating losses partially offset by a decrease in net accounts receivable   cash used in investing activities was 381 million for the fiscal year 2003 127 million for fiscal year 2002 and 247 million for fiscal year 2001 the cash used in investing activities in fiscal year 2003 was primarily the result of the 274 million used to acquire substantially all the assets of uroam and purchase of investments and property and equipment partially offset by the sale of investments cash used in each of fiscal years 2002 and 2001 were due primarily to the purchase of investments and property and equipment partially offset by the sale of investments   cash provided by financing activities was 128 million for fiscal year 2003 compared to 55 million for fiscal year 2002 and 363 million for the fiscal year 2001 in fiscal years 2003 and 2002 our financing activities primarily related to cash received from the exercise of employee stock options and the purchase of common shares under our employee stock purchase plan in fiscal year 2001 we also received 349 million related to the issuance of common stock and warrants to nokia finance international bv the warrants expired in january 2003 without being exercised   we expect that our existing cash balances and cash from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated working capital and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future contractual obligations and commercial commitments   as of september 30 2003 our principal commitments consisted of obligations outstanding under operating leases in april 2000 we amended and restated the lease agreement relating to two buildings for our corporate headquarters the lease commenced in july 2000 on the first building and the lease on the second building commenced in september 2000 the lease for both buildings expires in 2012 with an option for renewal the lease for the second building has been fully subleased through 2012 we established a restricted escrow account in connection with this lease agreement under the term of the lease a 60 million certificate of deposit is required through november 2012 unless the lease is terminated before then this amount has 21 been included on our balance sheet as a component of restricted cash contractual obligations reflected in the following table are net of sublease income 

 

  critical accounting policies   our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions   we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements   revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with the guidance provided under statement of position sop no 972 “software revenue recognition” and sop no 989 “modification of sop no 972 software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions” statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 48 “revenue recognition when right of return exists” and securities and exchange commission or sec staff accounting bulleting sab no 101 “revenue recognition in financial statements”   we sell products through resellers oems and other channel partners as well as directly to end users under similar terms we recognize product revenue upon shipment net of estimated returns provided that collection is determined to be probable and no significant obligations remain product revenues from oem agreements are recognized based on reporting of sales from the oem partner whenever a software license hardware installation and postcontract customer support or pcs elements are combined into a package with a single “bundled” price a portion of the sales price is allocated to each element of the bundled elements based on their respective fair values as determined when the individual elements are sold separately revenues from the license of software are recognized when the software has been shipped and the customer is obligated to pay for the software when rights of return are present and we cannot estimate returns we recognize revenue when such rights of return lapse revenues for pcs are recognized on a straightline basis over the service contract term pcs includes rights to upgrades when and if available a limited period of telephone support updates and bug fixes installation revenue is recognized when the product has been installed at the customer’s site consulting services are customarily billed at fixed rates plus outofpocket expenses and revenues are recognized when the consulting has been completed training revenue is recognized when the training has been completed   our ordinary payment terms to our domestic customers are net 30 days our ordinary payment terms to our international customers are net 30 to 90 days based on normal and customary trade practices in the individual markets we have offered extended payment terms beyond ordinary terms to some customers for these arrangements revenue is recognized when payments become due   reserve for doubtful accounts estimates are used in determining our allowance for doubtful accounts and are based on a percentage of our accounts receivable by aging category in determining these percentages we evaluate historical writeoffs current trends in the credit quality of our customer base as well as changes in the credit policies we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition and generally do not require any collateral if there is a deterioration of a major customer’s credit worthiness or actual defaults are higher than our historical experience our allowance for doubtful accounts may not be insufficient 22   reserve for product returns product returns are estimated based on historical experience by type of product and are recorded at the time revenues are recognized in some instances product revenue from distributors is subject to agreements allowing rights of return accordingly we reduce recognized revenue for estimated future returns at the time revenue is recorded when rights of return are present and we cannot estimate returns revenue is recognized when such rights lapse the estimates for returns are adjusted periodically based upon changes in historical rates of returns inventory in the distribution channel and other related factors it is possible that these estimates will change in the future or that the actual amounts could vary from our estimates and result in reductions to recognized revenues   reserve for excess or obsolete inventory we currently reserve for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management additional inventory charges may be required   reserve for warranties a warranty reserve is established based on our historical experience and an estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date while we believe that our warranty reserve is adequate and that the judgment applied is appropriate such amounts estimated to be due and payable could differ materially from what will actually transpire in the future   income tax valuation allowance the company has net deferred tax assets at september 30 2003 totaling approximately 307 million which are fully offset by a valuation allowance due to management’s determination that the criteria for recognition have not been met in the event management were to determine that the company would be able to realize its net deferred tax assets in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be made increasing net income or decreasing net loss in the period in which such a determination was made   as of september 30 2003 approximately 127 million of the valuation allowance related to the company’s net operating loss carry forwards is derived from the tax benefits of stock option deductions at such time as the valuation allowance related to their deductions is released the benefits will be credited to additional paid in capital   purchase price allocation during 2003 the company acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of uroam inc for cash of 25 million the company also incurred 24 million of direct transaction costs for a total purchase price of 274 million the total purchase price was allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair value the excess of the purchase price over the fair value was recorded as goodwill the fair value assigned to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed were based upon estimates and assumptions developed by management and other information compiled by management recent accounting pronouncements   in may 2003 fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard no 150 “accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liability and equity” sfas no 150 sfas no 150 establishes standards for how companies classify and measure certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity sfas no 150 is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may 31 2003 the adoption of this standard did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements   in april 2003 fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 149 “amendment of statement 133 on derivative instruments and hedging activities” sfas no 149 which is generally effective for contracts entered into or modified after june 30 2003 and for hedging relationships designated after june 30 2003 sfas no 149 clarifies under what circumstances a contract with an initial net 23 investment meets the characteristic of a derivative as discussed in statement of financial accounting standards no 133 when a derivative contains a financing component amends the definition of an “underlying” to conform it to the language used in fasb interpretation no 45 “guarantor accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others” and amends certain other existing pronouncements the adoption of this standard did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 

  in january 2003 fasb issued interpretation no 46 fin no 46 “consolidation of variable interest entities” which addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities that either 1 do not have sufficient equity investment at risk to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support or 2 the company will hold a significant variable interest in or have significant involvement with an existing variable interest entity the adoption of this interpretation did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements   in november 2002 fasb issued interpretation no 45 fin no 45 “guarantor’s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others” which addresses the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under guarantees fin no 45 also requires the recognition of a liability by a guarantor at the inception of certain guarantees that are entered into or modified after december 31 2002 the additional disclosures required by fin no 45 have been included in the notes to our consolidated financial statements risk factors   in addition to the other information in this report the following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating our company and its business our success depends on sales and continued innovation of our bigip product line   for the fiscal year ended september 30 2003 we derived 828 of our product revenues from sales of our bigip product line we expect to derive a significant portion of our net revenues from sales of our bigip products in the future implementation of our strategy depends upon bigip being able to solve critical network availability and performance problems of our customers if bigip is unable to solve these problems for our customers or if we are unable to sustain the high levels of innovation in bigip’s product feature set needed to maintain leadership in what will continue to be a competitive market environment our business and results of operations will be harmed our success depends on our timely development of new products and features and proper management of the timing of the life cycle of our products   we expect the secure application traffic management market to be characterized by rapid technological change frequent new product introductions changes in customer requirements and evolving industry standards our continued success depends on our ability to identify and develop new products and new features for our existing products to meet the demands of these changes and for those products and features to be accepted by our existing and target customers if we are unable to identify develop and deploy new products and new product features on a timely basis or if those products do not gain market acceptance our business and results of operations may be harmed   the current life cycle of our products is typically 12 to 24 months the introduction of new products or product enhancements may shorten the life cycle of our existing products or replace sales of some of our current products thereby offsetting the benefit of even a successful product introduction and may cause customers to defer purchasing our existing products in anticipation of the new products this could harm our operating results by decreasing sales increasing our inventory levels of older products and exposing us to greater risk of product obsolescence we have also experienced and may in the future experience delays in developing and releasing new products and product enhancements this has led to and may in the future lead to delayed sales increased expenses and lower quarterly revenue than anticipated also in the development of our products we have experienced delays in the prototyping of our products which in turn has led to delays in 24 product introductions in addition complexity and difficulties in managing product transitions at the endoflife stage of a product can create excess inventory of components associated with the outgoing product that can lead to increased expenses any or all of the above problems could materially harm our business and operating results 

we may not be able to compete effectively in the emerging secure application traffic management market   the markets we serve are new rapidly evolving and highly competitive and we expect competition to persist and intensify in the future our principal competitors in the secure application traffic management market include cisco systems inc nortel networks corporation foundry networks inc netscaler inc radware ltd and netscreen technologies inc we expect to continue to face additional competition as new participants enter the traffic management market in addition larger companies with significant resources brand recognition and sales channels may form alliances with or acquire competing traffic management solutions and emerge as significant competitors potential competitors may bundle their products or incorporate an internet traffic management component into existing products in a manner that discourages users from purchasing our products potential customers may also choose to purchase additional or larger servers instead of our products our quarterly and annual operating results are volatile and may cause our stock price to fluctuate   our quarterly and annual operating results have varied significantly in the past and will vary significantly in the future which makes it difficult for us to predict our future operating results in particular we anticipate that the size of customer orders may increase as we continue to focus on larger business accounts a delay in the recognition of revenue even from just one account may have a significant negative impact on our results of operations for a given period in the past a majority of our sales have been realized near the end of a quarter accordingly a delay in an anticipated sale past the end of a particular quarter may negatively impact our results of operations for that quarter or in some cases that year furthermore we base our decisions regarding our operating expenses on anticipated revenue trends and our expense levels are relatively fixed consequently if revenue levels fall below our expectations our net income will decrease because only a small portion of our operating expenses vary with our revenues   we believe that periodtoperiod comparisons of our results of operations are not meaningful and should not be relied upon as indicators of future performance our operating results may be below the expectations of securities analysts and investors in future quarters or years our failure to meet these expectations will likely harm the market price of our common stock 

 

   we anticipate that the average selling prices of our products will decrease in the future in response to competitive pricing pressures increased sales discounts new product introductions by us or our competitors or other factors therefore in order to maintain our gross profits we must develop and introduce new products and product enhancements on a timely basis and continually reduce our product costs our failure to do so will cause our net revenue and gross profits to decline which will harm our business and results of operations in addition we may experience substantial periodtoperiod fluctuations in future operating results due to the erosion of our average selling prices 

 

   our products have a lengthy sales cycle which is difficult to predict historically our sales cycle has ranged from approximately two to three months and has tended to lengthen as we have increasingly focused our sales efforts on the enterprise market also as our distribution strategy has evolved into more of a channel model utilizing valueadded resellers distributors and systems integrators the level of variability in the length of sales cycle across transactions has increased and made it more difficult to predict the timing of many of our sales transactions sales of our bigip and 3dns products require us to educate potential customers in their use and benefits sales of our products are subject to delays from the lengthy internal budgeting approval and 25 competitive evaluation processes that large corporations and governmental entities may require for example customers frequently begin by evaluating our products on a limited basis and devote time and resources to testing our products before they decide whether or not to purchase customers may also defer orders as a result of anticipated releases of new products or enhancements by our competitors or us as a result our products have an unpredictable sales cycle that contributes to the uncertainty of our future operating results 

 

   we rely on a third party contract manufacturer to assemble our products we outsource the manufacturing of our hardware platforms to this contract manufacturer who assembles these hardware platforms to our specifications we have experienced minor delays in shipments from contract manufacturers in the past however if we experience major delays in the future or other problems such as inferior quality and insufficient quantity of product any one or a combination of these factors may harm our business and results of operations the inability of our contract manufacturer to provide us with adequate supplies of our products or the loss of our contract manufacturer may cause a delay in our ability to fulfill orders while we obtain a replacement manufacturer and may harm our business and results of operations in particular because we subcontract substantially all of our manufacturing to a single contract manufacturer with whom we do not have a longterm contract any termination loss or impairment in our arrangement with this single source of hardware assembly or any impairment of their facilities or operations would harm our business financial condition and results of operation   if the demand for our products grows we will need to increase our raw material and component purchases contract manufacturing capacity and internal test and quality functions any disruptions in product flow may limit our revenue may harm our competitive position and may result in additional costs or cancellation of orders by our customers 

 

   we currently purchase several hardware components used in the assembly of our products from a number of single or limited sources lead times for these components vary significantly any interruption or delay in the supply of any of these hardware components or the inability to procure a similar component from alternate sources at acceptable prices within a reasonable time may delay assembly and sales of our products and hence our revenues and may harm our business and results of operations 

 

   we rely on a combination of patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure of confidential and proprietary information to protect our intellectual property rights despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology monitoring unauthorized use of our products is difficult and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of our technology particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states   our industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights we are actively involved in disputes and licensing discussions with others regarding their claimed proprietary rights and cannot assure you that we will always successfully defend ourselves against such claims if we are found to infringe the proprietary rights of others or if we otherwise settle such claims we could be compelled to pay damages or royalties and either obtain a license to those intellectual property rights or alter our products so that they no longer infringe upon such proprietary rights any license could be very expensive to obtain or may not be available at all similarly changing our products or processes to avoid infringing the rights of others may be costly or impractical in addition we have initiated and may in the future initiate claims or litigation against third parties for 26 infringement of our proprietary rights including infringement of a patent we hold on our “cookie persistence” technology to determine the scope and validity of our proprietary rights or those of our competitors any of these claims whether claims that we are infringing the proprietary rights of others or vice versa with or without merit may be timeconsuming result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel or require us to cease using infringing technology develop noninfringing technology or enter into royalty or licensing agreements further our license agreements typically require us to indemnify our customers and resellers for infringement actions related to our technology which could cause us to become involved in infringement claims made against our customers or resellers any of the abovedescribed circumstances relating to intellectual property rights disputes could result in our business and results of operations being harmed 

 

   a change in accounting policies can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective new pronouncements and varying interpretations of pronouncements have occurred with frequency and may occur in the future changes to existing rules or the questioning of current practices may adversely affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business   in particular if we are required to record stock option grants as compensation expense on our income statement our profitability may be reduced significantly the current methodology for expensing such stock options is based on among other things the historical volatility of the underlying stock our stock price has been historically volatile therefore the adoption of an accounting standard requiring companies to expense stock options would negatively impact our profitability and may adversely impact our stock price in addition the adoption of such a standard could limit our ability to continue to use stock options as an incentive and retention tool which could in turn hurt our ability to recruit employees and retain existing employees   similarly while we believe our current revenue recognition policies and practices are consistent with applicable accounting standards current revenue recognition accounting standards and accounting guidance with respect to such standards are subject to change such changes could lead to unanticipated changes in our current revenue accounting practices and such changes could significantly reduce our future revenues and earnings which would likely have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock we may not be able to sustain or develop new distribution relationships and a reduction or delay in sales to a significant distribution partner could hurt our business   our sales strategy requires that we establish and maintain multiple distribution channels in the united states and internationally through leading industry resellers original equipment manufacturers or oems systems integrators internet service providers and other channel partners we have a limited number of agreements with companies in these channels and we may not be able to increase our number of distribution relationships or maintain our existing relationships if we are unable to establish and maintain our indirect sales channels our business and results of operations will be harmed in addition one distributor of our products accounted for 126 of our net revenue for the fiscal year ended september 30 2003 during the fiscal year ended september 30 2002 no single reseller or customer accounted for more than 10 of our net revenue a substantial reduction or delay in sales of our products to this or any other key distribution partner could harm our business operating results and financial condition undetected software errors may harm our business and results of operations   software products frequently contain undetected errors when first introduced or as new versions are released we have experienced these errors in the past in connection with new products and product upgrades we expect that these errors will be found from time to time in new or enhanced products after commencement of commercial shipments these problems may cause us to incur significant warranty and repair costs divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts and cause significant 27 customer relations problems we may also be subject to liability claims for damages related to product errors while we carry insurance policies covering this type of liability these policies may not provide sufficient protection should a claim be asserted a material product liability claim may harm our business and results of operations 

  our products must successfully operate with products from other vendors as a result when problems occur in a network it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem the occurrence of software errors whether caused by our products or another vendor’s products may result in the delay or loss of market acceptance of our products the occurrence of any of these problems may harm our business and results of operations our expansion into international markets may not succeed   we intend to continue expanding into international markets international sales represented 349 of our net revenues for the fiscal year ended september 30 2003 322 of our net revenues for the fiscal year ended september 30 2002 and 333 of our net revenues for the fiscal year ended september 30 2001 we have engaged sales personnel throughout europe and the asia pacific region our continued growth will require further expansion of our international operations in the european asia pacific and other markets if we are unable to expand our international operations successfully and in a timely manner our business and results of operations may be harmed such expansion may be more difficult or take longer than we anticipate and we may not be able to successfully market sell deliver and support our products internationally our operating results are exposed to risks associated with international commerce   as our international sales increase our operating results become more exposed to international operating risks these risks include risks related to potential recessions in economies outside the united states foreign currency exchange rates managing foreign sales offices regulatory political or economic conditions in specific countries military conflict or terrorist activities changes in laws and tariffs inadequate protection of intellectual property rights in foreign countries foreign regulatory requirements and natural disasters all of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business in particular in fiscal year 2003 we derived 138 of our total revenue from the japanese market and this revenue is dependent on a number of factors outside our control including the viability and success of our resellers and the strength of the japanese economy which has been weak in recent years acquisitions including our recent acquisition of substantially all of the assets of uroam inc present many risks and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that are contemplated at the time of the transaction   with respect to our july 2003 acquisition of substantially all of the assets of uroam inc as well as any other future acquisitions we may undertake we may find that the acquired assets do not further our business strategy as expected or that we paid more than what the assets are later worth or that economic conditions change all of which may generate future impairment charges there may be difficulty integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired business and we may have difficulty retaining the key personnel of the acquired business in the case of the assets acquired from uroam inc because it was based in northern california and because the employees we hired in connection with the acquisition were not relocated to seattle the abovementioned integration and personnel retention issues represent a particular risk to us we may have difficulty in incorporating the acquired technologies or products with our existing product lines our ongoing business and management’s attention may be disrupted or diverted by transition or integration issues and the complexity of managing geographically and culturally diverse locations we may have difficulty maintaining uniform standards controls procedures and policies across locations we may experience significant problems or liabilities associated with the product quality technology and other matters   our inability to successfully operate and integrate newlyacquired businesses appropriately effectively and in a timely manner or to retain key personnel of uroam inc or any other acquired business could have a material adverse effect on our ability to take advantage of further growth in demand for integrated traffic 28 management and security solutions and other advances in technology as well as on our revenues gross margins and expenses 

our success depends on our key personnel and our ability to attract train and retain qualified marketing and sales professional services and customer support personnel   our success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our key management product development sales marketing and finance personnel many of which may be difficult to replace the complexity of our secure application traffic management products and their integration into existing networks and ongoing support as well as the sophistication of our sales and marketing effort requires us to retain highly trained professional services customer support and sales personnel in spite of the economic downturn competition for qualified professional services customer support and sales personnel in our industry is intense because of the limited number of people available with the necessary technical skills and understanding of our products our ability to retain and hire these personnel may be adversely affected by volatility or reductions in the price of our common stock since these employees are generally granted stock options the loss of services of any of our key personnel the inability to retain and attract qualified personnel in the future or delays in hiring qualified personnel may harm our business and results of operations we face litigation risks   we are a party to lawsuits in the normal course of our business litigation in general and intellectual property and securities litigation in particular can be expensive lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations moreover the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict we believe that we have defenses in the lawsuits pending against us and we are vigorously contesting these allegations responding to the allegations has been and probably will be expensive and timeconsuming for us an unfavorable resolution of the lawsuits could adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition antitakeover provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us   our board of directors has the authority to issue up to 10000000 shares of preferred stock and to determine the price rights preferences privileges and restrictions including voting rights of those shares without any further vote or action by the stockholders the rights of the holders of common stock may be subject to and may be adversely affected by the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future the issuance of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a change of control of our company without further action by our stockholders and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of the holders of common stock further certain provisions of our bylaws including a provision limiting the ability of stockholders to raise matters at a meeting of stockholders without giving advance notice may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or management of our company which could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock in addition our articles of incorporation provide for a staggered board which may make it more difficult for a third party to gain control of our board of directors similarly state antitakeover laws in the state of washington related to corporate takeovers may prevent or delay a change of control of our company 


 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk   interest rate risk our cash equivalents consist of highquality securities as specified in our investment policy guidelines the policy limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue or issuer to a maximum of 20 of the total portfolio with the exception of treasury securities commercial paper and money market funds which are exempt from size limitation the policy requires investments in securities that mature in two years or less with the average maturity being one year or less these securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if interest rates increase a decrease of one percent in the average interest would have resulted in a decrease of approximately 07 million in our interest income 29    foreign currency risk the majority of our sales and expenses are denominated in us dollars and as a result we have not experienced significant foreign currency transaction gains and losses to date while we have conducted some transactions in foreign currencies during the fiscal year ended september 30 2003 and expect to continue to do so we do not anticipate that foreign currency transaction gains or losses will be significant at our current level of operations however as we continue to expand our operations internationally they may become significant in the future we have not engaged in foreign currency hedging to date however we may do so in the future 30

item 1 business general   we develop manufacture and sell products and services to help companies efficiently and securely manage their internet traffic as well as the access and use of their intranetbased software applications our application traffic management products including the bigip controller 3dns controller and bigip link controller help manage internet traffic to servers and network devices in a way that maximizes the availability scalability and throughput of those network components and the applications that run on them our recently acquired firepass family of network server appliances provides secure user access to corporate networks and individual applications through any standard web browser our unique icontrol architecture enables our products to communicate with one another in the network and ensure optimal throughput of traffic and also allows them to be integrated with third party products including enterprise applications this facilitates the automation of repetitive processes and allows the customer to optimize applications on their networks thereby saving them time and money as components of an integrated solution our products address many elements required for successful internet and intranet business applications including high availability high performance intelligent load balancing streamlined manageability remote access to corporate networks and network and application security our solution for application traffic management and security is softwarebased which differentiates us from our competitors whose solutions are largely hardwarebased we believe this differentiation enables us to offer our customers greater flexibility costeffectiveness and adaptability in response to today’s rapidly changing environment   enterprise customers fortune 1000 or business week global 1000 companies in financial services manufacturing transportation and mobile telecommunications make up the largest percentage of our customer base we market and sell our products primarily through indirect sales channels in north america europe and the asia pacific region and to some direct customer accounts in north america we have subsidiaries or branch offices in australia canada china france germany hong kong japan the netherlands singapore south korea spain taiwan thailand and the united kingdom   in july 2003 we acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of uroam inc or uroam for 250 million in cash we also incurred 24 million of direct transaction costs for a net purchase price of 274 million we hired substantially all of uroam’s 20 employees consisting of product development sales and service personnel uroam’s family of firepass servers is a comprehensive remote access product set that enables users to access applications in a secure fashion using technology based on the secure sockets layer or ssl standard we believe firepass provides a security solution that is easier to manage and use and is more secure than existing virtual private network or vpn solutions allowing customers to realize significant cost savings for secure remote access to any application the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of uroam will allow us to quickly enter the ssl vpn market broaden our customer base and augment our existing product line 3   we were incorporated on february 26 1996 in the state of washington our headquarters is in seattle washington and our mailing address is 401 elliott avenue west seattle washington 98119 the telephone number at our executive

as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with the securities and exchange commission industry background   as a result of the internet’s capabilities it has become a fundamental tool for commerce and communications since the late 1990’s businesses have responded to the power flexibility and economy of the internet by deploying new internet protocol or ip based applications upgrading their clientserver applications to new ipenabled versions and enabling existing applications for use over the internet ip is a communications language that is used for transmitting data over the internet during the next several years we believe this process of deploying ipenabled applications will accelerate as web services enable businesses to build applications quickly and easily by integrating software modules available from many different sources web services allow businesses to combine functions of existing applications and processes to create new applications and functionality operating over the internet and beyond the corporate firewall the purpose of web services is to enable applications to interact with each other more smoothly reducing inefficiencies associated with human intervention a fullyintegrated web servicesenabled computing network would allow personal computers servers handheld devices programs applications and network equipment to work together directly to generate more efficient data flow and application development and use in addition we believe that the growth of internet usage will continue to be driven by new applications such as voice over ip or voip increased penetration of broadband internet access enabling the remote use of more applications and the increasing popularity of mobile internet access through wireless devices such as cellular telephones personal digital assistants and notebook computers   current traffic management products are designed primarily to manage web traffic however few products are equipped with the functionality and flexibility to securely manage the full range of ipenabled applications such as oracle financials bea weblogic and siebel sales force automation   internet architecture   the open systems interconnect reference model or osi model is the framework that describes and defines how networked systems communicate with one another the osi model divides network functions into seven layers and specifies how the layers should interact to enable interoperability between the various users these interoperability standards have been designed to allow all parts of the network to work together regardless of the different hardware and software components ip requires all data transmitted across the internet to be divided into packets prior to its transmission and reassembled at its destination prior to transmission each packet of data is automatically given a header that identifies the source and destination of the packet this header information is used in the osi model for the purposes of identifying routing and sequencing data packets and is stripped from the data upon arrival at its destination   layer 47 traffic management   layers 2 and 3 of the osi model primarily perform standardized repetitive tasks such as ensuring that packets of information sent over the internet arrive at the destination to which they are addressed and reassembling them in the correct sequence unlike layers 2 and 3 layers 47 are complex and variable and must support enduser applications and processes on a wide variety of platforms and devices for example layer 7 which encompasses the functions of layers 5 and 6 enables email directory lookup and the transfer of files between otherwise incompatible systems   while traditional layer 23 switching devices are used primarily to ensure correct delivery of packets of information there is an increasing need for layer 7 technology that can read the entire contents of a packetized transmission and make intelligent decisions based on a dynamic set of business rules about how to 4 handle the transmission and where to route it to ensure the availability and optimal performance of applications servers and the network additionally layer 23 as well as layer 4 switching devices are primarily hardwarebased and are optimized for speed at the expense of flexibility while most manufacturers of layer 7 switching devices have also opted for the traditional costly hardwarebased solutions this limits the ability of their products to adapt to the rapidly changing requirements of layer 7 traffic management needed for common enduser applications today 

  according to the “ethernet switch report — 5year forecast” prepared by dell’oro group the traditional layer 47 traffic management market is expected to grow from 432 million in 2002 to 870 million in 2007 representing a fiveyear compounded annual growth rate of approximately 15 additional emerging growth markets for layer 47 traffic management include blade servers mobile ip and web services a blade server is a thin modular electronic circuit board intended for a single dedicated application such as serving web pages or server load balancing that can be easily inserted into a spacesaving chassis with many similar blade servers blade servers loaded into chassis are designed to consume less energy and require considerably less space than conventional servers   growth in demand for secure traffic management   as internet traffic and the use of ipenabled applications have increased the demands placed on layer 7 have also increased and so has the demand for integrated effective layer 7 traffic management solutions corporations are becoming more reliant on highly sophisticated ipenabled applications both for their internal operations and for interactions with external customers and partners the need to guarantee the security of electronic information and transactions has led to the emergence of ssl encryption as the standard for secure ipenabled traffic during the interaction between a user and a financial application for example data sent from the user to the server is typically encrypted by the user’s web browser and decrypted by the server and this process is reversed for data sent back to the user the use of ssl has continued to grow with the proliferation of webbased applications that require secure transactions increases in the number and sophistication of web attacks and the damage caused by such attacks are also driving demand for more effective security solutions   ssl is also the core of new technology that addresses the growing need for corporations to provide secure connectivity for the rapidly increasing number of users who access corporate networks and applications from remote locations using a variety of devices ranging from home personal computers and laptops to cellular telephones and personal digital assistants many companies currently provide remote access to offsite users through vpns based on the internet protocol security or ipsec framework which allows remote users to access corporate networks and applications by means of encrypted “tunnels” through the internet vpns are costeffective because they use the internet for lowcost transmission of information while providing remote users with a highly secure connection however a key security risk associated with ipsec vpns is that once remote users are connected they have unrestricted access to all applications and resources within the network   during the past year new vpn technology using the ssl protocol has steadily gained acceptance as a more costeffective solution that is both simpler to deploy and easier to manage than ipsec vpns unlike ipsec vpns ssl vpns do not require customers to purchase and install clientside software on every remote device that accesses the network instead they use the ssl capabilities resident in a remote client’s internet browser to establish and maintain a secure connection between the client and the vpn server this eliminates both the initial cost of distributing and implementing clientside software and the recurring costs of upgrading and maintaining it in addition to providing secure network access ssl technology can also be used to selectively limit access to certain applications and resources within the network depending on the identity of the user because of the improved security and reduced overall costs we believe sslbased solutions will become the dominant method for remote access within the next few years   according to infonetics research’s “vpn and firewall products quarterly worldwide market share and forecasts for 2q03” report the ssl vpn market is expected to grow from 34 million in 2002 to 607 million by 2006 representing a fouryear compounded annual growth rate of approximately 105 5 the f5 solution   we believe our products are superior to those of our competitors in addressing the growing need among enterprises for integrated secure application traffic management   software based products from our inception we have been committed to the belief that the complexity of layer 7 traffic management requires a softwarebased rather than a hardwarebased solution we believe our softwarebased solution for application traffic management and security using commodity hardware provides greatly increased functionality we also believe our products are more costeffective flexible and easily adaptable to today’s constantly changing and increasingly demanding environments than our competitors’ solutions which are primarily hardwarebased in addition our software can be easily ported to commodity hardware platforms manufactured by thirdparty vendors which has enabled us to license the software to our original equipment manufacturer or oem partners who resell it installed on their own products it has also created an opportunity for us to sell versions of our software that run on blade servers manufactured by thirdparty vendors thereby increasing the target market for our software   application awareness one of the most important features of our softwarebased products is their “application awareness” our products are designed using a common architecture called icontrol with a common interface that allows them to communicate with one another and with thirdparty software and devices through our unique open icontrol application programming interface or api thirdparty applications and network devices can take an active role in shaping ip network traffic directing traffic based on exact business requirements specified by our customers for example our icontrol api allows an organization running oracle software which has help desks located in bombay san francisco and london to cause that software to make a realtime request that all email requests for help be directed to a single one of our 3dns devices that has been instructed to redirect the requests to different help desks at different times of the day similarly our bigip device managing traffic to an ecommerce web site could for example be directed to recognize transmissions from preferred customers and route them to a server that will expedite their transactions this “application awareness” capability is one of the most important features of our softwarebased products and serves as a further point of differentiation for our solution in comparison with those offered by our competitors   another key benefit of our softwarebased solution is that it allows the customer to incorporate specific business rules and processes into the software this capability which we call irules is a simple tool that can be used to define how the user wants to direct persist on or filter traffic based on the needs of each application   furthermore our universal inspection engine the core of our application traffic management technology is unique in its ability to inspect ip traffic down to the packet payload level and can direct traffic according to flexible irules specified by the user this “deep packet inspection” technology enables powerful offloading inspection and processing of applicationlevel transactions   integrated traffic management and security solution our application traffic management technology is differentiated from other solutions primarily by its ability to intercept inspect and act on the contents of traffic from virtually every type of ipenabled application this deep packet inspection technology allows us to offer an integrated traffic management and security solution that can detect and prevent many network level attacks   our firepass technology enables us to offer secure remote access through ssl vpns firepass has components that allow remote users to access any application or resource connected to the network including legacy hosts desktops and clientserver applications over the course of the next twelve months we intend to combine our ssl vpn technology with our secure traffic management capabilities providing significant differentiation from our competitors this capability will enable our products to provide comprehensive application security at multigigabit speeds   combined with the sophisticated inspection and control capabilities of our application traffic management technology we believe that firepass technology is an ideal platform for the development of advanced application security gateways that can control access to individual applications and the data and resources they 6 use because our bigip software can examine the entire contents of a transmission it can detect irregularities that might represent a security violation but which may pass undetected through an organization’s firewall and other network security devices as a result we believe that firepass is an ideal platform for the development of technology to protect the integrity of ipbased applications and the data and resources they use in the future we plan to use bigip and firepass to develop a comprehensive security solution that protects network applications from unauthorized access which existing safeguards may fail to prevent 

strategy   our objective is to be the leading provider of secure application traffic management solutions designed to enhance and optimize server availability security and performance key components of our strategy include   offering a complete application security solution and product set we plan to utilize our core technologies from our bigip and firepass products to deliver standalone and integrated systems that protect applications from hostile and inadvertent threats including usertosystem application security and systemtosystem application security problems we believe these solutions will differentiate our products in the security market and provide a unique solution to the problem of vulnerability of missioncritical applications   increasing the addressable market for our products in order to enable significant growth over the next three years we intend to target logical extensions of our traditional traffic management market including the areas of blade server software mobile ip infrastructure which is a mechanism for maintaining transparent network connectivity to mobile hosts web services infrastructure and utility computing and data center virtualization infrastructure in which corporations pay only for the computing resources they use this allows their information technology resources to be allocated on an asneeded basis to meet rapidly changing business demands in addition we plan to enter adjacent markets such as the application security market with our first product offering being an ssl vpn solution   investing in technology to continue to meet customer needs we plan to continue to invest in research and development to provide our customers with complete secure application traffic management and secure remote access solutions our softwarebased platforms are designed to quickly and easily expand the features and functionalities of our products as well as enabling us to develop additional products that address the complex and changing needs of our customers we will continue to use commodity hardware in order to ensure performance and cost competitiveness we also plan to deliver specialized software modules that will allow our customers to purchase software for our platforms as upgrades with specific features based on specific requirements   enhancing the existing channel model we are investing significant resources in order to further develop our indirect sales channels we plan to expand our indirect sales channels through leading industry resellers oems systems integrators internet service providers and other channel partners also we are leveraging our existing channels by delivering application security products including firepass ssl vpns making these channels more productive   continuing to build and expand relationships with strategic icontrol partners we plan to capitalize on our strategic relationships with enterprise software vendors who have created interfaces to our products through our icontrol api these vendors provide us significant leverage in the selling process because they recommend our products to their customers in order to differentiate ourselves further from our competitors we plan to explore opportunities to further embed icontrol into existing and new third party products and to jointly market and sell our solutions to enterprise customers with these key partners   enhancing our brand we plan to continue building brand awareness that positions us as one of the leading providers of secure application traffic management solutions our goal is for the f5 brand to be synonymous with superior performance highquality customer service and ease of use products   our core technology is software for ip application traffic management and secure remote access to ip networks and applications we also manufacture several types of systems which are software and hardware 7 bundled together as an integrated product offering bigip server appliances bigip application switches 3dns controller bigip link controller and firepass ssl vpn servers each incorporating our software with commodity components to provide a complete solution 

  bigip software and systems   our flagship product is the bigip controller for localarea application traffic management bigip software runs on a variety of commodity hardware platforms including ip application switches and server appliances manufactured by us and our oem partners as well as on blade servers manufactured by server vendors such as dell inc fujitsu siemens computers gmbh hewlett packard company international business machines corporation and nec corporation the core of bigip is sophisticated software that manages ip traffic at layer 7 also known as the application layer our bigip application switches also perform layer 23 switching and we believe industryleading layer 4 switching but we believe it is the superior performance and functionality of the bigip layer 7 traffic management software that distinguishes it from competing products sold by cisco systems nortel networks and others in addition bigip has a patented feature known as “cookie persistence” which establishes a link between a user and a specific server and enables the user to return to that server if the connection is broken before a transaction is completed   bigip server appliances were our original products and accounted for 169 of our product revenue for fiscal year 2003 the bigip 520 and 540 server appliances are equipped with intel processors for highspeed layer 47 processing and are designed to accommodate easilyinstalled upgrade cards that provide fast integrated ssl encryption and decryption integrated ssl processing has been an important factor of system sales by offloading ssl processing which requires significant server and computing power from servers to our traffic management systems customers can free up valuable server space for other applications   in september 2001 we introduced our first ip application switch the bigip 5000 in response to customer demand for systems with an increased number of ports allowing them to be connected to many different types of network devices integrated layer 23 switching and ssl processing capability we currently offer the highend bigip 5100 the bigip 2400 midrange product with integrated layer 4 switching on an applicationspecific integrated circuit or asic developed by our hardware team and the bigip 1000 entrylevel switch   3dns and link controller   our other traffic management products include 3dns controller and bigip link controller 3dns allows enterprises with geographically dispersed data centers to direct traffic to a particular data center in accordance with customized business rules or to redirect traffic to an available data center if one of their sites becomes overloaded or is shut down for any reason link controller allows enterprises with more than one internet service provider to manage the use of their available bandwidth to minimize costs while ensuring the highest quality of service 3dns and link controller are sold separately on individual ip application switches and server appliances or bundled with bigip on a single appliance or ip application switch   firepass   firepass systems provide ssl vpn access for remote users of ip networks and any applications connected to those networks from any standard web browser on any device the components of firepass include a dynamic policy engine which manages user authentication and authorization privileges and special components that enable corporations to give remote users controlled access to the full array of applications and resources within the network   our firepass line of ssl vpn servers currently includes the firepass 1000 and the firepass 4000 which support 100 and 1000 concurrent users respectively both support the complete range of firepass software features and offer a comprehensive solution for webbased remote access to corporate applications and desktops 8   enabling technologies   our products also come equipped with our icontrol and icontrol services manager or ism functions which are designed to facilitate the broader use of our products in early 2001 we recognized a growing need for traffic management products that could not only communicate with one another but also with the increasing number and variety of ipenabled enterprise applications being deployed by large organizations at that time we published the icontrol interface in a free software development kit or sdk that allows customers and independent software vendors to modify their programs to communicate with our products the use of icontrol reduces or eliminates the need for human involvement significantly reducing the cost of performing basic network functions and dramatically reducing the likelihood of error adding this extra functionality to their products is attractive to independent software vendors and since the introduction of our icontrol sdk we have formed relationships with dozens of software developers including microsoft corporation oracle corporation bea systems inc international business machines corporation hewlett packard company siebel systems inc and mercury interactive corporation although we do not derive revenue from icontrol itself the sale of icontrolenabled independent software vendor products helps promote and often leads directly to the sale of our other products   icontrol services manager takes advantage of icontrol to provide a single centralized management and operational interface for our devices this feature allows customers with dozens or hundreds of our products to upgrade or modify the software on those products simultaneously from a single console this lowers the cost and simplifies the task of deploying managing and maintaining our products and reduces the likelihood of error when blanket changes are implemented product development   our future success depends on our ability to maintain technology leadership in secure application traffic management by constantly improving our products and by developing new products to meet the changing needs of our customers our product development group which is divided along product lines employs a standard process for the development documentation and quality control of software and systems that is designed to meet these goals we are currently focused on developing enhancements to our existing traffic management and ssl vpn products in order to deliver greater functionality and performance we are also developing an integrated application security gateway which will combine our security and traffic management technologies in order to deliver a network device that protects applications from hostile attacks by ensuring usertosystem application security and systemtosystem application security the application security gateway will provide comprehensive application security   in order to advance our product development we also engage in technology partnerships with software and component manufacturers that allow us to integrate industrystandard technology with our own products during the past two years we have had a close working relationship with broadcom corporation which manufactures the layer 23 switch chips and ssl processors used in our family of application switches   our principal software engineering group which develops our application traffic management technology is located in our headquarters in seattle washington our firepass product development team which includes the original developers of the technology is located in san jose california our hardware engineering group is located in spokane washington members of these teams collaborate closely with one another on specific projects   during the fiscal years ended september 30 2003 2002 and 2001 we had research and product development expenses of 192 million 180 million and 174 million respectively customers   we have a globally diversified base of customers consisting primarily of large enterprises although we do not target specific vertical markets enterprise customers in financial services manufacturing transportation and mobile telecommunications currently make up the largest percentage of our customer base the other significant components of our customer base are internet service providers internet hosting companies and 9 internet commerce companies in fiscal year 2003 international sales represented 349 of our net revenues see note 14 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding our revenues by geographic area 

  prior to fiscal year 2001 our enduser customer base was comprised primarily of internet service providers internet hosting companies and internet startups engaged in ecommerce starting in the first half of fiscal year 2001 as demand from those customers weakened we successfully refocused our marketing and sales efforts on large enterprises which currently account for the majority of our revenue without any material adverse effect on our revenues consistent with our goal of building a strong channel sales model the majority of our revenue is generated by sales though our distributors valueadded resellers and systems integrators   for fiscal year 2003 sales to ingram micro inc one of our distributors represented 126 of our revenues our agreement with ingram micro is a standard nonexclusive distribution agreement that renews automatically on an annual basis and is terminable by either party with 30 days’ prior written notice the agreement grants ingram micro the right to distribute our products to resellers in north america and certain other territories internationally with no minimum purchase requirements sales and marketing   sales   we sell our software systems and services to large enterprise customers through a variety of channels including oems distributors valueadded resellers and systems integrators a substantial amount of our revenue for fiscal year 2003 was derived from these channel sales we also sell our products and services to major accounts through our own direct sales force in most cases service contracts are negotiated directly with the customer typically our agreements with our channel partners are not exclusive and do not prevent them from selling competitive products these agreements typically have terms of one year with no obligation to renew and typically do not provide for exclusive sales territories or minimum purchase requirements   direct sales our field sales personnel are located in major cities throughout north america europe and the asia pacific region the inside sales team generates and qualifies leads for regional sales managers and helps manage accounts by serving as a liaison between the field and internal corporate resources we sell our products directly to a limited group of customers primarily oems including dell inc fujitsu siemens computers gmbh hewlett packard company international business machines corporation and nec corporation and certain large enterprise endusers whose accounts are managed by our major account services team field systems engineers also support our regional sales managers by participating in joint sales calls and providing presale technical resources as needed the majority of our field sales personnel work closely with our channel partners to assist them in selling our products to their customers as the bulk of our sales are made through distributors or valueadded resellers   distributor and valueadded reseller relationships we have established relationships with large national and international distributors local and specialized distributors and valueadded resellers the distributors sell our products and the valueadded resellers not only sell our products but also assist their customers in network design installation and testing our primary distributor relationships include ingram micro inc in north america and in certain territories internationally and our primary valueadded reseller relationships include milestone systems inc   systems integrators we also market our products through strategic relationships we have with systems integrators which design and install networks that incorporate our systems systems integrators typically do not purchase and resell equipment to their customers instead they typically recommend equipment to their customers for use in the systems they design and install we currently have relationships with a number of systems integrators including electronic data systems corporation   marketing   the cornerstone of our marketing strategy is the establishment of strong partnerships with large prominent companies that are leaders in their respective industries by partnering with these firms we have 10 been able to gain visibility with prospective customers and access to large accounts that we would not have been able to achieve on our own currently we have three principal types of marketing partnerships that overlap to varying degrees with our sales channel partnerships these include 

  icontrol partnerships we have established relationships with various independent software vendors who have adapted their applications to interact with our products via the icontrol interface icontrol enhances the functionality of third party applications by enabling them to control the network in an automated way based on business policies and rules associated with the application as a result customers who purchase icontrolenabled applications have an incentive to purchase our products in order to take advantage of the enhanced functionality made possible through our technical cooperation   blade server relationships we have relationships with various system vendors dell inc fujitsu siemens computers gmbh hewlett packard company international business machines corporation and nec corporation to market our bigip blade controller software for use on their blade server systems market focus and strategy are different for each relationship in some of these relationships vendors or their channel partners resell blade controller software to their customers   oem partnership with dell inc we license our software to dell which resells it on its own line of traffic management products in conjunction with this arrangement we participate in joint marketing programs with dell   we engage in a number of marketing programs and initiatives aimed at promoting our brand and creating market awareness of our technology and products these include actively participating in industry trade shows and briefing industry analysts and members of the trade press on our latest products and on new business and technology partnerships in addition we market our products to chief information officers and other information technology professionals through targeted advertising direct mail and highprofile web events backlog   our backlog represents orders confirmed with a purchase order for products to be shipped generally within 90 days to customers with approved credit status orders are subject to cancellation rescheduling by customers or product specification changes by the customers although we believe that the backlog orders are firm purchase orders may be cancelled by the customer prior to shipment without significant penalty for this reason we believe that our backlog at any given date is not a reliable indicator of future revenues customer service and technical support   our ability to provide consistent highquality customer service and technical support is a key factor in attracting and retaining customers prior to the installation of our products our services personnel work with customers to analyze their network needs and determine the best way to deploy our products and configure product features and functions to meet those needs our services personnel also provide onsite installation and training services to help customers make optimal use of product features and functions installation generally occurs within 30 days of product shipment to the customer   at the time of purchase customers typically purchase a oneyear maintenance contract renewable annually which entitles them to an array of services provided by our technical support team maintenance services provided under the contract include online updates software error correction releases ask f5 described below and remote support through a 24 hours a day 7 days a week help desk although not all service contracts entitle a customer to roundtheclock call center support updates to our software are only available to customers with a current maintenance contract our technical support team also offers seminars and training classes for customers on the configuration and use of products including local and wide area network system administration and management in addition we have a professional services team able to provide a full range of feebased consulting services including comprehensive network management documentation and performance analysis and capacity planning to assist in predicting future network requirements 11   we also offer as part of our maintenance service an online automated selfhelp customer support function called ask f5 that allows customers to answer many commonly asked questions without having to call our support desk this allows the customer to rapidly address issues and questions while significantly reducing the number of calls to our support desk this enables us to provide comprehensive customer support while keeping our support related expenses at a manageable consistent level manufacturing   we outsource the manufacturing of our preconfigured hardware platforms to a contract manufacturer solectron corporation which assembles each product to our specifications hardware platforms for our traffic management products consist primarily of a commodity computing platform custom and commodity asics a rackmount enclosure system and a customdesigned front panel solectron also installs our application traffic management software onto these hardware platforms and conducts functionality testing quality assurance and documentation control prior to shipping our products   our agreement with solectron allows them to procure component inventory on our behalf based upon a rolling production forecast subcontractors supply solectron with standard parts and components for our products based on our production forecast we are contractually obligated to purchase component inventory that our contract manufacturer procures in accordance with the forecast unless we give notice of order cancellation in advance of applicable lead times for any completed product inventory carried by solectron beyond 30 days solectron will charge us a monthly carrying fee of 15 alternatively we have the option to purchase inventory held by solectron beyond 30 days to avoid incurring related carrying charges as protection against component shortages and to provide replacement parts for our service teams we also stock limited supplies of certain key components for our products   in addition we obtain all of the layer 23 switch chips and the ssl processors used in our family of application switches from broadcom corporation we purchase components from broadcom on a purchase order basis with pricing updated at agreed upon intervals certain products purchased from broadcom were designed with our input but are not exclusive to us we also designed a layer 4 asic which is used in one of our products and is manufactured for us by a contract semiconductor foundry competition   our principal competitors in the traffic management market are cisco systems inc and nortel networks corporation other competitors in this market include foundry networks inc netscaler inc and radware ltd   cisco systems has a product set similar to ours and holds the largest share of the market cisco has a longer operating history and significantly greater financial technical marketing and other resources than we do cisco also has a more extensive customer base and broader customer relationships including relationships with many of our current and potential customers in addition cisco has large wellestablished worldwide customer support and professional services organizations and a more extensive direct sales force and sales channels   like cisco nortel has a product set similar to ours and has a longer operating history greater resources a larger customer base and a larger sales and service organization whereas cisco has historically focused on large corporate enterprise customers nortel has primarily focused on telecommunications and internet service provider customers   because of our relatively smaller size market presence and resources cisco nortel and other larger competitors may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements there is also the possibility that these companies may adopt aggressive pricing policies to gain market share as a result our competitors pose a serious competitive threat that could undermine our ability to win new customers and maintain our existing customer base   our most prominent competitors in the ssl vpn market are aventail corporation neoteris inc and safeweb inc netscreen technologies inc recently announced its acquisition of neoteris and symantec 12 corp recently announced its acquisition of safeweb with both moves designed to allow the buyer to enter the ssl vpn market nokia corporation and nortel networks corporation have also recently introduced ssl vpn products while we believe our firepass products are superior to their offerings some of our competitors have resources and distribution channels that are much larger than ours and could give them a significant competitive advantage in the ssl vpn market we currently compete with nortel in the layer 47 traffic management market and nokia resells our layer 47 products in the near term we do not anticipate that our entry into the ssl vpn market will affect nokia’s resale of our layer 47 products 

  ssl vpns are a potential replacement for ipsec vpns the most widely deployed solution for secure remote access today the current leaders in the ipsec vpn market are check point software technologies ltd and netscreen both of which are larger and betterknown vendors than us intellectual property   we rely on a combination of patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights we have obtained three patents in the united states and have applications pending for various aspects of our technology our future success depends in part on our ability to protect our proprietary rights to the technologies used in our principal products despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use trade secrets or other information that we regard as proprietary in addition the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights as fully as do the laws of the united states we cannot assure you that any issued patent will preserve our proprietary position or that competitors or others will not develop technologies similar to or superior to our technology our failure to enforce and protect our intellectual property rights could harm our business operating results and financial condition   in addition to our own proprietary software we incorporate software licensed from several thirdparty sources into our products these licenses generally renew automatically on an annual basis we believe that alternative technologies for this licensed software are available both domestically and internationally   f5 f5 networks bigip 3dns icontrol irules and firepass are our trademarks or registered trademarks oracle financials bea weblogic and siebel salesforce automation are trademarks of oracle corporation bea systems inc and siebel systems inc respectively employees   as of september 30 2003 we employed 507 fulltime persons including 145 in product development 211 in sales and marketing 84 in professional services and technical support and 67 in finance administration and operations none of our employees is represented by a labor union we have experienced no work stoppages and believe that our employee relations are good

  net service revenues were 317 million for fiscal year 2003 compared to 257 million for fiscal year 2002 and 287 million for fiscal year 2001 service revenues increased by 233 in fiscal year 2003 primarily due to an increase in the renewal of service and support contracts by existing customers as our installed base increased the 106 decrease in service revenues in fiscal year 2002 compared to fiscal year 2001 was primarily due to changes in pricing and a larger percentage of our resellers providing maintenance and installation to endusers partially offset by an increase in the renewal of service and support contracts by existing customers   ingram micro inc one of our domestic distributors accounted for 126 of our total net revenues for fiscal year 2003 ingram micro accounted for 178 of our accounts receivable as of september 30 2003 no individual customer or distributor represented more than 10 of our total net revenues or accounts receivable for fiscal years 2002 and 2001

revenues decreased as a percent of net product revenue to 212 in fiscal year 2003 from 245 in fiscal year 2002 and 423 in fiscal year 2001 the decrease in fiscal year 2003 was primarily the result of lower warranty manufacturing and component costs the decrease in fiscal year 2002 was primarily the result of lower excess inventory charges and manufacturing costs partially offset by increased warranty costs further in fiscal year 2002 we unified our supply chain with a single contract manufacturer and as result have improved our manufacturing efficiencies as well as realized lower component costs   cost of net service revenues cost of net service revenues decreased to 91 million in fiscal year 2003 from 102 million in fiscal year 2002 and 123 million in fiscal year 2001 cost of net service revenues decreased as a percent of net service revenues to 286 in fiscal year 2003 from 398 in fiscal year 2002 and 427 in fiscal year 2001 the decrease in fiscal year 2003 was primarily due to a decrease in personnel related costs associated with a decline in service personnel headcount and related costs during the last quarter of fiscal year 2002 this decrease in fiscal year 2002 was primarily due to improved operational efficiencies and a decrease in headcount and related costs 18    sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of the salaries commissions and related benefits of our sales and marketing staff the costs of our marketing programs including public relations advertising and trade shows and an allocation of our facilities and depreciation expenses sales and marketing expenses increased 57 to 535 million in fiscal year 2003 from 506 million in fiscal year 2002 the increase in fiscal year 2003 related primarily to increased payroll and related personnel costs and travel related expenses sales and marketing expenses decreased to 506 million in fiscal year 2002 from 508 million in fiscal year 2001 the decrease in fiscal year 2002 compared to fiscal year 2001 was due to a decrease in trade show and promotional activities and decreased business travel expenses partially offset by increased personnel costs as we continued to expand our international operations we expect to continue to increase sales and marketing expenses in order to grow net revenues and expand our brand awareness   research and development research and development expenses consist primarily of the salaries and related benefits for our product development personnel and an allocation of our facilities and depreciation expenses research and development expenses increased 70 to 192 million in fiscal year 2003 from 180 million in fiscal year 2002 and 174 million in fiscal year 2001 the increase in fiscal year 2003 was due to increased personnel related costs associated with an increase in headcount to 145 from 127 primarily as a result of the acquisition of substantially all the assets of uroam and an increase in prototype expenses the increase in fiscal year 2002 was due to increased personnel related costs and expenses related to the development of new products we expect to continue to increase research and development expenses as our future success is dependent on the continued enhancement of our current products and our ability to develop new products that meet the changing needs of our customers   general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of the salaries benefits and related costs of our executive finance information technology human resource and legal personnel

from 150 million in fiscal year 2002 and 188 million in fiscal year 2001 the decrease in fiscal year 2003 is primarily due to a decrease in professional services related to patent prosecution and other activities related to our intellectual property and lower bad debt charges the decrease in fiscal year 2002 is primarily due to lower bad debt charges and lower facilities expenses resulting from the sublease of one of our buildings partially offset by an increase in professional services related to patent prosecution and other activities related to our intellectual property 19

million in fiscal year 2002 and 20 million in fiscal year 2001 the decrease in fiscal year 2003 was primarily due to realized losses on sales of investments declining interest rates and interest income and an increase in foreign currency transaction losses the decrease in fiscal year 2002 was related to declining interest rates and investment income   provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes was 09 million 05 million and 41 million for fiscal years 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively the provision for income taxes represents foreign taxes related to our international operation with the exception of fiscal year 2001 which includes a charge of 34 million to provide a full valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets no federal or state income taxes were provided in fiscal years 2002 or 2003 20 liquidity and capital resources   we have funded our operations with our cash balances cash generated from operations and proceeds from public offerings    we consider all highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents totaled 104 million at the end of fiscal year 2003 compared to 208 million at the end of fiscal year 2002 and 183 million at the end of fiscal year 2001   cash provided by operating activities during fiscal year 2003 was 146 million compared to 95 million in fiscal year 2002 and cash used in operating activities was 118 million in fiscal year 2001 cash provided by operating activities in fiscal years 2003 and 2002 resulted primarily from cash generated from net income after adjusting for noncash charges changes in operating assets and liabilities and an increase in deferred revenue due to an increase in the renewal of service and support contracts by existing customers cash used in operating activities in fiscal year 2001 resulted primarily from operating losses partially offset by a decrease in net accounts receivable   cash used in investing activities was 381 million for the fiscal year 2003 127 million for fiscal year 2002 and 247 million for fiscal year 2001 the cash used in investing activities in fiscal year 2003 was primarily the

commitments consisted of obligations outstanding under operating leases in april 2000 we amended and restated the lease agreement relating to two buildings for our corporate headquarters the lease

  critical accounting policies   our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions   we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements   revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with the guidance provided under statement of position sop no 972 “software revenue recognition” and sop no 989 “modification of sop no 972 software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions” statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 48 “revenue recognition when right of return exists” and securities and exchange commission or sec staff accounting bulleting sab no 101 “revenue recognition in financial statements”   we sell products through resellers oems and other channel partners as well as directly to end users under similar terms we recognize product revenue upon shipment net of estimated returns provided that collection is determined to be probable and no significant obligations remain product revenues from oem agreements are recognized based on reporting of sales from the oem partner whenever a software license hardware installation and postcontract customer support or pcs elements are combined into a package with a single “bundled” price a portion of the sales price is allocated to each element of the bundled elements based on their respective fair values as determined when the individual elements are sold separately revenues from the license of software are recognized when the software has been shipped and the customer is obligated to pay for the software when rights of return are present and we cannot estimate returns we recognize revenue when such rights of return lapse revenues for pcs are recognized on a straightline basis over the service contract term pcs includes rights to upgrades when and if available a limited period of telephone support updates and bug fixes installation revenue is recognized when the product has been installed at the customer’s site consulting services are customarily billed at fixed rates plus outofpocket expenses and revenues are recognized when the consulting has been completed training revenue is recognized when the training has been completed   our ordinary payment terms to our domestic customers are net 30 days our ordinary payment terms to our international customers are net 30 to 90 days based on normal and customary trade practices in the individual markets we have offered extended payment terms beyond ordinary terms to some customers for these arrangements revenue is recognized when payments become due   reserve for doubtful accounts estimates are used in determining our allowance for doubtful accounts and are based on a percentage of our accounts receivable by aging category in determining these percentages we evaluate historical writeoffs current trends in the credit quality of our customer base as well as changes in the credit policies we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition and generally do not require any collateral if there is a deterioration of a major customer’s credit worthiness or actual defaults are higher than our historical experience our allowance for doubtful accounts may not be insufficient 22   reserve for product returns product returns are estimated based on historical experience by type of product and are recorded at the time revenues are recognized in some instances product revenue from distributors is subject to agreements allowing rights of return accordingly we reduce recognized revenue for estimated future returns at the time revenue is recorded when rights of return are present and we cannot estimate returns revenue is recognized when such rights lapse the estimates for returns are adjusted periodically based upon changes in historical rates of returns inventory in the distribution channel and other related factors it is possible that these estimates will change in the future or that the actual amounts could vary from our estimates and result in reductions to recognized revenues   reserve for excess or obsolete inventory we currently reserve for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management additional inventory charges may be required   reserve for warranties a warranty reserve is established based on our historical experience and an estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date while we believe that our warranty reserve is adequate and that the judgment applied is appropriate such amounts estimated to be due and payable could differ materially from what will actually transpire in the future   income tax valuation allowance the company has net deferred tax assets at september 30 2003 totaling approximately 307 million which are fully offset by a valuation allowance due to management’s determination that the criteria for recognition have not been met in the event management were to determine that the company would be able to realize its net deferred tax assets in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be made increasing net income or decreasing net loss in the period in which such a determination was made   as of september 30 2003 approximately 127 million of the valuation allowance related to the company’s net operating loss carry forwards is derived from the tax benefits of stock option deductions at such time as the valuation allowance related to their deductions is released the benefits will be credited to additional paid in capital   purchase price allocation during 2003 the company acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of uroam inc for cash of 25 million the company also incurred 24 million of direct transaction costs for a total purchase price of 274 million the total purchase price was allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair value the excess of the purchase price over the fair value was recorded as goodwill the fair value assigned to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed were based upon estimates and assumptions developed by management and other information compiled by management recent accounting pronouncements   in may 2003 fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard no 150 “accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liability and equity” sfas no 150 sfas no 150 establishes standards for how companies classify and measure certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity sfas no 150 is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may 31 2003 the adoption of this standard did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements   in april 2003 fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 149 “amendment of statement 133 on derivative instruments and hedging activities” sfas no 149 which is generally effective for contracts entered into or modified after june 30 2003 and for hedging relationships designated after june 30 2003 sfas no 149 clarifies under what circumstances a contract with an initial net 23 investment meets the characteristic of a derivative as discussed in statement of financial accounting standards no 133 when a derivative contains a financing component amends the definition of an “underlying” to conform it to the language used in fasb interpretation no 45 “guarantor accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others” and amends certain other existing pronouncements the adoption of this standard did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 

  in january 2003 fasb issued interpretation no 46 fin no 46 “consolidation of variable interest entities” which addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities that either 1 do not have sufficient equity investment at risk to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support or 2 the company will hold a significant variable interest in or have significant involvement with an existing variable interest entity the adoption of this interpretation did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements   in november 2002 fasb issued interpretation no 45 fin no 45 “guarantor’s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others” which addresses the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under guarantees fin no 45 also requires the recognition of a liability by a guarantor at the inception of certain guarantees that are entered into or modified after december 31 2002 the additional disclosures required by fin no 45 have been included in the notes to our consolidated financial statements risk factors   in addition to the other information in this report the following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating our company and its business our success depends on sales and continued innovation of our bigip product line   for the fiscal year ended september 30 2003 we derived 828 of our product revenues from sales of our bigip product line we expect to derive a significant portion of our net revenues from sales of our bigip products in the future implementation of our strategy depends upon bigip being able to solve critical network availability and performance problems of our customers if bigip is unable to solve these problems for our customers or if we are unable to sustain the high levels of innovation in bigip’s product feature set needed to maintain leadership in what will continue to be a competitive market environment our business and results of operations will be harmed our success depends on our timely development of new products and features and proper management of the timing of the life cycle of our products   we expect the secure application traffic management market to be characterized by rapid technological change frequent new product introductions changes in customer requirements and evolving industry standards our continued success depends on our ability to identify and develop new products and new features for our existing products to meet the demands of these changes and for those products and features to be accepted by our existing and target customers if we are unable to identify develop and deploy new products and new product features on a timely basis or if those products do not gain market acceptance our business and results of operations may be harmed   the current life cycle of our products is typically 12 to 24 months the introduction of new products or product enhancements may shorten the life cycle of our existing products or replace sales of some of our current products thereby offsetting the benefit of even a successful product introduction and may cause customers to defer purchasing our existing products in anticipation of the new products this could harm our operating results by decreasing sales increasing our inventory levels of older products and exposing us to greater risk of product obsolescence we have also experienced and may in the future experience delays in developing and releasing new products and product enhancements this has led to and may in the future lead to delayed sales increased expenses and lower quarterly revenue than anticipated also in the development of our products we have experienced delays in the prototyping of our products which in turn has led to delays in 24 product introductions in addition complexity and difficulties in managing product transitions at the endoflife stage of a product can create excess inventory of components associated with the outgoing product that can lead to increased expenses any or all of the above problems could materially harm our business and operating results 

we may not be able to compete effectively in the emerging secure application traffic management market   the markets we serve are new rapidly evolving and highly competitive and we expect competition to persist and intensify in the future our principal competitors in the secure application traffic management market include cisco systems inc nortel networks corporation foundry networks inc netscaler inc radware ltd and netscreen technologies inc we expect to continue to face additional competition as new participants enter the traffic management market in addition larger companies with significant resources brand recognition and sales channels may form alliances with or acquire competing traffic management solutions and emerge as significant competitors potential competitors may bundle their products or incorporate an internet traffic management component into existing products in a manner that discourages users from purchasing our products potential customers may also choose to purchase additional or larger servers instead of our products our quarterly and annual operating results are volatile and may cause our stock price to fluctuate   our quarterly and annual operating results have varied significantly in the past and will vary significantly in the future which makes it difficult for us to predict our future operating results in particular we anticipate that the size of customer orders may increase as we continue to focus on larger business accounts a delay in the recognition of revenue even from just one account may have a significant negative impact on our results of operations for a given period in the past a majority of our sales have been realized near the end of a quarter accordingly a delay in an anticipated sale past the end of a particular quarter may negatively impact our results of operations for that quarter or in some cases that year furthermore we base our decisions regarding our operating expenses on anticipated revenue trends and our expense levels are relatively fixed consequently if revenue levels fall below our expectations our net income will decrease because only a small portion of our operating expenses vary with our revenues   we believe that periodtoperiod comparisons of our results of operations are not meaningful and should not be relied upon as indicators of future performance our operating results may be below the expectations of securities analysts and investors in future quarters or years our failure to meet these expectations will likely harm the market price of our common stock 

 

   we anticipate that the average selling prices of our products will decrease in the future in response to competitive pricing pressures increased sales discounts new product introductions by us or our competitors or other factors therefore in order to maintain our gross profits we must develop and introduce new products and product enhancements on a timely basis and continually reduce our product costs our failure to do so will cause our net revenue and gross profits to decline which will harm our business and results of operations in addition we may experience substantial periodtoperiod fluctuations in future operating results due to the erosion of our average selling prices 

 

   our products have a lengthy sales cycle which is difficult to predict historically our sales cycle has ranged from approximately two to three months and has tended to lengthen as we have increasingly focused our sales efforts on the enterprise market also as our distribution strategy has evolved into more of a channel model utilizing valueadded resellers distributors and systems integrators the level of variability in the length of sales cycle across transactions has increased and made it more difficult to predict the timing of many of our sales transactions sales of our bigip and 3dns products require us to educate potential customers in their use and benefits sales of our products are subject to delays from the lengthy internal budgeting approval and 25 competitive evaluation processes that large corporations and governmental entities may require for example customers frequently begin by evaluating our products on a limited basis and devote time and resources to testing our products before they decide whether or not to purchase customers may also defer orders as a result of anticipated releases of new products or enhancements by our competitors or us as a result our products have an unpredictable sales cycle that contributes to the uncertainty of our future operating results 

 

   we rely on a third party contract manufacturer to assemble our products we outsource the manufacturing of our hardware platforms to this contract manufacturer who assembles these hardware platforms to our specifications we have experienced minor delays in shipments from contract manufacturers in the past however if we experience major delays in the future or other problems such as inferior quality and insufficient quantity of product any one or a combination of these factors may harm our business and results of operations the inability of our contract manufacturer to provide us with adequate supplies of our products or the loss of our contract manufacturer may cause a delay in our ability to fulfill orders while we obtain a replacement manufacturer and may harm our business and results of operations in particular because we subcontract substantially all of our manufacturing to a single contract manufacturer with whom we do not have a longterm contract any termination loss or impairment in our arrangement with this single source of hardware assembly or any impairment of their facilities or operations would harm our business financial condition and results of operation   if the demand for our products grows we will need to increase our raw material and component purchases contract manufacturing capacity and internal test and quality functions any disruptions in product flow may limit our revenue may harm our competitive position and may result in additional costs or cancellation of orders by our customers 

 

   we currently purchase several hardware components used in the assembly of our products from a number of single or limited sources lead times for these components vary significantly any interruption or delay in the supply of any of these hardware components or the inability to procure a similar component from alternate sources at acceptable prices within a reasonable time may delay assembly and sales of our products and hence our revenues and may harm our business and results of operations 

 

   we rely on a combination of patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure of confidential and proprietary information to protect our intellectual property rights despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology monitoring unauthorized use of our products is difficult and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of our technology particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states   our industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights we are actively involved in disputes and licensing discussions with others regarding their claimed proprietary rights and cannot assure you that we will always successfully defend ourselves against such claims if we are found to infringe the proprietary rights of others or if we otherwise settle such claims we could be compelled to pay damages or royalties and either obtain a license to those intellectual property rights or alter our products so that they no longer infringe upon such proprietary rights any license could be very expensive to obtain or may not be available at all similarly changing our products or processes to avoid infringing the rights of others may be costly or impractical in addition we have initiated and may in the future initiate claims or litigation against third parties for 26 infringement of our proprietary rights including infringement of a patent we hold on our “cookie persistence” technology to determine the scope and validity of our proprietary rights or those of our competitors any of these claims whether claims that we are infringing the proprietary rights of others or vice versa with or without merit may be timeconsuming result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel or require us to cease using infringing technology develop noninfringing technology or enter into royalty or licensing agreements further our license agreements typically require us to indemnify our customers and resellers for infringement actions related to our technology which could cause us to become involved in infringement claims made against our customers or resellers any of the abovedescribed circumstances relating to intellectual property rights disputes could result in our business and results of operations being harmed 

 

   a change in accounting policies can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective new pronouncements and varying interpretations of pronouncements have occurred with frequency and may occur in the future changes to existing rules or the questioning of current practices may adversely affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business   in particular if we are required to record stock option grants as compensation expense on our income statement our profitability may be reduced significantly the current methodology for expensing such stock options is based on among other things the historical volatility of the underlying stock our stock price has been historically volatile therefore the adoption of an accounting standard requiring companies to expense stock options would negatively impact our profitability and may adversely impact our stock price in addition the adoption of such a standard could limit our ability to continue to use stock options as an incentive and retention tool which could in turn hurt our ability to recruit employees and retain existing employees   similarly while we believe our current revenue recognition policies and practices are consistent with applicable accounting standards current revenue recognition accounting standards and accounting guidance with respect to such standards are subject to change such changes could lead to unanticipated changes in our current revenue accounting practices and such changes could significantly reduce our future revenues and earnings which would likely have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock we may not be able to sustain or develop new distribution relationships and a reduction or delay in sales to a significant distribution partner could hurt our business   our sales strategy requires that we establish and maintain multiple distribution channels in the united states and internationally through leading industry resellers original equipment manufacturers or oems systems integrators internet service providers and other channel partners we have a limited number of agreements with companies in these channels and we may not be able to increase our number of distribution relationships or maintain our existing relationships if we are unable to establish and maintain our indirect sales channels our business and results of operations will be harmed in addition one distributor of our products accounted for 126 of our net revenue for the fiscal year ended september 30 2003 during the fiscal year ended september 30 2002 no single reseller or customer accounted for more than 10 of our net revenue a substantial reduction or delay in sales of our products to this or any other key distribution partner could harm our business operating results and financial condition undetected software errors may harm our business and results of operations   software products frequently contain undetected errors when first introduced or as new versions are released we have experienced these errors in the past in connection with new products and product upgrades we expect that these errors will be found from time to time in new or enhanced products after commencement of commercial shipments these problems may cause us to incur significant warranty and repair costs divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts and cause significant 27 customer relations problems we may also be subject to liability claims for damages related to product errors while we carry insurance policies covering this type of liability these policies may not provide sufficient protection should a claim be asserted a material product liability claim may harm our business and results of operations 

  our products must successfully operate with products from other vendors as a result when problems occur in a network it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem the occurrence of software errors whether caused by our products or another vendor’s products may result in the delay or loss of market acceptance of our products the occurrence of any of these problems may harm our business and results of operations our expansion into international markets may not succeed   we intend to continue expanding into international markets international sales represented 349 of our net revenues for the fiscal year ended september 30 2003 322 of our net revenues for the fiscal year ended september 30 2002 and 333 of our net revenues for the fiscal year ended september 30 2001 we have engaged sales personnel throughout europe and the asia pacific region our continued growth will require further expansion of our international operations in the european asia pacific and other markets if we are unable to expand our international operations successfully and in a timely manner our business and results of operations may be harmed such expansion may be more difficult or take longer than we anticipate and we may not be able to successfully market sell deliver and support our products internationally our operating results are exposed to risks associated with international commerce   as our international sales increase our operating results become more exposed to international operating risks these risks include risks related to potential recessions in economies outside the united states foreign currency exchange rates managing foreign sales offices regulatory political or economic conditions in specific countries military conflict or terrorist activities changes in laws and tariffs inadequate protection of intellectual property rights in foreign countries foreign regulatory requirements and natural disasters all of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business in particular in fiscal year 2003 we derived 138 of our total revenue from the japanese market and this revenue is dependent on a number of factors outside our control including the viability and success of our resellers and the strength of the japanese economy which has been weak in recent years acquisitions including our recent acquisition of substantially all of the assets of uroam inc present many risks and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that are contemplated at the time of the transaction   with respect to our july 2003 acquisition of substantially all of the assets of uroam inc as well as any other future acquisitions we may undertake we may find that the acquired assets do not further our business strategy as expected or that we paid more than what the assets are later worth or that economic conditions change all of which may generate future impairment charges there may be difficulty integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired business and we may have difficulty retaining the key personnel of the acquired business in the case of the assets acquired from uroam inc because it was based in northern california and because the employees we hired in connection with the acquisition were not relocated to seattle the abovementioned integration and personnel retention issues represent a particular risk to us we may have difficulty in incorporating the acquired technologies or products with our existing product lines our ongoing business and management’s attention may be disrupted or diverted by transition or integration issues and the complexity of managing geographically and culturally diverse locations we may have difficulty maintaining uniform standards controls procedures and policies across locations we may experience significant problems or liabilities associated with the product quality technology and other matters   our inability to successfully operate and integrate newlyacquired businesses appropriately effectively and in a timely manner or to retain key personnel of uroam inc or any other acquired business could have a material adverse effect on our ability to take advantage of further growth in demand for integrated traffic 28 management and security solutions and other advances in technology as well as on our revenues gross margins and expenses 

our success depends on our key personnel and our ability to attract train and retain qualified marketing and sales professional services and customer support personnel   our success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our key management product development sales marketing and finance personnel many of which may be difficult to replace the complexity of our secure application traffic management products and their integration into existing networks and ongoing support as well as the sophistication of our sales and marketing effort requires us to retain highly trained professional services customer support and sales personnel in spite of the economic downturn competition for qualified professional services customer support and sales personnel in our industry is intense because of the limited number of people available with the necessary technical skills and understanding of our products our ability to retain and hire these personnel may be adversely affected by volatility or reductions in the price of our common stock since these employees are generally granted stock options the loss of services of any of our key personnel the inability to retain and attract qualified personnel in the future or delays in hiring qualified personnel may harm our business and results of operations we face litigation risks   we are a party to lawsuits in the normal course of our business litigation in general and intellectual property and securities litigation in particular can be expensive lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations moreover the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict we believe that we have defenses in the lawsuits pending against us and we are vigorously contesting these allegations responding to the allegations has been and probably will be expensive and timeconsuming for us an unfavorable resolution of the lawsuits could adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition antitakeover provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us   our board of directors has the authority to issue up to 10000000 shares of preferred stock and to determine the price rights preferences privileges and restrictions including voting rights of those shares without any further vote or action by the stockholders the rights of the holders of common stock may be subject to and may be adversely affected by the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future the issuance of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a change of control of our company without further action by our stockholders and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of the holders of common stock further certain provisions of our bylaws including a provision limiting the ability of stockholders to raise matters at a meeting of stockholders without giving advance notice may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or management of our company which could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock in addition our articles of incorporation provide for a staggered board which may make it more difficult for a third party to gain control of our board of directors similarly state antitakeover laws in the state of washington related to corporate takeovers may prevent or delay a change of control of our company 

item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk   interest rate risk our cash equivalents consist of highquality securities as specified in our investment policy guidelines the policy limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue or issuer to a maximum of 20 of the total portfolio with the exception of treasury securities commercial paper and money market funds which are exempt from size limitation the policy requires investments in securities that mature in two years or less with the average maturity being one year or less these securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if interest rates increase a decrease of one percent in the average interest would have resulted in a decrease of approximately 07 million in our interest income 29    foreign currency risk the majority of our sales and expenses are denominated in us dollars and as a result we have not experienced significant foreign currency transaction gains and losses to date while we have conducted some transactions in foreign currencies during the fiscal year ended september 30 2003 and expect to continue to do so we do not anticipate that foreign currency transaction gains or losses will be significant at our current level of operations however as we continue to expand our operations internationally they may become significant in the future we have not engaged in foreign currency hedging to date however we may do so in the future 30

 item 1 business description of business   f5 networks provides integrated products and services to manage control and optimize internet traffic our core products the bigip® controller 3dns® controller and the bigip link controller help manage traffic to servers and network devices in a way that maximizes availability and throughput our unique icontrol™ architecture integrates our products and also allows our customers to integrate them with other third party products our solutions address many elements required for successful internet and intranet business applications including high availability high performance intelligent load balancing fault tolerance security and streamlined manageability industry background   since the late 1990’s businesses have responded to the power flexibility and economy of internet protocol ip based networks by deploying new ipbased applications upgrading their clientserver applications to new ipenabled versions and ipenabling legacy applications during the next several years this process will likely accelerate as web services enable businesses to build applications quickly and easily by integrating software modules available from many different sources in addition the growth of internet usage will continue to be driven by new applications such as voice over ip voip and the increasing popularity of mobile internet access through wireless devices such as cell phones pdas and notebook computers   internet protocol specifies that all data transmitted across the internet must be split into packets in addition to its contents or payload which corresponds to the application layer layer 7 of the open systems interconnect osi reference model each packet has a header that identifies the source and destination of the packet the osi reference model is the framework that describes and defines how networked systems communicate with one another in the simplest implementation of the osi model header information is added to the contents at the source computer and processed and stripped by the destination computer in common practice however these functions are performed by network routers and switches that the contents email message web page transaction data etc pass through enroute from source to destination in addition as more and more organizations have begun to deploy a growing variety of ipenabled applications there has been increasing demand for layer 7 technology that can read the entire contents of a packetized transmission and make intelligent decisions based on a dynamic set of business rules about how to handle the transmission and where to route it to ensure the availability and optimal performance of applications servers and the network   because the functions performed at layers 2  4 are generally predictable and largely repetitive nearly all devices designed for layer 2  4 processing are hardwarebased and optimized for speed most manufacturers of layer 7 devices have also opted for hardwarebased solutions limiting the ability of their products to adapt to the rapidly changing requirements of layer 7 traffic management   through the end of 2000 the bulk of traffic on the internet was web http traffic with the growth of online banking brokerage accounts and other financial services the need to guarantee the security of 2   information and transactions had also led to the emergence of the secure socket layer ssl encryption as the standard for secure web traffic during the interaction between a user and a financial application data sent from the user to the server is typically encrypted by the user’s browser and decrypted by the server and this process is reversed for data sent back to the user the use of ssl has continued to grow with the proliferation of webbased applications that require secure transactions because ssl processing is computeintensive it places a significant and costly burden on servers as a result customers who use it are eager to find ways to offload ssl processing to faster and less expensive devices 

  as the growth of ipenabled business applications accelerates there is an emerging need for technology to manage the flow of application traffic both within corporate intranets and across the internet current traffic management products have provided functionality and flexibility to manage web http traffic f5 products differentiate by their capability to intercept inspect and act on the contents of traffic from other types of ipenabled applications such as database applications customer relationship management crm applications enterprise resource planning erp applications web services and voip   we are an industry leader in application traffic management enabling enterprises and service providers to optimize any missioncritical ipbased application or web service providing secure and predictable delivery of application traffic in an unpredictable environment through our unique open icontrol™ application programming interface api thirdparty applications and network devices can take an active role in shaping ip network traffic delivering application aware networks that allow customers to direct traffic based on their exact business requirements   our unique technology inspects ip traffic down to the packet payload level and can direct traffic according to the needs of each application its powerful offloading inspection and processing of applicationlevel transactions is faster than any other product on the market it is also the first solution that can automatically respond to act upon and prevent ever changing application security threats — providing a coordinated line of defense while making the most of existing network security products   the result for customers is that bestpractice architectures can be built quickly and inexpensively without buying more servers deploying multiple products to handle different applications or attempting to build these functions in the applications themselves enterprises and service providers can readily adapt to changing business demands and conditions quickly and costeffectively in this way our products reduce implementation risks improve reliability and lower it costs while creating a network that is truly “applicationaware” f5 products   our core product is the bigip controller for localarea application traffic management bigip software runs on a variety of intelbased hardware platforms including ip application switches and server appliances manufactured by us our original equipment manufacturers oem’s and blade servers manufactured by server vendors such as dell fujitsusiemens hewlettpackard ibm and rlx technologies   in terms of the osi reference model the core of bigip is sophisticated software that manages ip traffic at layer 7 also known as the application layer f5’s bigip application switches also perform layer 23 switching and industryleading layer 4 switching but it is the superior performance and functionality of the bigip layer 7 traffic management software that distinguishes it from competing products sold by cisco systems nortel networks and others   in contrast to the tasks associated with layers 2  4 layer 7 which encompasses layer 5  6 functions as well is complex and variable switching devices for layers 2  4 merely ensure that packets of information sent over the internet arrive at the destination to which they are addressed and that they are reassembled in the correct sequence in many ways the kinds of functions carried out at layers 2  4 are analogous to those carried out by the postal service in picking up and delivering mail layer 7 corresponds to the content of the mail and the interaction between the sender and receiver   our other products include 3dns controller and bigip link controller 3dns allows enterprises with geographically dispersed web sites to direct traffic to a particular web site in accordance with customized business rules or to redirect traffic to an available web site if one of their sites becomes overloaded 3   or is shut down for any reason link controller allows enterprises with more than one isp to manage the use of their available bandwidth to minimize costs while ensuring the highest quality of service 3dns and link controller are sold separately on individual ip application switches and server appliances or bundled with bigip on a single appliance or ip application switch 

  in early 2001 we recognized a growing need for traffic management products that could not only communicate with one another but with the increasing number and variety of ipenabled enterprise applications being deployed by large organizations   in response to that need we published the icontrol soapxml interface in a free software development kit sdk that allows customers and independent software vendors isvs to modify their programs to communicate with our products this enabled the applications themselves to control the flow of traffic on the network without human intervention the use of icontrol reduces or eliminates the need for human involvement significantly reducing the cost of performing basic network functions and dramatically reducing the likelihood of error adding this extra functionality to their products is attractive to isvs and since the introduction of the icontrol sdk we have formed relationships with dozens of software developers including microsoft oracle bea tivoli japan hewlett packard siebel and computer associates although we do not derive revenue from icontrol itself the sale of icontrolenabled isv products helps promote and often leads directly to the sale of our products   currently we manufacture two lines of systems server appliances and ip application switches   server appliances   server appliances were our original products and continue to account for a little more than half of our systems revenue the bigip 520 and 540 server appliances are equipped with intelprocessors for highspeed layer 47 processing and are designed to accommodate addin cards for fast integrated ssl encryption and decryption   since integrated ssl acceleration was introduced as a feature in our platforms in early 2000 it has been an important driver of system sales by offloading computeintensive ssl processing from servers to our traffic management systems customers can free up valuable server space for other applications in addition decrypting transmissions in conjunction with layer 7 traffic management allows bigip to inspect the contents and send them to the best available server based on the nature of the contents and any rules that apply   ip application switches   we introduced our first ip application switch the bigip 5000 in september 2001 in response to customer demand for systems with an increased number of ports allowing them to be connected to many different types of network devices and integrated layer 23 switching and ssl processing capability in january 2002 we introduced a midrange version of the ip application switch called bigip 2000 in october 2002 we introduced an upgraded and expanded line of ip application switches including the highend bigip 5100 the bigip 2400 midrange product with integrated layer 4 switching on an asic developed by our hardware team and the bigip 1000 lowend switch f5 technology   from our inception we have been committed to the belief that the complexity of layer 7 traffic management requires a software solution when we were founded in 1996 our initial products were designed to loadbalance internet traffic across multiple web servers shortly after our first products were introduced we began adding health checking and other highavailability features that distinguished our products from hardwarebased products manufactured by competitors who emphasized speed over functionality in late 1999 for example we introduced bigip’s patented “cookie persistence” capability a key feature of the software that establishes a link between a user and a specific server and enables the user to return to that server if heshe leaves or the connection is broken before a transaction is completed   as ip traffic has evolved and the demands placed on layer 7 traffic management have increased our softwarebased technology has enabled us to adapt quickly when session initiation protocol sip a new 4   standard for internet conferencing voip and instant messaging im was introduced in mid2001 we added sip support to bigip within four months 

  the fact that all of our products are softwarebased differentiates us from competing products in a number of other important ways first our software can be easily ported to intelbased hardware platforms other than those manufactured by us this has enabled us to license the software to oem partners who resell it on their own products in addition it has created an opportunity for us to sell products that run on blade servers and manage traffic across all the blades currently bigip blade controller has been approved to run on blades manufactured by dell fujitsusiemens hewlettpackard and rlx technologies   from a network administrator’s perspective one of the key benefits of a softwarebased solution is the ability to write scripts that incorporate specific business rules into the software for example if an organization has three help desks located in bombay san francisco and london all email requests for help can be directed to a single 3dns device that has been scripted to redirect the requests to different help desks at different times of the day similarly a bigip device managing traffic to an ecommerce web site can be scripted to recognize transmissions from preferred customers and route them to a server that will expedite their transactions   one of the most important features of our softwarebased products is “application awareness” during development bigip 3dns and our other products were designed using a common architecture called icontrol with a common interface that allows them to communicate with one another that in itself distinguishes our products from others in the market with the release of bigip version 45 in october 2002 we expanded the “application awareness” of our technology introducing a new set of capabilities that further distance our products from the competition’s by providing the first application traffic management solution on the market key features of this new technology are   universal inspection engine uie  — uie enables bigip to examine the entire contents of a transmission and identify any value within the header and payload uie can recognize virtually any piece of data such as a cell phone number a membership id an access code etc in any stream of application data including soap xml simple object access protocol extensible markup language the standard protocols that enable web services to communicate with one another   irules  — using the icontrol interface network administrators and applications themselves can write commands that tell bigip to direct persist or filter traffic based on any of the values identified by uie   dynamic security control architecture dsca  — dcsa provides centralized security enforcement that enables networks to respond quickly and adapt easily to new security threats product development   our future success depends on our ability to maintain technology leadership in application traffic management by constantly improving our current products and by developing new products to meet the changing needs of our customers our product development group which is divided along product lines employs a standard process for the development documentation and quality control of software and systems designed to meet these goals   product development also engages in technology partnerships with software and component manufacturers that allow us to integrate industry standard technology with our own products during the past two years we have had a close working relationship with broadcom corporation which manufactures the layer 23 switches and ssl asics used in our family of application switches we also have a technology partnership with nokia focused on developing technology for mobile content delivery networks   our software engineering group is located in our headquarters in seattle washington our hardware engineering group is located in spokane washington electronic communication allows the members of both teams to collaborate closely with one another on specific projects   our product development expenses for fiscal 2002 2001 and 2000 were 180 million 174 million and 145 million respectively during fiscal 2003 we expect to continue to increase research and development expenses as our future success is dependent on the continued enhancement of our current products and our ability to develop new technologically advanced products that meet the changing needs of our customers 5   customers   prior to fiscal 2001 our customer base was comprised primarily of internet service providers web hosting companies and internet startups engaged in ecommerce in the first half of fiscal 2001 we began focusing our marketing and sales efforts on large enterprises which currently account for the majority of our revenue although we do not target specific vertical markets enterprise customers in financial services manufacturing transportation and mobile telecommunications make up the largest percentage of our customer base marketing   we engage in a number of marketing programs and initiatives aimed at promoting our brand and creating market awareness of our technology and products these include actively participating in industry trade shows and briefing industry analysts and members of the trade press on our latest products and on new business and technology partnerships in addition we market our products to chief information officers and other information technology professionals through targeted advertising direct mail and highprofile web events   the cornerstone of our marketing strategy is to build strong partnerships with large wellestablished companies that are leaders in their industry by partnering with these firms we have been able to gain market mindshare and access to large accounts that we would not have been able to achieve on our own currently we have three principal types of marketing partnerships that overlap to varying degrees with our sales channel partnerships these include   icontrol partnerships — we have established relationships with various independent software vendors isvs who have adapted their applications to interact with our products via the icontrol interface icontrol enhances the functionality of their applications by enabling them to control the network as a result customers who purchase icontrolenabled applications have an incentive to purchase our products in order to take advantage of their enhanced functionality   blade server partnerships — we have marketing partnerships with various system vendors dell fujitsusiemens hewlett packard and rlx technologies who have approved bigip blade controller to run on their blade servers market focus and strategy are different for each partnership in some of these partnerships vendors andor their channels resell blade controller to their customers others represent pure marketing relationships   oem partnerships — we license our software to dell and nokia who resell it on their own lines of cobranded traffic management products in conjunction with these arrangements the company participates in joint marketing programs with both companies sales   we sell our software systems and services to large enterprise customers through a variety of channels including oems distributors valueadded resellers var’s and system integrators si’s in north america we also sell our products and services to major accounts through our own direct sales force oem partners license our software and resell on their own cobranded products distributors var’s and si’s purchase our software and systems and resell them to their customers in most cases service contracts are negotiated directly with the customer typically the company’s agreements with its channel partners are not exclusive and do not prevent them from selling competitive products these agreements typically have terms of one year with no obligation to renew and typically do not provide for exclusive sales territories or minimum purchase requirements   our field sales people are located in major cities throughout the united states europe and asia the inside sales team generates and qualifies leads for regional sales managers and help manage accounts by serving as a liaison between the field and internal corporate resources field systems engineers also support our regional sales managers by participating in joint sales calls and providing presale technical resources as needed 6     the majority of our field sales people work closely with our channel partners to assist them in selling our products to their customers in north america major account teams are assigned to large enterprise customers who prefer to work directly with us customer service and technical support   our ability to provide consistent highquality customer service and technical support is a key factor in attracting and retaining customers prior to the installation of our products our services personnel work with customers to analyze their network needs and determine the best way to deploy our products and configure product features and functions to meet those needs our service personnel also provide onsite installation and training services to help customers make optimal use of product features and functions installation generally occurs within 30 days of product shipment to the customer   at the time of purchase customers typically purchase a oneyear maintenance contract renewable annually that entitles them to an array of services provided by our technical support team maintenance services provided under the contract include online updates upgrades and remote support through a 24x7 help desk our technical support team also offers seminars and training classes for customers on the configuration and use of products including local and wide area network system administration and management in addition they provide a full range of consulting services including comprehensive network management documentation and performance analysis and capacity planning to assist in predicting future network requirements manufacturing   we outsource the manufacturing of our preconfigured hardware platforms to a contract manufacturer solectron who assembles each product to our specifications hardware platforms consist primarily of an intelbased computing platform custom and commodity asics a rackmount enclosure system and a customdesigned front panel solectron also installs our application traffic management software onto these hardware platforms and conducts functionality testing quality assurance and documentation control prior to shipping our products   our agreement with solectron allows them to procure component inventory on our behalf based upon a rolling production forecast subcontractors supply solectron with standard parts and components for our products based on our production forecast we are contractually obligated to purchase component inventory that our contract manufacturer procures in accordance with the forecast unless we give notice of order cancellation outside of applicable lead times for any completed product inventory carried by solectron beyond 30 days solectron will charge us a monthly carrying fee of 15 alternatively we have the option to purchase inventory held by solectron beyond 30 days to avoid incurring related carrying charges as protection against component shortages and to provide replacement parts for our service teams we also stock limited supplies of certain key components for our products competition   the internet traffic management market is relatively new rapidly evolving and highly competitive and competition in these markets is likely to persist and intensify our principal competitors in this market include cisco systems foundry networks nortel networks and radware   cisco systems has a product set similar to ours and holds the largest share of the market cisco has a longer operating history and significantly greater financial technical marketing and other resources than we do cisco also has a more extensive customer base and broader customer relationships including relationships with many of our current and potential customers in addition cisco has large wellestablished worldwide customer support and professional services organizations and a more extensive direct sales force and sales channels   because of our size market presence and resources cisco and other competitors may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements there is also the possibility that these companies may adopt aggressive pricing policies to gain market share as a 7   result our competitors pose a serious competitive threat that could undermine our ability to win new customers and maintain our existing customer base 

  to mitigate these threats and strengthen our competitive position we have focused on differentiating our products in two ways   emphasis on software  — our sophisticated layer 7 software delivers performance features and functionality that competing hardwarebased products cannot match because our technology is softwarebased we are also the only company whose traffic management solution has been certified to run on blade servers manufactured by leading hardware vendors   tight integration of software and commodity hardware  — our application switches combine into a single platform functions — layer 7 traffic management layer 2  4 switching ssl acceleration — that are typically available from competitors on two or more platforms this results in comparatively lower cost better performance easier deployment and simpler management for equivalent or better functionality intellectual property   we rely on a combination of patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights we currently have issued patents and applications pending for various aspects of our technology we also enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees consultants and corporate partners and control access to and distribution of our software documentation and other proprietary information however despite our best efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology   in addition to our own proprietary software we incorporate software licensed from several thirdparty sources into our products these licenses generally renew automatically on an annual basis we believe that alternative technologies for this licensed software are available both domestically and internationally employees   as of september 30 2002 we employed 467 fulltime persons including 127 in product development 192 in sales and

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend   the following management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and notes    net revenues total net revenues increased 10 in fiscal 2002 from fiscal 2001 compared to a decrease of 10 in fiscal 2001 from fiscal 2000 the increase in fiscal 2002 was due to higher product sales resulting from a modest recovery in demand for our products the increased product sales were partially offset by a decrease in service revenues resulting from changes in pricing and a higher percentage of our channel partners providing maintenance and installation services to endusers the decrease in fiscal 2001 revenues compared to fiscal 2000 was primarily due to lower product sales as a result of a downturn in the us economy in fiscal 2001   international revenues represented 32 33 and 19 of total sales in fiscal 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively the decrease in international sales as a percentage of net revenues was primarily due to lower sales in japan during fiscal 2002 fiscal 2001 was the first complete year for which we had subsidiaries in the asia pacific region that contributed to the increase in our international sales as a percentage of net revenues compared to fiscal 2000 we expect international sales will continue to represent a significant portion of net revenues although we cannot provide assurance that international sales as a percentage of net revenues will remain at current levels   sales of our bigip products represented 64 64 and 62 of total net revenues in fiscal 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively and we expect to derive a significant portion of our net revenues from sales of bigip in the future during fiscal 2002 and 2001 no single reseller or customer exceeded 10 of net revenue or our accounts receivable balance during fiscal 2000 one of our resellers exodus communications accounted for 14 of net revenue and 8 of our accounts receivable balance   product revenues product revenues were 826 million for the fiscal year ended september 30 2002 compared to 786 million for the year ended september 30 2001 and 880 million for the year ended september 30 2000 the 50 increase in fiscal year 2002 was primarily the result of strong sales in north america partially offset by decreased sales in japan the 106 decrease in fiscal year 2001 compared to fiscal 2000 was primarily the result of reduced demand for our products in the us due to a general slow down in the us economy   service revenues service revenues were 257 million for the fiscal year ended september 30 2002 compared to 287 million for the fiscal year ended september 30 2001 and 207 million for the year ended september 30 2000 service revenue decreased by 106 in fiscal year 2002 primarily due to changes in pricing and a larger percentage of our resellers providing maintenance and installation to endusers partially offset by an increase in the renewal of service and support contracts by existing customers the 391 increase in service revenues in fiscal year 2001 compared to fiscal 2000 was primarily due to an increase in the installed base of our products and the renewal of service and support contracts 14      cost of product revenues cost of product revenues decreased 391 to 202 million for the year ended september 30 2002 from 332 million for the year ended september 30 2001 the cost of product revenues for fiscal 2000 totaled 247 million cost of product revenues decreased as a percent of net product revenue to 245 for fiscal year 2002 from 423 for fiscal year 2001 and 280 for fiscal year 2000 the decrease in fiscal 2002 was primarily the result of lower excess inventory charges and lower manufacturing costs partially offset by increased warranty costs further in fiscal 2002 we unified our supply chain with a single contract manufacturer and as result have improved our manufacturing efficiencies as well as realized lower component costs the increase in fiscal 2001 compared to fiscal 2000 was primarily the result of costs associated with product platform changes and 49 million of charges related to excess inventory and purchase commitments   cost of service revenues cost of service revenues decreased to 102 million for fiscal 2002 from 123 million for fiscal 2001 the cost of service revenues for fiscal 2000 totaled 79 million cost of service revenues decreased as a percent of net service revenues to 398 for fiscal year 2002 from 427 for fiscal year 2001 the decrease in fiscal 2002 relates primarily to improved operational efficiencies and a decrease in headcount and related costs cost of service revenues increased to 427 in fiscal 2001 compared to 383 for fiscal year 2000 the increase in cost of service revenue in fiscal 2001 compared to fiscal 2000 is due to an increase in customer base and an increase in personnel and the related costs  15     sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries commissions and related benefits of our sales and marketing staff costs of our marketing programs including public relations advertising and trade shows and an allocation of our facilities and depreciation expenses sales and marketing expenses decreased less than 10 to 506 million in fiscal 2002 from 508 million in fiscal 2001 the decrease in fiscal 2002 relates primarily to lower trade show and promotional activities and decreased business travel expenses partially offset by increased personnel costs as we continued to expand our international operations sales and marketing expenses increased to 508 million in fiscal 2001 from 369 million in fiscal year 2000 the increase in fiscal 2001 compared to fiscal 2000 was due to an increase in headcount and related costs and increased advertising and promotional activities we expect to continue to increase sales and marketing expenses in order to grow net revenues and expand our brand awareness   research and development research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related benefits for our product development personnel and an allocation of our facilities and depreciation expenses research and development expenses increased 32 to 180 million in fiscal 2002 from 174 million in fiscal 2001 and 145 million in fiscal year 2000 the increase in fiscal 2002 relates primarily to increased personnel related costs and expenses related to the development of new products the increase in fiscal year 2001 compared to fiscal 2000 relates primarily to personnel related costs and an increase in facilities costs related to the spokane office we expect to continue to increase research and development expenses as our future success is dependent on the continued enhancement of our current products and our ability to develop new technologically advanced products that meet the changing needs of our customers   general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries benefits and related costs of our executive finance information technology human resource and legal personnel thirdparty professional service fees bad debt charges and an allocation of our facilities and depreciation expenses general and administrative expenses decreased 199 to 150 million in fiscal 2002 from 188 million in fiscal 2001 the decrease in fiscal 2002 is primarily due to lower bad debt charges and lower facilities expenses resulting from the sublease of one of our buildings partially offset by an increase in professional services related to patent prosecution and other activities related to our intellectual property general and administrative expenses increased to 188 million in fiscal 2001 from 97 million in fiscal 2000 the increase in fiscal 2001 compared to fiscal 2000 related primarily to an increase in bad debt expense due to the bankruptcy filing by exodus communications and an increase in headcount and other payroll related costs   restructuring charges during the third quarter of fiscal 2002 we recorded a restructuring charge of 28 million in connection with management’s decision to exit the cache appliance business as a result of changes in the business we wrotedown certain assets consolidated operations and terminated 47 employees throughout all divisions of the company in july 2002 all identified employees had been notified and terminated resulting in an additional charge of 503000 related to employee separation costs   amortization of unearned compensation we have recorded a total of 83 million of stock compensation costs since our inception through september 30 2002 these charges represent the difference between the exercise price and the deemed fair value of certain stock options granted to our employees and outside directors these options generally vest ratably over a fouryear period we are amortizing these costs using an accelerated method as prescribed by fasb interpretation no 28 “fin no 28” and recorded stock compensation charges of 04 million 26 million and 21 million for the years ended september 30 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively 16      other income net other income net consists primarily of interest income and foreign currency transaction gains and losses other income net decreased 297 to 14 million in fiscal 2002 from 20 million in fiscal 2001 and 29 million in fiscal 2000 this decrease is primarily due to declining interest rates and investment income   provision for income taxes the income tax provision of 489000 reported in fiscal 2002 is due to foreign income taxes related to our international operations the income tax provision increased to 41 million in fiscal 2001 from 21 million in fiscal 2000 the increase in the provision for income taxes was caused by our decision to provide for a full valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets in fiscal 2001    from our inception through may 1999 we financed our operations and capital expenditures primarily through the sale of approximately 124 million in equity securities in june 1999 we completed an initial public offering of 2860000 shares of common stock and raised approximately 255 million net of offering costs in october 1999 we completed a secondary public offering of 500000 shares of common stock and raised approximately 314 million net of offering costs   on june 26 2001 we entered into a common stock and warrant purchase agreement with nokia finance international bv “nfi” under this agreement we issued and sold to nfi i 2466421 shares of common stock and ii warrants the “warrants” to purchase additional shares of common stock we received total proceeds of 349 million net of 175 million of issuance costs from the sale of these shares and the warrants   cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2002 was 95 million compared to cash used in operating activities of 118 million in fiscal 2001 and cash provided by operating activities of 98 million in fiscal 2000 cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2002 resulted primarily from changes in operating assets and liabilities as adjusted for various noncash changes including restructuring charges provision for asset writedowns provision for doubtful accounts and depreciation and amortization cash used in operating activities in fiscal 2001 resulted primarily from operating losses partially offset by a decrease in net accounts receivable cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2000 resulted from increases in accounts receivable due to increased sales and other current assets which were partially offset by increases in accounts payable accrued liabilities and deferred revenues 17     cash used in investing activities was 127 million for the year ended september 30 2002 247 million for the year ended september 30 2001 and 437 million for the year ended september 30 2000 cash used in each of the fiscal years 2002 2001 and 2000 were due primarily to the purchase of investments and property and equipment partially offset by the sale of investments   cash provided by financing activities for the year ended september 30 2002 was 55 million as compared to cash provided by financing activities of 363 million in the prior year in 2002 our financing activities primarily related to cash received from the exercise of employee stock options and the purchase of common shares under our employee stock purchase plan in 2001 we also received 349 million related to the issuance of common stock to nokia in the third quarter of fiscal 2001   we expect that our existing cash balances and cash from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated working capital and capital

on two buildings for our corporate headquarters the lease commenced in july 2000 on the first building and the lease on the second building commenced in october 2000 the lease for both buildings

consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions   we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements   revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with the guidance provided under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 48 “revenue recognition when right of return exists” sec staff accounting bulleting sab no 101 “revenue recognition in financial statements” statement of position “sop” no 972 “software revenue recognition” and sop no 989 “modification of sop no 972 software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions”   we sell products through resellers original equipment manufacturers “oem” and other channel partners as well as directly to end users under similar terms we recognize product revenue upon shipment net of estimated returns provided that collection is determined to be probable and no significant obligations remain product revenues from oem agreements are recognized based on reporting of sales from the oem partner typically a software license hardware installation and postcontract customer support “pcs” elements are combined into a package with a single “bundled” price a portion of the sales price is allocated to each element of the bundled package based on their respective fair values as determined when the individual elements are sold separately revenues from the license of software are recognized when the software has been shipped and the customer is obligated to pay for the software when rights of return are present and we cannot estimate returns we recognize revenue when such rights lapse revenues for pcs are recognized on a 18   straightline basis over the service contract term pcs includes rights to upgrades when and if available a limited period of telephone support updates and bug fixes installation revenue is recognized when the product has been installed at the customer’s site consulting services are customarily billed at fixed rates plus outofpocket expenses and revenues are recognized when the consulting has been completed training revenue is recognized when the training has been completed 

  our ordinary payment terms to our domestic customers are net 30 days our ordinary payment terms to our international customers are net 30 to 90 days based on normal and customary trade practices in the individual markets we have offered extended payment terms beyond ordinary terms to some customers for these arrangements revenue is recognized when payments become due   reserve for doubtful accounts estimates are used in determining our allowance for bad debts and are based on our historical collection experience current trends credit policy specific identification and a percentage of our accounts receivable by aging category in determining these percentages we evaluate historical writeoffs of our receivables current trends in the credit quality of our customer base as well as changes in the credit policies we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition and generally do not require any collateral if there is a deterioration of a major customer’s credit worthiness or actual defaults are higher than our historical experience the recoverability of amounts due could be adversely affected   reserve for product returns sales returns are estimated based on historical experience by type of product and are recorded at the time revenues are recognized in some instances product revenue from distributors is subject to agreements allowing limited rights of return accordingly we reduce revenue recognized for estimated future returns at the time the related revenue is recorded when rights of return are present and we cannot estimate returns revenue is recognized when such rights lapse the estimates for returns are adjusted periodically based upon changes in historical rates of returns inventory in the distribution channel and other related factors it is possible that these estimates will change in the future or that the actual amounts could vary from our estimates and that the amounts of such changes could seriously harm our business   reserve for obsolete excess inventory we currently reduce the carrying value of inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management additional inventory writedowns may be required   reserve for warranties our warranty reserve is established based on our historical experience and best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date while we believe that our warranty reserve is adequate and that the judgment applied is appropriate such amounts estimated to be due and payable could differ materially from what will actually transpire in the future recent accounting pronouncements   in july 2001 the fasb issued sfas no 143 “accounting for asset retirement obligations” fasb 143 addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible longlived assets and the associated asset retirement costs it applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of longlived assets that result from acquisition construction or development and or the normal operation of a longlived asset except for certain obligations of lessees the adoption of this standard did not have an impact on our financial statements   in august 2001 the fasb issued sfas no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” this statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets this statement supersedes fasb statement no 121 accounting for the impairment of longlived assets and for longlived assets to be disposed of and the accounting and reporting provisions of apb opinion no 30 reporting the results of operations — reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business and extraordinary unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions for 19   the disposal of a segment of a business the adoption of this standard did not have an impact on our financial statements 

  in july 2002 the fasb issued sfas no 146 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities “sfas 146” sfas 146 requires that a liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized and measured initially at fair value only when the liability is incurred sfas 146 is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december 31 2002 we do not expect the adoption of sfas 146 to have a material impact on our financial statements risk factors   in addition to the other information in this report the following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating our company and its business our success depends on sales of our bigip®   we currently derive approximately 64 of our net revenues from sales of our bigip product line in addition we expect to derive a significant portion of our net revenues from sales of bigip in the future implementation of our strategy depends upon bigip being able to solve critical network availability and performance problems of our customers if bigip is unable to solve these problems for our customers our business and results of operations will be seriously harmed our success depends on our timely development of new products and features   we expect the internet traffic management market to be characterized by rapid technological change frequent new product introductions changes in customer requirements and evolving industry standards our continued success depends on our ability to identify and develop new products and new features for our existing products to meet the demands of these changes and for those products and features to be accepted by our existing and target customers if we are unable to identify develop and deploy new products and new product features on a timely basis or if those products do not gain market acceptance our business and results of operations may be seriously harmed we may not be able to compete effectively in the emerging internet traffic market   our markets are new rapidly evolving and highly competitive and we expect competition to persist and intensify in the future our principal competitors in the internet traffic market include cisco systems foundry networks nortel networks and radware we expect to continue to face additional competition as new participants enter the internet traffic management market in addition larger companies with significant resources brand recognition and sales channels may form alliances with or acquire competing internet traffic management solutions and emerge as significant competitors potential competitors may bundle their products or incorporate an internet traffic management component into existing products in a manner that discourages users from purchasing our products potential customers may also choose to purchase additional or larger servers instead of our products our quarterly operating results are volatile and may cause our stock price to fluctuate   our quarterly operating results have varied significantly in the past and will vary significantly in the future which makes it difficult for us to predict our future operating results in particular we anticipate that the size of customer orders may increase as we continue to focus on larger business accounts a delay in the recognition of revenue even from just one account may have a significant negative impact on our results of operations for a given period in the past a significant portion of our sales has been realized near the end of a quarter accordingly a delay in an anticipated sale past the end of a particular quarter may negatively impact our results of operations for that quarter furthermore we base our decisions regarding our operating expenses on anticipated revenue trends and our expense levels are relatively fixed consequently if revenue levels fall below our expectations our net income will decrease because only a small portion of our expenses vary with our revenues   we believe that periodtoperiod comparisons of our results of operations are not meaningful and should not be relied upon as indicators of future performance our operating results may be below the expectations of 20   securities analysts and investors in some future quarter or quarters our failure to meet these expectations will likely seriously harm the market price of our common stock 

the average selling price of our products may decrease and our costs may increase which may negatively impact gross profits   we anticipate that the average selling prices of our products will decrease in the future in response to competitive pricing pressures increased sales discounts new product introductions by us or our competitors or other factors therefore in order to maintain our gross profits we must develop and introduce new products and product enhancements on a timely basis and continually reduce our product costs our failure to do so will cause our net revenue and gross profits to decline which will seriously harm our business and results of operations in addition we may experience substantial periodtoperiod fluctuations in future operating results due to the erosion of our average selling prices it is difficult to predict our future operating results because we have an unpredictable sales cycle   our products have a lengthy sales cycle which is difficult to predict historically our sales cycle has ranged from approximately two to three months sales of bigip and 3dns require us to educate potential customers in their use and benefits the sale of our products is subject to delays from the lengthy internal budgeting approval and competitive evaluation processes that large corporations and governmental entities may require for example customers frequently begin by evaluating our products on a limited basis and devote time and resources to testing our products before they decide whether or not to purchase customers may also defer orders as a result of anticipated releases of new products or enhancements by our competitors or us as a result our products have an unpredictable sales cycle that contributes to the uncertainty of our future operating results we may not be able to sustain or develop new distribution relationships   our sales strategy requires that we establish and maintain multiple distribution channels in the united states and internationally through leading industry resellers original equipment manufacturers systems integrators internet service providers and other channel partners we have a limited number of agreements with companies in these channels and we may not be able to increase our number of distribution relationships or maintain our existing relationships during fiscal 2002 no single reseller or customer exceeded 10 of net revenue or our accounts receivable balance if we are unable to establish and maintain our indirect sales channels our business and results of operations will be seriously harmed our expansion into international markets may not succeed   we intend to continue expanding into international markets international sales represented 32 of our net revenues for the year ended september 30 2002 33 of our net revenues for the year ended september 30 2001 and 19 of our net revenues for the year ended september 30 2000 we have engaged sales personnel in australia europe and asia pacific our continued growth will require further expansion of our international operations in selected countries in the european and asia pacific markets if we are unable to expand our international operations successfully and in a timely manner our business and results of operations may be seriously harmed such expansion may be more difficult or take longer than we anticipate and we may not be able to successfully market sell deliver and support our products internationally our operating results are exposed to risks associated with international commerce   as our international sales increase our operating results become more exposed to international operating risks these risks include risks related to foreign currency exchange rates managing foreign sales offices regulatory political or economic conditions in specific countries changes in laws and tariffs inadequate protection of intellectual property rights in foreign countries foreign regulatory requirements and natural disasters all of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business 21   our success depends on our key personnel and our ability to attract train and retain qualified marketing and sales professional services and customer support personnel   our success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our key management product development sales marketing and finance personnel many of who may be difficult to replace the complexity of our internet traffic and content management products and their integration into existing networks and ongoing support as well as the sophistication of our sales and marketing effort requires us to retain highly trained professional services customer support and sales personnel in spite of the economic downturn competition for qualified professional services customer support and sales personnel in our industry is intense because of the limited number of people available with the necessary technical skills and understanding of our products our ability to retain and hire these personnel may be adversely affected by volatility or reductions in our stock price since these employees are generally granted stock options the loss of services of any of our key personnel the inability to retain and attract qualified personnel in the future or delays in hiring qualified personnel may seriously harm our business and results of operations our business may be harmed if our contract manufacturers are not able to provide us with adequate supplies of our products   we rely on third party contract manufacturers to assemble our products we outsource the manufacturing of our hardware platforms to a contract manufacturer who assembles these hardware platforms to our specifications we have experienced minor delays in shipments from our contract manufacturers in the past which have not had a material impact on our results of operations we may experience delays in the future or other problems such as inferior quality and insufficient quantity of product any of which may seriously harm our business and results of operations the inability of our contract manufacturer to provide us with adequate supplies of our products or the loss of our contract manufacturer may cause a delay in our ability to fulfill orders while we obtain a replacement manufacturer and may seriously harm our business and results of operations   if the demand for our products grows we will need to increase our material purchases contract manufacturing capacity and internal test and quality functions any disruptions in product flow may limit our revenue may seriously harm our competitive position and may result in additional costs or cancellation of orders by our customers our business could suffer if there are any interruptions or delays in the supply of hardware components from our thirdparty sources   we currently purchase several hardware components used in the assembly of our products from limited sources lead times for these components vary significantly any interruption or delay in the supply of any of these hardware components or the inability to procure a similar component from alternate sources at acceptable prices within a reasonable time will seriously harm our business and results of operations undetected software errors may seriously harm our business and results of operations   software products frequently contain undetected errors when first introduced or as new versions are released we have experienced these errors in the past in connection with new products and product upgrades we expect that these errors will be found from time to time in new or enhanced products after commencement of commercial shipments these problems may cause us to incur significant warranty and repair costs divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts and cause significant customer relations problems we may also be subject to liability claims for damages related to product errors while we carry insurance policies covering this type of liability these policies may not provide sufficient protection should a claim be asserted a material product liability claim may seriously harm our business and results of operations   our products must successfully operate with products from other vendors as a result when problems occur in a network it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem the occurrence of software errors whether caused by our products or another vendor’s products may result in the delay or loss of market acceptance of our products the occurrence of any of these problems may seriously harm our business and results of operations 22   we may not adequately protect our intellectual property and our products may infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties   we rely on a combination of patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure of confidential and proprietary information to protect our intellectual property rights despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology monitoring unauthorized use of our products is difficult and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of our technology particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states   from time to time third parties may assert exclusive patent copyright trademark and other intellectual property rights claims or initiate litigation against us or our contract manufacturers suppliers or customers with respect to existing or future products our license agreements typically require us to indemnify our customers for infringement actions related to our technology which could cause us to become involved in infringement claims made against our customers we may in the future initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights to determine the scope and validity of our proprietary rights or those of our competitors any of these claims with or without merit may be timeconsuming result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel or require us to cease using infringing technology develop noninfringing technology or enter into royalty or licensing agreements such royalty or licensing agreements if required may not be available on acceptable terms if at all in the event of a successful claim of infringement and our failure or inability to develop noninfringing technology or license the infringed or similar technology on a timely basis our business and results of operations may be seriously harmed

report of compensation committee

          the information contained in this report shall not be deemed to be
soliciting material or to be filed with the securities and exchange
commission nor shall such information be incorporated by reference into any
future filings under the securities act of 1933 as amended or the 1934
securities exchange act as amended except to the extent that the company
specifically incorporates it by reference in such filing

          the compensation committee is comprised of three members of the board
of directors who are not employees of the company it is responsible for setting
and monitoring policies governing compensation of executive officers the
compensation committee reviews the performance and compensation levels for
executive officers and sets salary and bonus levels and option grants under the
companys stock option plans the objectives of the committee are to correlate
executive compensation with our business objectives and performance and to
enable the company to attract retain and reward executive officers who
contribute to its longterm success

    salary

          the compensation committee annually assesses the performance and sets
the salary of the president and chief executive officer this position was held
by jeffrey s hussey until july 2000 and by john mcadam since that time in
turn the president and chief executive officer annually assesses the
performance of all other executive officers and recommends salary increases
which are reviewed and approved by the compensation committee

          in particular mr mcadams compensation as president and chief
executive officer is based on compensation levels of presidentchief executive
officers of comparable size technology companies a portion of mr mcadams
compensation consists of incentive compensation that is based on the companys
financial performance

          in determining executive officer salaries the compensation committee
reviews recommendations from mr mcadam which include information from salary
surveys covering technology companies in the seattle and other comparable areas
individual performance levels and the companys financial condition the
compensation committee also considers incentive compensation based on the
companys financial performance

          bonuses for mr mcadam and the other executive officers are paid on a
quarterly basis according to a formula based on actual financial results

    stock options

          the compensation committee believes that employee equity ownership
provides significant motivation to executive officers to maximize value for the
companys shareholders and therefore periodically grants stock options under
our employee stock option plans stock options are typically granted at the
current market price and will only have value if the companys stock price
increases over the exercise price

          the compensation committee determines the size and frequency of option
grants for executive officers based on recommendations from the chief executive
officer recommendations for options are based on the relative position and
responsibilities of each executive officer previous and expected contributions
of each officer to the companys success and previous options grants to such
executive officers generally option grants vest over a fouryear period
several belowmarket grants have been given to certain executive officers that
vest over a two year period

          under the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1993 the federal
income tax deduction for certain types of compensation paid to the chief
executive officer and four other most highly compensated executive officers of
publicly held companies is limited to 1 million per officer per fiscal year
unless such compensation meets certain requirements the compensation committee
is aware of this limitation and had decided that it is not appropriate at this
time to limit the companys discretion to design the cash compensation packages
payable to the companys executive officers
