 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the normal risks of business we are subject to significant risks and uncertainties including those listed below and others described elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k any of the risks described herein could result in a significant adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

risks related to our business and operations 

the extent to which the covid19 pandemic and measures taken in response thereto impact our business results of operations liquidity and financial condition will depend on the effectiveness of vaccines and other medical developments to further decrease the spread of covid19 and its impact on global and local economies 

global health concerns relating to covid19 and related government actions taken to reduce the spread of the virus have continued to weigh on the macroeconomic environment but the impact of covid19 on global and local economies has been reduced in areas where such governmental actions including the distribution of vaccines have been more widespread economic activity increased in many areas throughout 2021 including most notably an increase in consumer and business spending by digital methods compared to 2020 when the impact of covid19 first arose in the fourth quarter of 2021 some governmental restrictions were reimposed based upon a resurgence of covid19 in many areas of the us and europe which resulted in an adverse impact on payment volumes and transactions compared to those anticipated following the easing of restrictions in the prior two quarters in addition we have continued to see adverse impacts on spending in discretionary spending verticals including travel airlines and restaurants these changes in spending affected our business results of operations and financial condition throughout 2021 and will likely continue to have such an impact in 2022 although the magnitude and duration of their ultimate effect is not possible to predict the distribution of vaccines against covid19 curtailed the impact of the pandemic in 2021 in many of the larger countries in which we do business but the timing of a complete recovery remains uncertain as new variants of covid19 continue to evolve and spread  

we may experience additional pandemicrelated financial impacts due to a number of operational factors including 

• increased risk of merchant and card issuer failures and credit settlement and chargeback risk 

• increased risk of meeting client service contractual obligations due to government lockdown or other orders where it is not possible to provide certain clientfacing services from home or to promptly transfer them to other locations causing potential loss of revenue or contractual penalties due to failure to meet service level requirements as well as potential legal disputes and associated costs regarding force majeure or other related contract defenses 

• increased cyber and payment fraud risk related to covid19 as cybercriminals attempt to profit from the disruption given increased online banking ecommerce and other online activity 

• challenges to the availability and reliability of our solutions and services due to changes to normal operations including the possibility of one or more clusters of covid19 cases occurring at our data centers contact centers or operations centers affecting our employees or affecting the systems or employees of our clients or other third parties on which we depend 

• an increased volume of unanticipated client and regulatory requests for information and support or additional regulatory requirements which could require additional resources and costs to address including for example government initiatives to reduce or eliminate payments costs or fees to merchants 

• continued incremental costs directly related to covid19 although their magnitude is uncertain and 

• the general impact of recession and instability of markets across the globe 

additional uncertainty is added in the us by conflicting federal and state laws regulations and executive orders regarding whether vaccinations for covid19 may be required in the workplace until challenges to these laws are finally decided by the courts there is uncertainty as to what businesses may require for employees to return to the workplace we have modified our business practices to allow for more hybrid schedules as to when employees need to be in the office in an attempt to meet the changes in the workplace in todays world as well as allowing continued work from home at least temporarily where appropriate to accommodate others not taking the vaccine in order to provide a safe workplace there is no certainty that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate all of the risks posed by the virus or will otherwise be satisfactory to government authorities further the ability of our senior management and employees to get to work has been disrupted across multiple locations whether in their own offices or at client sites due among other things to government work and travel restrictions including mandatory shutdowns 

in addition  we have extended at times during the pandemic higherthanusual levels of credit to our merchant clients as part of funds settlement in connection with payments to their customers for among other things refunds for cancelled trips and events if the speed of repayments to us by our merchant clients is substantially slower than expected over an extended period 

of time or if our merchant clients cease operations such that we are unable to collect on the credit advanced by us for these payments or for any chargeback liability it could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity results of operations and financial condition 

the extent to which covid19 impacts our business results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments which remain uncertain and are difficult to predict including but not limited to the duration and spread of the pandemic and its variants its severity the actions to contain the virus or treat its impact and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume we may experience materially adverse impacts to our business as a result of the pandemics global economic impact including the availability of credit and our ability to comply with the covenants of our credit agreement adverse impacts on our liquidity our ability to meet our deleveraging targets and any recession that has occurred or may occur in the future such impacts may also have a material effect on one or more of the estimates and assumptions used to evaluate goodwill impairment and could result in future goodwill impairment 

there are no comparable recent events that provide guidance as to the effect the spread and duration of covid19 as a global pandemic may have and as a result the ultimate impact of the pandemic is highly uncertain and subject to change we do not yet know the full extent of the impacts on our business our operations or the global economy as a whole however the impacts of the pandemic could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations liquidity or financial condition and heighten many of our known risks described in the remainder of this  risk factors section  

security breaches or attacks or our failure to comply with information security laws or regulations or industry security requirements could harm our business by disrupting delivery of services and damaging the reputation of fis and could result in a breach of one or more client contracts 

fis electronically receives processes stores and transmits sensitive business information of its clients in addition fis collects personal consumer data such as names and addresses social security numbers drivers license numbers cardholder data and payment history records such information is necessary to support our clients transaction processing and to conduct our check authorization and collection businesses the uninterrupted operation of information systems as well as the confidentiality of the customerconsumer information that resides on such systems is critical to the successful operation of fis for that reason cybersecurity is one of the principal operational risks fis faces as a provider of services to financial institutions if fis fails to maintain an adequate security infrastructure adapt to emerging security threats or implement sufficient security standards and technology to protect against security breaches the confidentiality of the information fis secures could be compromised unauthorized access to the computer systems or databases of fis could result in the theft or publication of confidential information the deletion or modification of records damages from legal actions from clients andor their customers or otherwise cause interruptions in fis operations and damage to its reputation these risks are greater with increased information transmission over the internet the increasing level of sophistication posed by cyber criminals nation statesponsored cyber attacks and the integration of fis systems with those of acquired companies 

as a provider of services to financial institutions and a provider of card processing services fis is bound by the same limitations on disclosure of the information fis receives from clients as apply to the clients themselves if fis fails to comply with these regulations and industry security requirements it could be exposed to damages from legal actions from clients andor their customers governmental proceedings governmental notice requirements and the imposition of significant fines or prohibitions on card processing services in addition if more restrictive privacy laws rules or industry security requirements are adopted in the future on the federal or state level or by a specific industry body they could have an adverse impact on fis through increased costs or restrictions on business processes 

any inability to prevent security or privacy breaches or the perception that such breaches may occur could cause existing clients to lose confidence in fis systems and terminate their agreements with fis inhibit fis ability to attract new clients result in increasing regulation or bring about other adverse consequences from the government agencies that regulate fis 

entity mergers or consolidations and business failures in the banking and financial services industry could adversely affect our business by eliminating some of our existing and potential clients and making us more dependent on a more limited number of clients 

there has been and continues to be substantial consolidation activity in the banking and financial services industry in addition certain financial institutions that experienced negative operating results including some of our clients have failed these consolidations and failures reduce our number of potential clients and may reduce our number of existing clients which could adversely affect our revenue even if the events do not reduce the aggregate activities of the consolidated entities further if our clients or our partners across any of our businesses fail andor merge with or are acquired by other entities that are not our clients or our partners or that use fewer of our services they may discontinue or reduce use of our services it is also possible 

that larger financial institutions resulting from consolidations would have greater leverage in negotiating terms or could decide to perform inhouse some or all of the services we currently provide or could provide any of these developments could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

if we fail to innovate or adapt our services to changes in technology or in the marketplace or if our ongoing efforts to upgrade or implement our technology are not successful we could lose clients or our clients could lose customers and we could have difficulty attracting new clients for our services 

the markets for our services are characterized by constant technological changes frequent introductions of new services and evolving industry standards our future success will be significantly affected by our ability to enhance our current solutions and develop and introduce new solutions and services that address the increasingly sophisticated needs of our clients and their customers in addition as more of our revenue and market demand shifts to software as a service saas business process as a service bpaas cloud and new emerging technologies the need to keep pace with rapid technology changes becomes more acute these initiatives carry the risks associated with any new solution development effort including cost overruns delays in delivery and implementation and performance issues there can be no assurance that we will be successful in developing marketing and selling new solutions or enhancements that meet these changing demands any of these developments could have an adverse impact on our future revenue andor business prospects 

we operate in a competitive business environment if we are unable to compete effectively our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 

the market for our services is intensely competitive our competitors in banking and capital markets vary in size and in the scope and breadth of the solutions and services they offer some of our competitors have substantial resources we face direct competition from third parties and because many of our larger potential clients have historically developed their key applications inhouse and therefore view their system requirements from a makeversusbuy perspective we also often compete against our potential clients inhouse capacities in addition the markets in which we compete have recently attracted increasing competition from smaller startups with emerging technologies which are receiving increasing investments global banks and businesses controlled by combinations of global banks and global internet companies that are introducing competitive solutions and services into the marketplace particularly in the payments area emerging technologies and increased competition may also have the effect of unbundling bank solutions and result in displacing solutions we are currently providing from our legacy systems international competitors are also now targeting and entering the us market with greater force there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors or that the competitive pressures we face in the markets in which we operate will not materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

in the merchant business our competitors include financial institutions and wellestablished payment processing companies in this business our us competitors that are financial institutions or are affiliated with financial institutions may not incur the sponsorship costs we incur for registration with the payment networks accordingly these competitors may be able to offer more attractive fees to our current and prospective clients or other services that we do not provide competition could result in a loss of existing clients and greater difficulty attracting new clients furthermore if competition causes us to reduce the fees we charge in order to attract or retain clients there is no assurance we can successfully control our costs in order to maintain our profit margins one or more of these factors could have a material adverse effect on fis business financial condition and results of operations 

as the merchant industry fragments into new nontraditional payment and asset types siloed expertise new geographies and different markets our competitors in this segment are increasing in number fis is currently facing new competitive pressure from nontraditional payment processors and other parties entering the payments industry which may compete in one or more of these areas these competitors have significant financial resources and robust networks and are highly regarded by consumers if these competitors gain a greater share of total electronic payments transactions or if we are unable to successfully react to changes in the industry spurred by the entry of these new market participants then it could have a material adverse effect on fis business financial condition and results of operations see item 1 business  competition 

global economic political and other conditions including business cycles and consumer confidence may adversely affect our clients or trends in consumer spending which may adversely impact the demand for our services and our revenue and profitability 

a significant portion of our revenue is derived from transaction processing fees the global transaction processing industries depend heavily upon the overall level of consumer business and government spending any change in economic 

factors including a sustained deterioration in general economic conditions or consumer confidence particularly in the us or inflation and increases in interest rates in key countries in which we operate may adversely affect consumer spending consumer debt levels and credit and debit card usage and as a result adversely affect our financial performance by reducing the number or average purchase amount of transactions that we service supply chain issues globally including those caused by the covid19 pandemic can slow down the provision of parts for our products such as chips in emv cards and could adversely impact revenue 

when there is a slowdown or downturn in the economy a drop in stock market levels or trading volumes or an event that disrupts the financial markets our business and financial results particularly with respect to our capital markets segment may suffer for a number of reasons customers may react to worsening conditions by reducing their capital expenditures in general or by specifically reducing their information technology spending in addition customers may curtail or discontinue trading operations delay or cancel information technology projects or seek to lower their costs by renegotiating vendor contracts moreover competitors may respond to market conditions by lowering prices and attempting to lure away our customers to lower cost solutions any further protective trade policies or actions taken by the us may also result in other countries reducing or making more expensive services permitted to be provided by usbased companies if any of these circumstances remain in effect for an extended period of time there could be a material adverse effect on our financial results 

our results may fluctuate from period to period because of the lengthy and unpredictable sales cycle for our software changes in our mix of licenses and services activity by competitors and customer budgeting operational requirements or renewal cycles 

particularly with respect to our capital markets segment our operating results may fluctuate from period to period and be difficult to predict in a particular period due to the timing and magnitude of software license sales and other factors we offer a decreasing number of our software solutions on a license basis which means that the customer has the right to run the software on its own or a third partys hardware we generally recognize license revenue when the license contract is signed the software is delivered and the term has begun the value of the license often depends on a number of customerspecific factors such as the number of customer locations users or accounts the sales cycle for a software license may be lengthy and take unexpected turns thus it is difficult to predict when software sales will occur or how much revenue they will generate because there are few incremental costs associated with software sales our operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year due to the timing and magnitude of software sales conversion of clients from licenses to bpaas solutions while resulting in longerterm contracts may result in uneven shortterm results as onetime license fees are replaced by recurring revenue our results may also vary as a result of pricing pressures increased cost of equipment the evolving and unpredictable markets in which our solutions and services are sold changes in accounting principles and competitors new solutions or services 

failure to obtain new clients or renew client contracts on favorable terms could adversely affect results of operations and financial condition 

we may face pricing pressure in obtaining and retaining our clients larger clients in particular may use their negotiating leverage to seek price reductions from us when they renew a contract when a contract is extended or when the clients business has significant volume changes larger clients may also reduce services if they decide to move services inhouse further our smaller and midsize clients may also exert pricing pressure particularly upon renewal due to competition or other economic needs or pressures being experienced by the client on some occasions this pricing pressure results in lower revenue from a client than we had anticipated based on our previous agreement with that client this reduction in revenue could adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

our business and operating results could be adversely affected if we experience business interruptions errors or failure in connection with our or thirdparty information technology and communication systems and other software and hardware used in connection with our business if we experience defects or design errors in the software solutions we offer or more generally if the thirdparty vendors we rely upon are unwilling or unable to provide the services we need to effectively operate our business 

many of our services are based on sophisticated software and computing systems and we may encounter delays when developing new technology solutions and services further the technology solutions underlying our services have occasionally contained and may in the future contain undetected errors or defects when first introduced or when new versions are released in addition we may experience difficulties in installing or integrating our technologies on platforms used by our clients or our clients may cancel a project after we have expended significant effort and resources to complete an installation finally our systems and operations could be exposed to damage or interruption from fire floods hurricanes earthquakes tornadoes typhoons drought highwinds severe weather events other natural disasters power loss telecommunications failure 

unauthorized entry and computer viruses defects in our technology solutions errors or delays in the processing of electronic transactions or other difficulties could result in i interruption of business operations ii delay in market acceptance iii additional development and remediation costs iv diversion of technical and other resources v loss of clients vi negative publicity or vii exposure to liability claims any one or more of the foregoing could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations although we attempt to limit our potential liability through controls including system redundancies security controls application development and testing controls and disclaimers and limitationofliability provisions in our license and client agreements we cannot be certain that these measures will always be successful in preventing disruption or limiting our liability 

further most of the solutions we offer are very complex software systems that are regularly updated no matter how careful the design and development complex software often contains errors and defects when first introduced and when major new updates or enhancements are released if errors or defects are discovered in current or future solutions then we may not be able to correct them in a timely manner if at all in our development of updates and enhancements to our software solutions we may make a major design error that makes the solution operate incorrectly or less efficiently the failure of software to properly perform could result in the company and its clients being subjected to losses or liability including censures fines or other sanctions by the applicable regulatory authorities and we could be liable to parties who are financially harmed by those errors in addition such errors could cause the company to lose revenue lose clients or damage its reputation 

in addition we generally depend on a number of third parties both in the united states and internationally to supply elements of our systems computers research and market data connectivity communication network infrastructure other equipment and related support and maintenance we cannot be certain that any of these third parties will be able to continue providing these services to effectively meet our evolving needs if our vendors or in certain cases vendors of our customers fail to meet their obligations provide poor or untimely service or we are unable to make alternative arrangements for the provision of these services then we may in turn fail to provide our services or to meet our obligations to our customers and our business financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected 

the company is subject to regulation supervision and enforcement authority of numerous governmental and regulatory bodies in the jurisdictions in which it operates 

because the company is a technology service provider to us financial institutions it is subject to regular oversight and examination by the fba each of which is a member of the ffiec an interagency body of federal banking regulators the fba have broad discretion in the implementation interpretation and enforcement of banking and consumer protection laws and use the ffiecs uniform principles standards and report forms in their review of bank service providers like fis a failure to comply with these laws or a failure to meet the supervisory expectations of the banking regulators could result in adverse action against the company the regulators have the power to among other things enjoin unsafe or unsound practices require affirmative actions to correct any violation or practice issue administrative orders that can be judicially enforced direct the sale of subsidiaries or other assets and assess civil money penalties 

the company is also subject to ongoing supervision by regulatory and governmental bodies across the world including economic and conduct regulators such as the fca and psr in the uk the dnb in the netherlands and regulatory and governmental bodies responsible for issuing antimoney laundering antibribery and global economic sanctions regulations these various regulatory regimes require compliance across many aspects of our merchant activities in respect of capital requirements safeguarding training authorization and supervision of personnel systems processes and documentation as we continue to grow our global ecommerce business around the world we will become subject to additional countries regulations governing merchant acquiring and related payments matters 

we also have business operations that store process or transmit consumer information or have direct relationships with consumers that are obligated to comply with regulations including but not limited to the fcra the federal fair debt collection practices act and applicable privacy requirements in addition our wealth and retirement business holds a charter in the state of georgia which exposes us to further regulatory compliance requirements of the georgia department of banking and finance the us wealth and retirement business is required to hold certain levels of regulatory capital as defined by the state banking regulator in georgia in the uk our merchant business as well as our platform securities and brokerdealer businesses are regulated by the fca and are also subject to further regulatory capital requirements 

the consumer financial protection bureau cfpb continues to establish rules and regulations for regulating financial and nonfinancial institutions and providers to those institutions to ensure adequate protection of consumer privacy and to ensure consumers are not impacted by deceptive business practices as well as provide examination and supervisory authority over consumer reporting agencies including chexsystems these rules and regulations govern our clients or potential clients 

and also govern certain of our businesses these regulations have resulted and may further result in the need for fis to make capital investments to modify our solutions and services to facilitate our clients and potential clients compliance as well as to deploy additional processes or reporting to comply with these regulations the biden administration has projected that it may expand the reach of this agency in the future we may be subject to additional expense to ensure continued compliance with applicable laws and regulations and to investigate defend andor remedy actual or alleged violations further requirements of these regulations have resulted and could further result in changes in our business practices our clients business practices and those of other marketplace participants that may alter the delivery of services to consumers which have impacted and could further impact the demand for our software and services as well as alter the types or volume of transactions that we process on behalf of our clients as a result these requirements or proposed or future requirements could have an adverse impact on our financial condition revenue results of operations prospects for future growth and overall business 

the new york department of financial services has enacted rules that require covered financial institutions to establish and maintain cybersecurity programs these rules subject fis to additional regulation and require us to adopt additional business practices that could also require additional capital expenditures or impact our operating results changes to state money transmission laws and regulations including changing interpretations and the implementation of new or varying regulatory requirements may result in the need for additional money transmitter licenses these changes could result in increased costs of compliance as well as fines or penalties 

one of our subsidiaries is an sec registered brokerdealer in the us and is subject to the financial and operational rules of finra and others are authorized by the fca to conduct certain regulated business in the uk our transfer agent business is also regulated by the sec and other regulators around the world domestic and foreign regulatory and selfregulatory organizations such as the sec finra and the fca can among other things fine censure issue ceaseanddesist orders against and suspend or expel a brokerdealer or its officers or employees for failure to comply with the many laws and regulations that govern brokerage activities regulations affecting the brokerage industry may change which could adversely affect our financial results 

we are exposed to certain risks relating to the execution services provided by our brokerage operations to our customers and counterparties which include other brokerdealers active traders hedge funds asset managers and other institutional and noninstitutional clients these risks include but are not limited to customers or counterparties failing to pay for or deliver securities trading errors the inability or failure to settle trades and trade execution system failures as trading in the us securities markets has become more automated the potential impact of a trading error or a rapid series of errors caused by a computer or human error or a malicious act has become greater in our other businesses we generally can disclaim liability for trading losses that may be caused by our software but in our brokerage operations we may not be able to limit our liability for trading losses or failed trades even when we are not at fault as a result we may suffer losses that are disproportionately large compared to the relatively modest profit contributions of our brokerage operations 

moreover the legislative and regulatory landscape continues to evolve and we expect that it may cover alternative payment types including cryptocurrency any failure to comply with such laws could expose us to liability andor reputational damage financial crimes laws may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to country and impose inconsistent or conflicting requirements complying with varying jurisdictional requirements could increase the costs and complexity of compliance and associated recordkeeping costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business 

if we fail to comply with relevant regulations then we risk reputational damage potential civil and criminal sanctions fines or other action imposed by regulatory or governmental authorities including the potential suspension or revocation of the permissionbased regulatory licenses which authorize the company to provide core services to customers we are also involved from time to time in regulatory investigations reviews and proceedings both formal and informal by regulatory authorities regarding our businesses certain of which may result in adverse settlements fines penalties injunctions or other relief this could result in an adverse effect on fis business reputation and customer relationships which in turn could adversely affect its financial position and performance 

many of our clients are subject to a regulatory environment and to industry standards that may change in a manner that reduces the types or volume of solutions or services we provide or may reduce the type or number of transactions in which our clients engage and therefore reduce our revenue 

our clients are subject to a number of government regulations and industry standards with which our services must comply our clients must ensure that our services and related solutions work within the extensive and evolving regulatory and industry requirements applicable to them federal state foreign or industry authorities could adopt laws rules or regulations affecting 

our clients businesses that could lead to increased operating costs and could reduce the convenience and functionality of our services possibly resulting in reduced market acceptance in addition action by regulatory authorities relating to credit availability data usage privacy or other related regulatory developments could have an adverse effect on our clients and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition revenue results of operations prospects for future growth and overall business elimination of regulatory requirements could also adversely affect the sales of our solutions designed to help clients comply with complex regulatory environments 

our revenue relating to all aspects of the sale of services to members of visa mastercard and other payment networks is dependent upon our continued certification and sponsorship and the loss or suspension of certification or sponsorship could adversely affect our business 

in order to provide our card processing services we must be certified including applicable sponsorship by visa mastercard american express discover and other similar organizations these certifications are dependent upon our continued adherence to the standards of the issuing bodies and sponsoring member banks the member financial institutions some of which are our competitors set the standards with which we must comply if we fail to comply with these standards we could be fined our certifications could be suspended or our registration could be terminated the suspension or termination of our certifications or any changes in or the enforcement of the rules and regulations governing or relating to the businesses of visa mastercard or other payment networks could result in a reduction in revenue or increased costs of operation for us which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business 

in order to provide merchant transaction processing services in the us and certain other jurisdictions we are registered through our bank sponsorships with the visa mastercard and other payment networks as service providers for member institutions as a result fis and many of its clients are subject to payment network rules if fis or its associated participants do not comply with the payment network requirements the payment networks could seek to fine fis suspend fis or terminate its registrations our merchant business has occasionally received notices of noncompliance and fines which have typically related to excessive chargebacks by a merchant or data security failures on the part of a merchant if fis is unable to recover fines from or pass through costs to its merchants or other associated participants then fis would experience a financial loss the termination of its registration or any changes in the payment network rules that would impair fis registrations could require the company to stop providing payment network services to the visa mastercard or other payment networks which would have a material adverse effect on fis business financial condition and results of operations 

outside of the us our merchant business primarily provides acquiring and processing services directly through international credit and debit card networks run by visa mastercard and other payment networks in order to access the card networks the company must maintain the relevant jurisdictional operating licenses or memberships in some markets where it is not feasible or possible for the company to have a direct acquiring license with a card network we have a relationship with a local financial institution sponsor as part of the companys registration with card networks either directly or indirectly through local sponsors the company is subject to operating rules including mandatory technology requirements promulgated by the card networks that could subject the company and its customers to a variety of fines and penalties as well as suspension and termination of membership or access 

these agreements in the us and elsewhere with bank sponsors give such sponsors substantial discretion in approving certain aspects of our business practices in our merchant business including our solicitation application and qualification procedures for merchants and the terms of our agreements with merchants our financial institution sponsors discretionary actions under these agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we also rely on various financial institutions to provide clearing services in connection with our settlement activities without these sponsorships or clearing services agreements in our merchant business we would not be able to process visa mastercard and other payment network transactions or settle transactions in relevant markets including the us which would have a material adverse effect on fis business financial condition and results of operations furthermore fis financial results could be adversely affected if the costs associated with such sponsorships or clearing services agreements increase 

changes in the contracts rules or standards of networks or relevant legal or regulatory scrutiny of pricing practices could adversely affect fis business financial condition and results of operations 

from time to time card and debit networks increase the interchange fees that they charge at their sole discretion our financial institution sponsors have the right to pass any increases in interchange and other fees on to us and they have consistently done so in the past while we are generally permitted under the contracts with our merchants to pass these fee increases along to our merchants through corresponding increases in our processing fees if we cannot continue to do so due to 

contractual or regulatory requirements or competitive pressures the inability to pass through such fees could have a material adverse effect on fis business financial condition and results of operations additionally in order to access the card networks directly as our merchant business does primarily outside the us we must pay card network membership fees which are subject to change from time to time and which we may be unable to pass along to our merchant clients potentially resulting in fis absorbing a portion or all of such increases in the future 

furthermore the rules and regulations of the various card associations and networks prescribe certain capital requirements any increase in the capital level required would further limit our use of capital for other purposes moreover as payment networks become more dependent on proprietary technology modify their technological approach or operating practices andor seek to provide value added services to issuers and merchants there is heightened risk that rules and standards may be governed by their own selfinterest or the selfinterest of third parties with influence over them which could materially impact fis competitive position and operations 

interchange fees and pricing practices have been receiving significant legal and regulatory scrutiny worldwide the resulting changes that could occur from proposed regulations or other forms of enforcement could alter the fees charged by us card associations and debit networks worldwide such changes could have an adverse impact on our business or financial condition and results of operations 

privacy laws and regulations have required and will further require fis to adopt new business practices and contractual provisions in existing and new contracts which may require transitional and incremental expenses which may impact our future operating results 

privacy laws such as the gdpr in the eu continue to develop in unpredictable ways the company is also subject to the california consumer privacy act and laws in various other states the brazilian general personal data protection act and new privacy laws in india and the asia pacific region failure to comply with these new laws could result in significant penalties damage to our brand and loss of business the company has incurred and will continue to incur costs to comply with these new laws there are also several additional privacy laws being considered by state legislatures the federal legislature and countries around the world as a result a more substantial compliance effort with varying regimes in different jurisdictions is considered probable in the future which will increase the costs and complexities of the business moreover privacy laws may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to country and impose inconsistent or conflicting requirements complying with varying jurisdictional requirements could increase the costs and complexity of compliance and associated recordkeeping costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business and incur additional costs data localization requirements in evolving data protection laws could also increase the cost and alter the approach to housing data around the world in addition our businesses are increasingly subject to laws and regulations relating to surveillance encryption and data onshoring in the jurisdictions in which we operate compliance with these laws and regulations may require us to change our technology for information security operational infrastructure policies and procedures which could be timeconsuming and costly 

high profile payment card industry or digital banking security breaches could impact consumer payment behavior patterns in the future and reduce our card payment transaction volumes 

we are unable to predict whether or when high profile card payment or digital banking security breaches will occur and if they occur whether consumers will transact less on their payment cards or reduce their digital banking service if consumers transact less on cards issued by our clients or reduce digital banking services and we are not able to adapt to offer our clients alternative technologies then our revenue and related earnings could be adversely affected 

misappropriation of our intellectual property and proprietary rights or a finding that our patents are invalid could impair our competitive position 

our ability to compete depends in some part upon our proprietary solutions and technology despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our services or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary or challenge the validity of our patents with governmental authorities policing unauthorized use of our proprietary rights is difficult we cannot make any assurances that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of technology or that the agreements entered into for that purpose will be enforceable effective patent trademark service mark copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our applications and services are made available online misappropriation of our intellectual property or potential litigation concerning such matters could have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition as we increase our international business we are subject to 

further risks of misappropriation of our intellectual property risks in countries which have laws which are less protective of intellectual property or are enforced in a less protective manner 

if our applications or services are found to infringe the proprietary rights of others then we may be required to change our business practices and may also become subject to significant costs and monetary penalties 

as our information technology applications and services develop we are increasingly subject to infringement claims any claims whether with or without merit could i be expensive and timeconsuming to defend ii result in an injunction or other equitable relief which could cause us to cease making licensing or using applications that incorporate the challenged intellectual property iii require us to redesign our applications if feasible iv divert managements attention and resources and v require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements in order to obtain the right to use necessary technologies or pay damages resulting from any infringing use 

some of our solutions contain open source software and any failure to comply with the terms of one or more of these open source licenses could adversely affect our business 

we use a limited amount of software licensed by its authors or other third parties under socalled open source licenses and may continue to use such software in the future some of these licenses contain requirements that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the open source software and that we license such modifications or derivative works under the terms of a particular open source license or other license granting third parties certain rights of further use by the terms of certain open source licenses we could be required to release the source code of our proprietary software if we combine our proprietary software with open source software in a certain manner additionally the terms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by us or other courts and there is a risk that these licenses could be construed in a manner that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our solutions in addition to risks related to license requirements usage of open source software can lead to greater risks than use of thirdparty commercial software as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on origin of the software we have established processes to help alleviate these risks including a review process for screening requests from our development organizations for the use of open source but we cannot be sure that all open source is submitted for approval prior to use in our solutions in addition many of the risks associated with usage of open source cannot be eliminated and could if not properly addressed adversely affect our business 

lack of system integrity fraudulent payments credit quality and undetected errors related to funds settlement or the availability of clearing services could result in a financial loss 

we settle funds on behalf of financial institutions other businesses and consumers and receive funds from clients card issuers payment networks and consumers on a daily basis for a variety of transaction types transactions facilitated by us include debit card credit card electronic bill payment transactions banking payments and check clearing that supports consumers financial institutions and other businesses these payment activities rely upon the technology infrastructure that facilitates the verification of activity with counterparties the facilitation of the payment as well as the detection or prevention of fraudulent payments if our continuity of operations integrity of processing or ability to detect or prevent fraudulent payments were compromised this could result in a financial loss to us in addition we rely on various financial institutions to provide automated clearing house ach services in support of funds settlement for certain of our solutions if we are unable to obtain such ach services in the future that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations in addition we may issue credit to consumers financial institutions or other businesses as part of the funds settlement a default on this credit by a counterparty could result in a financial loss to us furthermore if one of our clients for which we facilitate settlement suffers a fraudulent event due to a deficiency in their controls we may suffer a financial loss if the client does not have sufficient capital to cover the loss 

fraud by merchants or others could have a material adverse effect on fis business financial condition and results of operations 

in our merchant business we face potential liability for fraudulent electronic payment transactions initiated by merchants third parties or other associated participants examples of merchant fraud include when a merchant or other party knowingly accepts payment by a stolen or counterfeit credit debit or prepaid card card number or other credentials records a false sales transaction utilizing a stolen or counterfeit card or credentials processes an invalid card or intentionally fails to deliver the merchandise or services sold in an otherwise valid transaction in the event a dispute between a cardholder and a merchant is not resolved in favor of the merchant the transaction is normally charged back to the merchant and the purchase price is credited or otherwise refunded to the cardholder and fis is required to collect from the merchant failure to effectively manage 

risk and prevent fraud or other criminal activity could increase fis chargebacks or other liability increases in chargebacks or other liabilities due to merchant failures or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on fis business financial condition and results of operations 

the uks exit from membership in the eu could cause disruption to and create uncertainty surrounding our business 

our merchant business has a significant amount of business in and services clients in the uk we also have other business and operations in the uk and the eu the uk left the eu brexit on january 31 2020 pursuant to the terms of a withdrawal agreement concluded between the uk government and the council of the eu the withdrawal agreement included a transition period until december 31 2020 during which time the uk followed the eus rules and regulations and remained in the single market and customs union while the future terms of the uk’s relationship with the eu were being negotiated that transition period has now ended on december 24 2020 the uk and the eu announced they had struck a new bilateral trade and cooperation deal governing the future relationship between the uk and the eu the trade and cooperation agreement which sets out the principles of the relationship between the eu and the uk following the end of the transition period the trade and cooperation agreement was initially applied on a provisional basis and subsequently entered into force on may 1 2021 however the trade and cooperation agreement is only part of the overall package of agreements reached other supplementing agreements include a series of joint declarations on a range of important issues where further cooperation is foreseen including a memorandum of understanding mou establishing a framework for regulatory cooperation in financial services the mou states that the eu and the uk will discuss how to move forward with equivalence determinations in relation to financial services the application of the mou and its effect on our business and the regulatory regime in which we operate is uncertain it should be noted that even if equivalence arrangements for certain sectors of the financial services industry are agreed market access is unlikely to be as comprehensive as the market access that the uk experienced through its eu membership 

as a result there remains unavoidable uncertainties related to brexit and although the potential impact of brexit on our business cannot be fully assessed until the new relationship between the uk and eu is developed and defined and the uk negotiates concludes and implements successor trading arrangements with other countries brexit is likely to result in ongoing political legal and economic uncertainty in the uk and wider european markets such uncertainty could cause volatility in currency exchange rates in interest rates and in eu uk or worldwide political regulatory economic or market conditions and could contribute to instability in political institutions regulatory agencies and financial markets and may cause clients to closely monitor their costs and reduce their spending on our solutions and services 

in particular the economies of the uk and eu member states and individual businesses operating in one or more of those jurisdictions may be adversely affected by the restrictions on the ability to provide crossborder services from the uk into the eu and vice versa the introduction of nontariff and in the future potentially tariff barriers customs checks andor duties changes in tax including withholding tax restrictions on the movements of employees and restrictions on the transfer of personal data in addition there are likely to be changes in the legal rights and obligations of commercial parties across all industries particularly in the services sector including financial services following the uks exit from the eu despite the trade and cooperation agreement any delays with the approval of the trade and cooperation agreement by the european parliament its potentially problematic provisions or its potentially uncertain interpretation could adversely and significantly affect european or worldwide economic or market conditions and may contribute to instability in global financial and foreign exchange markets and could lead to legal uncertainty and divergent national laws and regulations any of these effects of brexit and others which cannot be anticipated could adversely affect our business business opportunities financial condition cash flows and operating results 

our business is subject to the risks of international operations including movements in foreign currency exchange rates 

the international operations of fis represented approximately 26 of our total 2021 revenue and are largely conducted in currencies other than the us dollar including the british pound sterling euro brazilian real indian rupee and australian dollar fis continues to expand its international presence by offering merchant acquiring services including ecommerce outside of the us our business and financial results could be adversely affected due to a variety of factors including the following 

• changes in a specific country or regions political and cultural climate or economic condition including change in governmental regime 

• unexpected or unfavorable changes in foreign laws regulatory requirements and related interpretations 

• difficulty of effective enforcement of contractual provisions in local jurisdictions 

• inadequate intellectual property protection in foreign countries 

• tradeprotection measures import or export licensing requirements such as export administration regulations promulgated by the us department of commerce and fines penalties or suspension or revocation of export privileges 

• trade sanctions imposed by the us or other governments with jurisdictional authority over our business operations 

• the effects of applicable and potentially adverse foreign tax law changes 

• significant adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates 

• lesser enforcement of intellectual property laws and protections internationally 

• longer accounts receivable cycles 

• managing a geographically dispersed workforce 

• trade treaties tariffs or agreements that could adversely affect our ability to do business in affected countries and 

• compliance with the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa and the office of foreign assets control regulations particularly in emerging markets 

as we expand our international operations more of our clients may pay us in foreign currencies conducting business in currencies other than the us dollar subjects us to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates that can negatively impact our results period to period including relative to analyst estimates or guidance our primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to foreign currencies in europe including the uk brazil and parts of asia the us dollar value of our net investments in foreign operations the periodic conversion of foreigndenominated earnings to the us dollar our reporting currency and our results of operations and in some cases cash flows could be adversely affected in a material manner by movements in foreign currency exchange rates these risks could cause an adverse effect on the business financial position and results of operations of the company 

failure to comply with antibribery and anticorruption laws and sanctions laws could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences 

we are subject to the fcpa the uk bribery act ofac and other antibribery anticorruption and antimoney laundering laws as well as sanctions laws in various countries around the world the fcpa the uk bribery act and similar applicable laws generally prohibit companies as well as their officers directors employees and thirdparty intermediaries business partners and agents from making improper payments or providing other improper things of value to government officials or other persons for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business abroad or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment the fcpa also requires that us public companies maintain books and records that fairly and accurately reflect transactions and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls 

we conduct business in many foreign countries including a number of countries with developing economies and many of our employees thirdparty intermediaries and agents in such countries may have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies state owned or affiliated entities and other third parties where we may be held liable if they take actions in violation of these laws even if we do not explicitly authorize them although our policies and procedures require compliance with these laws and are designed to facilitate compliance with these laws we do business in many countries all over the world and cannot assure that our employees contractors or agents somewhere in the world will not take actions in violation of applicable laws or our policies for which we may be ultimately held responsible 

in the event that we believe or have reason to believe that our employees contractors or agents have or may have violated such laws we may be required to investigate or to have outside counsel investigate the relevant facts and circumstances detecting investigating and resolving actual or alleged violations can be extensive and require a significant diversion of time resources and attention from senior management further we cannot assure that any such investigation will successfully uncover all relevant facts and circumstances any violation of the fcpa the uk bribery act or other applicable antibribery or anticorruption laws could result in whistleblower complaints adverse media coverage investigations loss of export privileges and criminal or civil sanctions penalties and fines any of which could adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

we are also subject to sanctions laws administered by ofac as well as the eu the un security council and her majestys treasury of the united kingdom among others these sanctions laws prohibit us from doing certain types of business with prohibited individuals entities and sanctioned countries around the world any violation of these sanctions laws could result in adverse media coverage investigations loss of export privileges and criminal or civil sanctions penalties and fines any of which could adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

we have businesses in emerging markets that may experience significant economic volatility 

we have operations in emerging markets primarily in latin america india southeast asia the middle east and africa these emerging market economies tend to be more volatile than the more established markets we serve in north america and europe which could add volatility to our future revenue and earnings 

acts of war or terrorism international conflicts political instability natural disasters or widespread outbreak of an illness could negatively affect various aspects of our business including our workforce and our business partners make it more difficult and expensive to meet our obligations to our customers and result in reduced revenue from our customers 

our global operations are susceptible to global events including acts or threats of war or terrorism international conflicts political instability and natural disasters we are also susceptible to a widespread outbreak of an illness or other health issue such as the ongoing covid19 outbreak these events can spread to different locations across the globe and can have an adverse effect on the global economy reducing consumer and corporate spending upon which our revenue depends individual employees can become ill quarantined or otherwise unable to work andor travel due to health reasons or governmental restrictions some of our operations are in countries where the effects of a widespread illness could be magnified due to health care systems that are less welldeveloped than in the us the occurrence of any of these events including the potential future effects of the covid19 outbreak could have an adverse effect on our business results and financial condition 

failure to attract and retain talent including senior management and highly skilled technology personnel could harm our ability to grow 

our future success depends upon our ability to attract and retain talent in a competitive market including senior management personnel and highlyskilled technology personnel the competitive nature of this market is also affected by wage inflation which will generally increase the cost of talent because the development of our solutions and services requires knowledge skills and abilities to create develop and implement our software solutions in new areas on a continuing basis we are competing for talented people with such knowledge skills and abilities in new and developing technologies competition for such technical personnel is intense as is the competition for senior management to lead these efforts and our failure to hire and retain talented personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

our future growth will also require sales and marketing financial legal and administrative personnel to develop and support new solutions and services to enhance and support current solutions and services and to expand operational and financial systems there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain the necessary personnel to accomplish our growth strategies and we may experience constraints that could adversely affect our ability to satisfy client demand in a timely fashion 

our ability to maintain compliance with applicable laws rules and regulations and to manage and monitor the risks facing our business relies upon the ability to maintain skilled compliance legal security risk and audit professionals competition for such skill sets is intense and our failure to hire and retain talented personnel could have an adverse effect on our internal control environment and impact our operating results 

our senior management team has significant experience in the financial services industry and the loss of this leadership could have an adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition further the loss of this leadership may have an adverse impact on senior managements ability to provide effective oversight and strategic direction for all key functions within the company which could impact our future business operating results and financial condition 

we are the subject of various legal proceedings that could have an adverse effect on our revenue and profitability 

we are involved in various litigation matters in the ordinary course of business including in some instances classaction cases and patent infringement litigation if we are unsuccessful in our defense of litigation matters we may be forced to pay damages andor change our business practices any of which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

unfavorable resolution of tax contingencies or unfavorable future tax law changes could adversely affect our tax expense 

our tax returns and positions are subject to review and audit by federal state local and international taxing authorities an unfavorable outcome to a tax audit could result in higher tax expense and could negatively impact our effective tax rate financial position results of operations and cash flows in the current andor future periods unfavorable future tax law changes could result in negative impacts in addition taxlaw amendments in the us and other jurisdictions could significantly impact 

how us multinational corporations are taxed although we cannot predict whether or in what form such legislation will pass if enacted it could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results 

a material weakness in our internal controls could have a material adverse effect on us 

effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reasonable assurance with respect to our financial reports and to adequately mitigate risk of fraud if we cannot provide reasonable assurance with respect to our financial reports and adequately mitigate risk of fraud our reputation and operating results could be harmed internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations including the possibility of human error the circumvention or overriding of controls or fraud therefore even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements in addition projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

a material weakness is a deficiency or combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the companys annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting could adversely impact our ability to provide timely and accurate financial information if we are unable to report financial information timely and accurately or to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures we could adversely affect our business prospects 

risks related to business combinations and ventures 

strategic transactions including acquisitions and divestitures involve significant risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

strategic acquisitions and divestitures we have made in the past and may make in the future present significant risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows these risks include the following 

• difficulty in evaluating potential acquisitions including the risk that our due diligence does not identify or fully assess valuation issues potential liabilities or other acquisition risks 

• difficulty and expense in integrating newly acquired businesses and operations including combining solution and service offerings and in entering into new markets in which we are not experienced in an efficient and costeffective manner while maintaining adequate standards controls and procedures and the risk that we encounter significant unanticipated costs or other problems associated with integration 

• difficulty and expense in consolidating and rationalizing it infrastructure and integrating acquired software 

• challenges in achieving strategic objectives cost savings and other benefits expected from acquisitions 

• risk that our markets do not evolve as anticipated and that the strategic acquisitions and divestitures do not prove to be those needed to be successful in those markets 

• risk that acquired systems expose us to cybersecurity and other data security risks 

• costs to reach appropriate standards to protect against cybersecurity and other data security risks or timeline to achieve such standards may exceed those estimated in diligence 

• risk that acquired companies are subject to new regulatory regimes or oversight where we have limited experience that may result in additional compliance costs and potential regulatory penalties 

• risk that we assume or retain or that companies we have acquired have assumed or retained or otherwise become subject to significant liabilities that exceed the limitations of any applicable indemnification provisions or the financial resources of any indemnifying parties 

• risk that indemnification related to businesses divested or spunoff that we may be required to provide or otherwise bear may be significant and could negatively impact our business 

• risk of exposure to potential liabilities arising out of applicable state and federal fraudulent conveyance laws and legal distribution requirements from spinoffs in which we or companies we have acquired were involved 

• risk that we may be responsible for us federal income tax liabilities related to acquisitions or divestitures 

• risk that we are not able to complete strategic divestitures on satisfactory terms and conditions including noncompetition arrangements applicable to certain of our business lines or within expected time frames 

• potential loss of key employees or customers of the businesses acquired or to be divested and 

• risk of diverting the attention of senior management from our existing operations 

we have substantial goodwill and other intangible assets recorded as a result of acquisitions and a severe or extended economic downturn could cause these assets to become impaired requiring writedowns that would reduce our operating income 

as of december 31 2021 goodwill aggregated to 533 billion or 64 of total assets and intangible assets aggregated to 115 billion or 14 of total assets current accounting rules require goodwill to be assessed for impairment at least annually or whenever changes in circumstances indicate potential impairment and require intangible assets with finite useful lives to be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable factors that may be considered a change in circumstance include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results a significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization and negative industry or economic trends we recorded 94 million in goodwill impairment related to certain nonstrategic businesses in the corporate and other segment during the fourth quarter of 2020 no other impairment for goodwill and other intangible assets was identified during the year ended december 31 2020 there were no goodwill or other intangible asset impairments identified during the year ended december 31 2021 if worldwide or us economic conditions decline significantly with negative impacts to bank spending and consumer behavior or if other business or market changes impact our outlook then the carrying amount of our goodwill and other intangible assets may no longer be recoverable and we may be required to record an impairment charge which would have a negative impact on our results of operations we will continue to monitor the fair value of our goodwill and other intangible assets as well as our market capitalization and the impact of any economic downturn on our business to determine if there is an impairment in future periods 

risks related to our indebtedness 

our existing debt levels and future levels under existing facilities and debt service requirements may adversely affect fis including our financial condition or business flexibility and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our outstanding indebtedness 

as of december 31 2021 we had total debt of approximately 204 billion this level of debt or any increase in our debt level could adversely affect our business financial condition operating results and operational flexibility including the following i the debt level may cause us to have difficulty borrowing money in the future for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions or other purposes ii our debt level may limit operational flexibility and our ability to pursue business opportunities and implement certain business strategies iii some of our debt has a variable rate of interest which exposes us to the risk of increased interest rates iv we have a higher level of debt than some of our competitors or potential competitors which may cause a competitive disadvantage and may reduce flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions including increased competition and vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  v there are significant maturities on our debt that we may not be able to repay at maturity or that may be refinanced at higher rates and vi if we fail to satisfy our obligations under our outstanding debt or fail to comply with the financial or other restrictive covenants contained in the indenture governing our senior notes or our credit facility an event of default could result that could cause all of our debt to become due and payable 

we may be adversely affected by changes in libor reporting practices or the method in which libor is determined 

as of december 31 2021 we had outstanding approximately 325 million of borrowings under our revolving credit facility an interest rate swap with a 19 billion notional amount designated as a fair value hedge and a crosscurrency interest rate swap with a 441 million notional amount designated as a net investment hedge that are indexed to the london interbank offered rate libor on july 27 2017 the fca which regulates libor announced that it will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of libor after 2021 in march 2021 the ice benchmark administration limited the administrator of libor extended the transition dates of certain libor tenors to june 30 2023 after which libor reference rates will cease to be provided despite this deferral the libor administrator has advised that no new contracts using us dollar libor should be entered into after december 31 2021 it is unknown whether any banks will continue to voluntarily submit rates for the calculation of libor or whether libor will continue to be published by its administrator based on these submissions or on any other basis after such dates 

regulators industry groups and certain committees such as the alternative reference rates committee arrc have among other things published recommended fallback language for liborlinked financial instruments identified recommended alternatives for certain libor rates such as the secured overnight financing rate sofr as the recommended alternative to us dollar libor and proposed implementations of the recommended alternatives in floatingrate financial instruments it is currently unknown the extent to which these recommendations and proposals will be broadly 

accepted whether they will continue to evolve and what the effect of their implementation may be on the markets for floatingrate financial instruments 

at this time it is not possible to predict the effect that these developments or any discontinuance modification or other reforms may have on libor other benchmarks or floatingrate financial instruments including our floatingrate debt any such discontinuance modification alternative reference rates or other reforms may materially adversely affect interest rates on our current indebtedness 

our euro and gbpdenominated indebtedness has increased in recent years accordingly we have increased exposure to fluctuations in the eurousd and gbpusd exchange rates which could negatively affect our cost to service or refinance our euro and gbpdenominated debt securities 

in recent years our indebtedness denominated in euro or gbp has significantly increased as a result of our issuance of senior notes of varying maturities and our issuance of eurodenominated commercial paper at december 31 2021 the company had outstanding approximately €68 billion aggregate principal amount of eurodenominated senior notes approximately €15 billion aggregate principal amount of eurodenominated commercial paper and approximately £12 billion aggregate principal amount of gbpdenominated senior notes or the combined equivalent of approximately 110 billion aggregate principal amount 

although we currently have substantial available cash flows in excess of the projected debt service requirements on our existing euro and gbpdenominated debt we cannot assure that we will be always be able to continue generating earnings in euros and gbp in amounts sufficient taking into account the funding requirements and other needs of our business to make payments of interest andor repayment of principal on our euro and gbp senior debt or to permit us to economically borrow in those currencies if needed to refinance our existing euro and gbp debt if our cash flows in euros or gbp are insufficient for such purposes we may need to exchange us dollars or funds in other currencies to make such payments which could result in increased costs to us in the event of adverse changes in currency exchange rates we have utilized and expect to continue to utilize foreign currency forward contracts and other hedges on a limited basis in an effort to mitigate currency risk but we cannot assure that such hedging arrangements will be effective or will remain available to us on acceptable terms or at all in addition we cannot predict economic and market conditions including prevailing interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates at the applicable times when our various series of euro and gbp senior debt are scheduled to mature nor can there be any assurance that we would be able to refinance any series of our euro and gbp senior debt in those currencies on acceptable terms at any such time all of which could have an adverse financial impact on us 

rising interest rates could increase our borrowing costs 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our shortterm commercial paper borrowings revolving credit facility and interest rate derivatives in the future we may have additional borrowings under existing or new variablerate debt increases in interest rates on variablerate debt would increase our interest expense a rising interest rate environment could increase the cost of refinancing existing debt and incurring new debt which could have an adverse effect on our financing costs 

credit ratings if lowered below investment grade would adversely affect our cost of funds and liquidity 

the company maintains investment grade credit ratings from the major us rating agencies on its senior unsecured debt sp bbb moodys baa2 fitch bbb as well as its commercial paper program sp a2 moodys p2 fitch f2 failure to maintain investment grade rating levels could adversely affect the companys cost of funds and liquidity and access to certain capital markets but would not have an adverse effect on the companys ability to access its existing revolving credit facility please note that a security rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities that it may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and that each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating

the following section discusses managements view of the financial condition and results of operations of fis and its consolidated subsidiaries as of december 31 2021 and 2020 and for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 unless otherwise noted 

this section should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forwardlooking statements see forwardlooking information and  risk factors  in item 1a of this annual report for a discussion of the uncertainties risks and assumptions associated with these forwardlooking statements that could cause future results to differ materially from those reflected in this section 

business trends and conditions 

our revenue is primarily derived from a combination of technology and processing services transaction fees professional services and software license fees while we are a global company and do business around the world the majority of our revenue is generated by clients in the us the majority of our international revenue is generated by clients in the uk germany australia brazil canada and india in addition the majority of our revenue has historically been recurring and has been provided under multiyear banking and capital markets contracts that contribute relative stability to our revenue stream these services in general are considered critical to our clients operations although merchant has a lesser percentage of multiyear contracts substantially all of our merchant revenue is recurring derived from transaction processing fees that fluctuate with the number or value of transactions processed among other variable measures associated with consumer activity professional services revenue is typically nonrecurring though recognition often occurs over time rather than at a point in time sales of software licenses are typically nonrecurring with pointintime recognition and are less predictable 

the distribution of vaccines against covid19 curtailed the impact of the pandemic in 2021 in many of the larger countries in which we do business but the timing of a complete recovery remains uncertain as new variants of covid19 continue to impact consumer spending economic activity increased in many areas throughout 2021 including most notably an increase in consumer and business spending by digital methods compared to 2020 when the impact of covid19 first arose in the fourth quarter of 2021 some governmental restrictions were reimposed based upon a resurgence of variants of covid19 in many areas of the us and europe which resulted in an adverse impact on payment volumes and transactions over those anticipated following the easing of restrictions in the prior two quarters in addition we have continued to see adverse impacts on spending in discretionary spending verticals including travel airlines and restaurants although the impact has lessened compared to 2020 these changes in spending affected our business results of operations and financial condition throughout 2021 and will likely continue to have an impact in 2022 although the magnitude and duration of their ultimate effect is not possible to predict 

we extended higherthanusual levels of credit to our merchant clients during the first part of the pandemic as part of funds settlement in connection with payments to their customers for among other things refunds for cancelled trips as cases of covid19 spread across the globe the level of credit extended to our merchant clients has since normalized we are potentially exposed to losses if our merchant customers are unable to repay the credit we have extended or to fund their liability for chargebacks due to closure insolvency bankruptcy or other reasons our potential liability for chargebacks did not have a material impact on our liquidity for the three and twelvemonth periods ended december 31 2021 and we continue to monitor for impact on our liquidity results of operations and financial condition 

we continue to assist financial institutions in migrating to outsourced integrated technology solutions to improve their profitability and address increasing and ongoing regulatory requirements as a provider of outsourced solutions we benefit from multiyear recurring revenue streams which help moderate the effects of broader yeartoyear economic and market 

changes that otherwise might have a larger impact on our results of operations we believe our integrated solutions and outsourced services are wellpositioned to address this outsourcing trend across the markets we serve 

over the last five years we have moved over 80 of our server compute primarily in north america to our fis cloud located in our strategic data centers this allows us to further enhance security for our clients data and increases the flexibility and speed with which we can provide solutions and services to our clients at lesser cost we have also completed our data center consolidation program in 2021 generating savings for the company of over 250 million in runrate annual expense since the programs inception in mid2016 

following the successful modernization of our it infrastructure and consolidation of our data centers we are now accelerating the modernization of our strategic applications and sunsetting of our redundant platforms our multiyear platform modernization initiative is designed to create a componentized cloudnative set of capabilities that can be consumed by clients as endtoend business applications or as individual components although our platform modernization will result in additional nearterm costs we expect it will result in improvements in our operational efficiencies over time 

we continue to invest in modernization innovation and integrated solutions and services to meet the demands of the markets we serve and compete with global banks financial and other technology providers and emerging technology innovators we invest both organically and through investment opportunities in companies building complementary technologies in the financial services space our internal efforts in research and development activities have related primarily to the modernization of our proprietar y core systems in each of our segments design and development of nextgeneration digital and innovative solutions and development of processing systems and related software applications and risk management platforms we have increased our investments in these areas in each of the last three years we expect to continue our practice of investing an appropriate level of resources to maintain enhance and extend the functionality of our proprietary systems and existing software applications to develop new and innovative software applications and systems to address emerging technology trends in response to the needs of our clients and to enhance the capabilities of our outsourcing infrastructure we will also be developing software that will accelerate bringing new capabilities and innovation to market 

in addition we are investing in the development of new solutions and venture opportunities by establishing fis impact ventures this group prioritizes development of and investment in nextgeneration technology and innovation 

since the beginning of the pandemic the company has taken several actions to protect its employees while maintaining business continuity including implementing its comprehensive pandemic plan for example when the covid19 variants impacted india in the second quarter we rolled out several benefits to help our employees there including providing vaccines to over 15000 employees and dependents the pandemic plan includes sitespecific plans as well as travel restrictions medical response protocols workfromhome strategies and enhanced cleaning within our locations as a critical infrastructure provider for the global economy fis continues to operate around the world to serve our clients 

the spread of covid19 has caused us to modify our business practices and we may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or as we determine are in the best interests of our employees clients and business partners while fis has outfitted employees to provide services from home or transferred work to other locations we recently began a limited reopening of offices in certain locations where the covd19 infection rates have been significantly reduced in many locations a hybrid work status will allow employees to work from home and the office 

consumer preference continues to shift from traditional branch banking services to digital banking solutions and our clients seek to provide a single integrated banking experience through their branch mobile internet and voice banking channels the covid19 pandemic has resulted in accelerating digitization of banking and payment services by requiring in many cases banks and bank customers to transact through digital channels we have been providing our large regional banking customers in the us with digital one an integrated digital banking platfor m and are now adding functionality and offering digital one to our community bank clients to provide a consistent omnichannel experience for consumers of banking services across selfservice channels like mobile banking and online banking as well as supporting channels for bank staff operating in bank branches and contact centers the uniform customer experience extends to support a broad range of financial services including opening new accounts servicing of existing accounts money movement and personal financial management as well as other consumer small business and commercial banking capabilities digital one is integrated into several of the core banking platforms offered by fis and is also offered to customers of nonfis core banking systems 

we anticipate consolidation within the banking industry will continue primarily in the form of merger and acquisition activity among financial institutions which we believe would broadly be detrimental to the profitability of the financial technology industry however consolidation resulting from specific merger and acquisition transactions may be beneficial to 

our business when consolidations of financial institutions occur merger partners often operate systems obtained from competing service providers the newly formed entity generally makes a determination to migrate its core and payments systems to a single platform when a financial institution processing client is involved in a consolidation we may benefit by their expanding the use of our services if such services are chosen to survive the consolidation and to support the newly combined entity conversely we may lose revenue if we are providing services to both entities or if a client of ours is involved in a consolidation and our services are not chosen to survive the consolidation and to support the newly combined entity it is also possible that larger financial institutions resulting from consolidation may have greater leverage in negotiating terms or could decide to perform inhouse some or all of the services that we currently provide or could provide we seek to mitigate the risks of consolidations by offering other competitive services to take advantage of specific opportunities at the surviving company 

as of the end of 2021 our achievement of revenue synergies from the worldpay acquisition have exceeded our targets driven by successful crosssell of our heritage fis solutions into heritage worldpay clients and leveraging our heritage worldpay sales and distribution teams expanding on our existing relationships with financial institutions to establish merchant referral agreements and optimizing our network routing capabilities we have also exceeded our original target for expense synergies as we have successfully integrated organizational structures reduced corporate overhead and achieved cost savings within our operating environment 

we continue to see demand in the payments market for innovative solutions that will deliver faster more convenient payment options in mobile channels internet applications instore cards and the growing area of cryptocurrencies the payment processing industry is adopting new technologies developing new solutions and services evolving new business models and being affected by new market entrants and by an evolving regulatory environment as merchants and financial institutions respond to these changes by seeking services to help them enhance their own offerings to consumers including the ability to accept cardnotpresent cnp payments in ecommerce and mobile environments as well as contactless cards and mobile wallets at the pointofsale fis believes that payment processors will seek to develop additional capabilities in order to serve clients evolving needs to facilitate this expansion we believe that payment processors will need to enhance their technology platforms so they can deliver these capabilities and differentiate their offerings from other providers the covid19 pandemic has accelerated digitization of payment services by requiring in many cases businesses and consumers to transact through digital channels 

we believe that these market changes present both an opportunity and a risk for us and we cannot predict which emerging technologies or solutions will be successful however fis believes that payment processors like fis that have scalable integrated business models provide solutions across the payment processing value chain and utilize broad distribution capabilities will be best positioned to enable emerging alternative electronic payment technologies further fis believes that its depth of capabilities and breadth of distribution will enhance its position as emerging payment technologies are adopted by merchants and other businesses fis ability to partner with nonfinancial institution enterprises such as mobile payment providers and internet retail and social media companies continues to create attractive growth opportunities as these new entrants seek to become more active participants in the development of alternative electronic payment technologies and to facilitate the convergence of retail online mobile and social commerce applications 

globally attacks on information technology systems continue to grow in frequency complexity and sophistication this is a trend we expect to continue such attacks have become a point of focus for individuals businesses and governmental entities the objectives of these attacks include among other things gaining unauthorized access to systems to facilitate financial fraud disrupt operations cause denial of service events corrupt data and steal nonpublic information these circumstances present both a threat and an opportunity for fis as part of our business we electronically receive process store and transmit a wide range of confidential information including sensitive customer information and personal consumer data we also operate payment cash access and prepaid card systems 

fis remains focused on making strategic investments in information security to protect our clients and our information systems these investments include both capital expenditures and operating expense related to hardware software personnel and consulting services we also participate in industry and governmental initiatives to improve information security for our clients through the expertise we have gained with this ongoing focus and involvement we have developed fraud security risk management and compliance solutions to target this growth opportunity in the financial services industry 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the accounting policies and estimates described below are those we consider critical in preparing our consolidated financial statements these policies require management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported 

amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures with respect to contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods actual amounts could differ from those estimates see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed description of the significant accounting policies that have been followed in preparing our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

the most critical judgments required in applying asc 606 revenue recognition from customers and our revenue recognition policy relate to the determination of whether we are the principal or the agent with respect to transactions involving third parties the determination of distinct performance obligations and the evaluation of the standalone selling price for each performance obligation 

the company generates revenue in a number of ways including from the delivery of account or transactionbased processing saas bpaas cloud offerings software licensing softwarerelated services and professional services certain contracts contain nonstandard terms that require judgment to determine the appropriate impact on revenue recognition 

technology or services from third parties are frequently embedded in or combined with our applications or service offerings whether we recognize revenue based on the gross amount billed to a customer as a principal or the net amount retained as an agent involves judgment that depends on the relevant facts and circumstances including whether the company has control of the technology or service prior to it being transferred to the customer and the level of contractual responsibilities and obligations for delivering the application or service 

contracts containing multiple promised solutions or services require judgment to determine whether individual promised solutions or services can be considered distinct or should instead be combined with other promised solutions or services in the contract we assess the solutions and services promised in our contracts with customers and identify a performance obligation for each promise to transfer to the customer a solution or service or bundle of solutions or services that is distinct  ie if a solution or service is separately identifiable from other items in the bundled package and if a customer can benefit from it on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the customer 

the transaction price including any discounts or rebates is allocated among distinct goods and services in a contract that includes multiple performance obligations based on their relative standalone selling prices judgment may be required to determine standalone selling prices for each performance obligation and whether it depicts the amount we expect to receive in exchange for the related good or service for performance obligations that are not sold separately we estimate the standalone selling prices considering all reasonably available information and maximizing observable inputs using various approaches including historical pricing cost plus margin adjusted market and residual approaches the costplusmargin approach in particular requires judgment including the estimation of the costs required to complete the performance obligation these estimates are based primarily on the scope and complexity of the obligation platform migration timelines expected account or transaction volumes and internal and external labor rates we have not made significant changes in our cost estimates under this approach in the reporting period for significant contracts for which the costplusmargin approach was used to estimate the standalone selling price a 10 change in our cost assumptions would not have a significant impact on the amount reported during the period 

due to the large number broad nature and average size of our individual customer contracts the impact of judgments and assumptions that we apply in recognizing revenue for any single contract is not likely to have a material effect on our consolidated operations or financial position however the accounting policies that we apply across similar contracts products or classes of clients could significantly influence the timing and amount of revenue recognized in our historical and future results of operations or financial position 

purchase accounting 

we allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction at their estimated fair values the estimates used to determine the fair value of longlived assets such as intangible assets and software are complex and require a significant amount of management judgment we typically engage thirdparty valuation specialists to assist us in making fair value determinations the thirdparty valuation specialists generally use discounted cash flow models which require internallydeveloped assumptions to determine the acquisition fair value of customer relationship intangible assets and developed technology software assets assumptions for customer relationship asset valuations typically include forecasted revenue attributable to existing customer contracts and relationships estimated annual attrition forecasted ebitda margin and estimated weighted average cost of capital and discount rates assumptions for software asset valuations 

typically include forecasted revenue attributable to the software assets obsolescence rates estimated royalty rates and estimated weighted average cost of capital and discount rates the forecasted revenue and ebitda margins used in the discounted cash flow models are critical estimates in determining the fair value of customer relationships and developed technology software assets as these estimates are influenced by many factors including historical financial information and management’s expectation for future operating results as a combined company 

while we use our best estimates and assumptions to determine the fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement as a result during the measurement period which may be up to one year from the acquisition date we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed upon the conclusion of the measurement period any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of earnings 

see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of the payrix acquisition in 2021 the virtus acquisition in 2020 and worldpay acquisition in 2019 the payrix acquisition in the current year is not considered material to warrant additional disclosure regarding estimation uncertainty 

goodwill impairment 

the company assesses goodwill for impairment by reporting unit on an annual basis during the fourth quarter or more frequently if circumstances indicate potential impairment our reporting units are the same as our primary operating segments with additional reporting units for certain nonstrategic businesses within the corporate and other segment goodwill impairment assessments require a significant amount of management judgment and a meaningful change in one or more of the underlying forecasts estimates or assumptions used in testing goodwill for impairment could result in a material impact on the companys results of operations and financial position based on the results of our assessments 94 million of goodwill related to certain nonstrategic businesses within the corporate and other segment was impaired in 2020 for all other reporting units for all periods presented goodwill was not impaired 

our impairment test may first consider qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that a reporting units carrying amount exceeds its fair value qualitative factors include macroeconomic conditions industry and market conditions cost factors overall financial performance and events affecting the reporting unit or company as a whole including a sustained decrease in stock price if we conclude that it is more likely than not that the reporting units fair value is less than its carrying amount as a result of the qualitative assessment or we elect to bypass the qualitative assessment for a reporting unit then we must perform the quantitative assessment for that reporting unit 

when a quantitative assessment is triggered we typically engage thirdparty valuation specialists to assist us in determining the fair value of the reporting unit based on a weighted average of multiple valuation techniques typically a combination of an income approach and a market approach the income approach calculates a value based upon the present value of estimated future cash flows while the market approach uses earnings multiples of similarly situated guideline public companies the income approach involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions regarding forecasted revenue growth rates operating margins capital expenditures and other factors used to calculate estimated future cash flows in addition riskadjusted discount rates and future economic and market conditions and other assumptions are applied the market approach involves the selection of guideline public companies and earnings multiples considering factors such as markets of operation solutions offered and risk profiles the income approach used to assess goodwill for impairment is a critical estimate because the forecasted growth rate assumption including longterm growth assumption underlying the estimated future cash flows is subject to management’s judgment based upon the best available market information internal forecasts and operating plans a deterioration in this assumption could adversely impact our results 

for each of 2021 and 2019 we began our annual assessment with the qualitative assessment and concluded that it remained more likely than not that the fair value of each of our reporting units continued to exceed their respective carrying amounts for 2020 we began our annual assessment for the banking solutions and capital market solutions reporting units with qualitative assessments and concluded that it remained more likely than not that the fair value of each of the reporting units continued to exceed their respective carrying amounts based on the qualitative assessments performed for the banking solutions and capital market solutions reporting units and the substantial excess of fair value over carrying amount in our previous thirdparty valuations performed in 2015 for the related businesses we believe the likelihood of obtaining materially different results based on a change of assumptions is low 

for merchant solutions we began our 2020 annual assessment with a quantitative assessment due to the economic impact of the covid19 pandemic on our merchant solutions business and its primary operations being recently acquired as part of the worldpay acquisition as a result of the assessment the fair value of the reporting unit was estimated to be in excess of its 

carrying amount by approximately 4 the fair value was determined with the assistance of thirdparty valuation specialists using an equal weighting of the income and market approaches based on an evaluation of the availability and relevance of guideline public companies having similar risks participating in similar markets and providing similar solutions for their customers under the income approach for the merchant solutions reporting unit management estimated the fair value by forecasting future cash flows using internal forecasts which were developed considering historical operating performance expected economic conditions and industry and market trends including the impact of the covid19 global pandemic and expected impact of planned business initiatives at the end of the forecast period we used a longterm growth rate to determine the terminal value based on an evaluation of the minimum expected terminal growth rate of the merchant solutions reporting unit as well as broader economic considerations such as inflation and foreign exchange rates in computing the present value of estimated future cash flows we used a riskadjusted discount rate based on an assessment of the weighted average cost of capital for the merchant solutions reporting unit and relevant guideline public companies we believe the discount rate used was commensurate with the risks and uncertainties inherent in the merchant solutions business and in our internally developed forecasts though the rate is subject to change in future periods based on changes in the us treasury rate inflation and other factors 

for merchant solutions in 2021 we performed a qualitative assessment for our annual assessment in addition to the factors noted above that are considered when performing such an assessment we considered actual results for 2021 and updated internal forecasts as compared to prior internal forecasts and other assumptions used in the 2020 quantitative annual assessment as a result of the assessment we determined that the indicated fair value of the reporting unit was estimated to be in excess of carrying amount by a similar percentage as determined by the prior year’s quantitative assessment we concluded for 2021 that it remained more likely than not that the fair value of the merchant solutions reporting unit continued to exceed its carrying amount however given the results of the 2020 quantitative and 2021 qualitative annual assessments the reporting unit is at risk for future goodwill impairment as it is reasonably possible that future developments related to the economic impact of the covid19 pandemic on our merchant solutions business such as an extended duration of the pandemic andor governmentimposed shutdowns prolonged economic downturn or recession or lack of governmental support for recovery could have a material impact on one or more of the estimates and assumptions used to evaluate goodwill impairment and could result in future goodwill impairment

revenue 

revenue increased primarily due to the continued global economic recovery from the covid19 pandemic leading to increased merchant volumes increased demand for our newly developed offerings in banking and strong new sales driving capital markets managed services and other recurring revenue growth revenue also benefited from a favorable foreign 

currency impact which was primarily related to a weaker us dollar versus the euro and the british pound sterling see segment results of operations below for more detailed explanation 

cost of revenue gross profit and gross profit margin 

cost of revenue increased primarily due to the revenue variances noted above and benefited from a positive shift in revenue mix gross profit and gross profit margin increased primarily due to revenue growth a positive shift in revenue mix and continued expense management this increase was partially offset by 183 million of incremental amortization expense associated with shortened estimated useful lives and accelerated amortization methods for certain software and deferred contract cost assets driven by the companys platform modernization 

selling general and administrative expenses 

selling general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to higher compensation expense including incentive compensation and accelerated stock compensation expense recorded during the first quarter of 2021 associated with the establishment of the qualified retirement equity program that modified our existing stock compensation plans as described in note 17 to the consolidated financial statements these increases were partially offset by lower discretionary spending during the covid19 pandemic 

asset impairments 

during 2021 the company recorded 202 million of asset impairments for certain software and deferred contract cost assets driven by the companys platform modernization during 2020 the company recorded asset impairments totaling 136 million related to goodwill for certain nonstrategic businesses and to certain longlived assets related to reducing office space 

operating income and operating margin 

the annual change in operating income resulted from the revenue and cost variances noted above the operating margin during 2021 increased primarily due to a positive shift in revenue mix and continued expense management partially offset by asset impairments of 202 million accelerated amortization expense and higher compensation expense discussed above as compared to prior year the operating margin during 2020 was negatively impacted by higher acquired intangible asset amortization expense higher acquisition integration and other costs and asset impairments of 136 million 

total other income expense net 

the decrease in interest expense net is primarily due to lower outstanding debt and lower weighted average interest rate on the outstanding debt throughout the year 

other income expense net for 2021 includes net gains on equity security investments without readily determinable fair values of 218 million see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements a gain on the sale of our equity ownership interest in cardinal holdings of approximately 225 million see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements and a loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately 528 million relating to tender premiums makewhole amounts and fees the writeoff of unamortized bond discounts and debt issuance costs and losses on related derivative instruments the foregoing loss resulted from the debt refinancing activity we undertook in the first quarter of 2021 see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements which will substantially reduce our ongoing interest expense other income expense net also includes fair value adjustments on certain other nonoperating assets and liabilities and foreign currency transaction remeasurement gains 

other income expense net for 2020 primarily includes the fair value adjustment on certain nonoperating assets and liabilities foreign currency transaction remeasurement gains an d losses and the settlement recorded for the reliance trust claims which is further described in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements 

provision benefit for income taxes 

the effective tax rate for the 2021 period includes the onetime net remeasurement of certain deferred tax liabilities due to the increase in the uk corporate statutory tax rate from 19 to 25 effective april 1 2023 enacted on june 10 2021 the effective tax rate for the 2020 period includes the onetime net remeasurement of certain deferred tax liabilities due to the increase in the uk corporate statutory tax rate from 17 to 19 enacted on july 22 2020

merchant solutions 

revenue increased primarily due to easing lockdown restrictions and the continued global economic recovery from the covid19 pandemic for 2021 revenue increased due to higher cardpresent volumes contributing 12 to growth and cardnotpresent volumes contributing 5 to growth revenue also benefited from a favorable foreign currency impact contributing 2 to growth and was primarily related to a weaker us dollar versus the british pound sterling 

adjusted ebitda increased primarily due to the revenue impacts noted above adjusted ebitda margin increased primarily due to revenue growth highermargin revenue mix and continued expense management 

banking solutions 

revenue increased primarily due to recurring revenue contributing 6 to growth driven by strong new sales including newly developed offerings and increased volumes due to the continued global economic recovery from the covid19 pandemic nonrecurring revenue also contributed 2 to growth primarily due to the timing of termination fees 

adjusted ebitda increased primarily due to the revenue impacts noted above adjusted ebitda margin increased primarily due to highermargin revenue mix and continued expense management 

capital market solutions 

revenue increased primarily due to recurring revenue contributing 4 and nonrecurring revenue contributing 3 to growth driven by strong new sales driving outsourced solutions and services as well as favorable timing of license renewals the growth of recurring revenue led to an increase in professional services revenue with much of the services being delivered in a virtual capacity given the ongoing covid19 pandemic revenue also benefited from a favorable foreign currency impact contributing 1 to growth and was primarily related to a weaker us dollar versus the british pound sterling 

adjusted ebitda increased primarily due to the revenue impacts noted above adjusted ebitda margin increased primarily due to highermargin revenue mix and continued expense management 

corporate and other 

the corporate and other segment results consist of selling general and administrative expenses and depreciation and intangible asset amortization not otherwise allocated to the reportable segments corporate and other also includes operations from certain nonstrategic businesses 

revenue decreased primarily due to client attrition in our nonstrategic businesses 

adjusted ebitda decreased primarily due to the revenue impact noted above as well as higher compensation expense compared to prior year 

liquidity and capital resources 

cash requirements 

our ongoing cash requirements include operating expenses income taxes tax receivable obligations mandatory debt service payments capital expenditures stockholder dividends regulatory requirements working capital and timing differences in settlementrelated assets and liabilities and may include discretionary debt repayments share repurchases and business acquisitions our principal sources of funds are cash generated by operations and borrowings including the capacity under our revolving credit facility the us commercial paper program and the eurocommercial paper program discussed in note 12 to the consolidated financial statements 

as of december 31 2021 the company had 3375 million of available liquidity including 2010 million of cash and cash equivalents and 1365 million of capacity available under its revolving credit facility approximately 900 million of cash and cash equivalents is held by our foreign entities including amounts related to regulatory requirements the majority of our domestic cash and cash equivalents relates to settlement payables and net depositsintransit which are typically settled within a few business days debt outstanding totaled 204 billion with an effective weighted average interest rate of 09 

the companys liquidity has improved during 2021 as compared to at the onset of the covid19 pandemic however our liquidity could be impacted if economic conditions deteriorate or as a result of governmental measures that might be imposed in response to the covid19 pandemic or any recurrence or related variants thereof 

the company remains committed to reducing its leverage incurred in the worldpay acquisition while ensuring ample liquidity and expects to reach its target leverage by the end of the second quarter of 2022 

we believe that our current level of cash and cash equivalents plus cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund our operating cash requirements capital expenditures and mandatory debt service payments for the next 12 months and the foreseeable future 

we currently expect to continue to pay quarterly dividends in january 2022 the board of directors approved a quarterly dividend increase of 21 to 047 per share beginning with the first quarter of 2022 a regular quarterly dividend of 047 per common share is payable on march 25 2022 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on march 11 2022 consistent with our capital allocation strategy we plan to increase our annual dividend approximately 20 per year over the next several years as compared to approximately 10 per year increases in recent years to gradually increase our dividend payout ratio beginning with the quarterly dividend payable in march 2022 however the amount declaration and payment of future dividends is at the discretion of the board of directors and depends on among other things our investment opportunities including potential mergers and acquisitions results of operations financial condition cash requirements future prospects the duration and impact of the covid19 pandemic and other factors that may be considered relevant by our board of directors including legal and contractual restrictions additionally the payment of cash dividends may be limited by covenants in certain debt agreements 

the share repurchase plan approved by the board of directors in 2017 expired as of december 31 2020 management temporarily suspended share repurchases during 2020 as a result of the worldpay transaction to accelerate debt repayment in january 2021 our board of directors approved a new share repurchase program under which it authorized the company to repurchase up to 100 million shares of our common stock at managements discretion from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions and through rule 10b51 plans the new share repurchase program has no expiration date and may be suspended for periods amended or discontinued at any time under the new share repurchase program the company repurchased approximately 15 million shares for 20 billion during 2021 approximately 85 million shares remain available for repurchase as of december 31 2021 in 2020 there were no share repurchases and in 2019 we repurchased approximately 4 million shares for 400 million 

cash flows from operations 

cash flows from operations were 4810 million 4442 million and 2410 million in 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively our net cash provided by operating activities consists primarily of net earnings adjusted to add back depreciation and amortization and other noncash items cash flows from operations increased 368 million in 2021 and 2032 million in 2020 the 2021 increase in cash flows from operations is primarily due to an increase in operating income partially offset by working capital and settlement timing the 2020 increase in cash flows from operations is primarily due to increased cash flow from the worldpay operations including the timing of settlement activity partially offset by worldpay integrationrelated expenses and lower net earnings from the covid19 pandemic

recent accounting pronouncements

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risks 

market risk 

we are exposed to market risks primarily from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates such risks may be exacerbated by the effects of the covid19 pandemic we periodically use certain derivative financial instruments including interest rate swaps and foreign currency forward contracts to manage interest rate and foreign currency risk we do not use derivatives for trading purposes to generate income or to engage in speculative activity 

interest rate risk 

in addition to existing cash balances and cash provided by operating activities we use fixedrate and variablerate debt to finance our operations we are exposed to interest rate risk on these debt obligations and related interest rate swaps 

our fixedrate senior notes as included in note 12 to the consolidated financial statements represent the majority of our fixedrate longterm debt obligations as of december 31 2021 the carrying value excluding the fair value of the interest rate swaps described below and unamortized discounts of our senior notes was 162 billion as of december 31 2021 the fair value of our senior notes was approximately 168 billion as of december 31 2021 the potential reduction in fair value of the senior notes from a hypothetical 10 percent increase in market interest rates would not be material to the overall fair value of the debt 

our variablerate risk principally relates to borrowings under our us commercial paper program eurocommercial paper program and revolving credit facility as included in note 12 to the consolidated financial statements and interest rate swaps on our fixedrate longterm debt collectively variablerate debt at december 31 2021 our weightedaverage cost of debt was 09 with a weightedaverage maturity of 54 years 62 of our debt was fixed rate and the remaining 38 was variablerate debt a 100 basispoint increase in the weightedaverage interest rate on our variablerate debt would have increased our 2021 annual interest expense by 78 million we performed the foregoing sensitivity analysis based solely on the principal amount of our variablerate debt as of december 31 2021 this sensitivity analysis does not take into account any changes that occurred in the prior 12 months or that may take place in the next 12 months in the amount of our outstanding debt further this sensitivity analysis assumes the change in interest rates is applicable for an entire year for comparison purposes based on principal amounts of variablerate debt outstanding as of december 31 2020 and calculated in the same manner as set forth above an increase of 100 basis points in the weightedaverage interest rate would have increased our annual interest expense by approximately 51 million 

as of december 31 2021 the following interest rate swaps converting the interest rate exposure on certain of our senior notes from fixed to variable are outstanding in millions 

by entering into the aforementioned swap agreements we have assumed risks associated with variable interest rates based upon libor changes in the overall level of interest rates affect the interest expense that we recognize we designated the interest rate swaps as fair value hedges for accounting purposes as described in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements a 100 basispoint increase in the 3month usd libor rate 6month gbp libor rate and 3month euribor rate as applicable for the interest rate swaps outstanding as of december 31 2021 and 2020 would increase our annual interest expense by approximately 37 million and 6 million respectively 

foreign currency risk 

we are exposed to foreign currency risks that arise from normal business operations these risks include the translation of local currency balances of foreign subsidiaries transaction gains and losses associated with intercompany loans with foreign subsidiaries and transactions denominated in currencies other than a locations functional currency we manage the exposure to these risks through a combination of normal operating activities and the use of foreign currency forward contracts and nonderivative and derivative investment hedges 

our exposure to foreign currency exchange risks generally arises from our nonus operations to the extent they are conducted in local currency changes in foreign currency exchange rates affect translations of revenue denominated in currencies other than the us dollar during the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 we generated approximately 2833 million 2432 million and 1852 million respectively in revenue denominated in currencies other than the us dollar the major currencies to which our revenue is exposed are the british pound sterling euro brazilian real indian rupee and australian dollar a 10 movement in average exchange rates for these currencies assuming a simultaneous and immediate 10 change in all of such rates for the relevant period would have resulted in the following increase or decrease in our reported revenue for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 in millions 



while our results of operations have been impacted by the effects of currency fluctuations our international operations revenue and expenses are generally denominated in local currency which reduces our economic exposure to foreign exchange risk in those jurisdictions 

our foreign exchange risk management policy permits the use of derivative instruments such as forward contracts and options to reduce volatility in our results of operations andor cash flows resulting from foreign exchange rate fluctuations we do not enter into foreign currency derivative instruments for trading purposes or to engage in speculative activity we do periodically enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge foreign currency exposure to intercompany loans and other balance sheet items the company also utilizes foreign currencydenominated debt and crosscurrency interest rate swaps designated as net investment hedges in order to reduce the volatility of the net investment value of certain of its euro and pound sterling functional subsidiaries see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements

information security 

globally attacks on information technology systems continue to grow in frequency complexity and sophistication this is a trend we expect to continue such attacks have become a point of focus for individuals businesses and governmental entities the objectives of these attacks include among other things gaining unauthorized access to systems to facilitate financial fraud disrupt operations cause denial of service events corrupt data and steal nonpublic information these circumstances present both a threat and an opportunity for fis as part of our business we electronically receive process store and transmit a wide range of confidential information including sensitive customer information and personal consumer data we also operate payment cash access and prepaid card systems

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the normal risks of business we are subject to significant risks and uncertainties including those listed below and others described elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k any of the risks described herein could result in a significant adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

risks related to our business and operations 

the extent to which the covid19 pandemic and measures taken in response thereto impact our business results of operations liquidity and financial condition will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and are difficult to predict 

global health concerns relating to the covid19 pandemic and related government actions taken to reduce the spread of the virus have been weighing on the macroeconomic environment and the pandemic has significantly increased economic uncertainty and reduced economic activity including consumer and business spending 

the pandemic has continued to result in government authorities implementing numerous measures to try to contain the virus such as travel bans and restrictions quarantines shelterinplace or total lockdown orders and business limitations and shutdowns governments around the globe have taken steps to mitigate some of the more severe anticipated economic effects of the virus but there can be no assurance that such steps will be effective or achieve their desired results in a timely fashion 

as us and foreign governmental authorities imposed social distancing shelterinplace or total lockdown orders spending declined most notably in discretionary spending verticals including travel airlines and restaurants resulting in a rapid deterioration in payments volume and transaction trends on a worldwide basis beginning in march 2020 which adversely impacted revenue in our payments businesses that earn transactionbased fees as such restrictions eased in the second and third quarters spending increased and the impact on our transactionbased fees rebounded in our banking and merchant segments except for areas such as travel and hospitality which remained largely restricted in the fourth quarter some restrictions were reimposed based upon a resurgence of the covid19 pandemic in many areas of the us and europe which resulted in an adverse impact on payments volumes and transactions over those anticipated following the easing of restrictions in the prior two quarters in addition we have experienced some slowdown in corporate decisionmaking on sales and implementation of our solutions as well as on software licenses and professional services these changes in spending affected our business results of operations and financial condition starting in the second quarter of 2020 through the end of the year and will likely continue to have such an impact although the magnitude and duration of their ultimate effect is not possible to predict the distribution of vaccines against covid19 beginning in late december could curtail the impact of the pandemic in 2021 although the timing remains uncertain 

we may experience additional pandemicrelated financial impacts due to a number of operational factors including 

• increased risk of merchant and card issuer failures and credit settlement and chargeback risk 

• increased risk of meeting client service contractual obligations due to government lockdown or other orders where it is not possible to provide certain clientfacing services from home or to promptly transfer them to other locations causing potential loss of revenue or contractual penalties due to failure to meet service level requirements as well as potential legal disputes and associated costs regarding force majeure or other related contract defenses 

• increased cyber and payment fraud risk related to covid19 as cybercriminals attempt to profit from the disruption given increased online banking ecommerce and other online activity 

• challenges to the availability and reliability of our solutions and services due to changes to normal operations including the possibility of one or more clusters of covid19 cases occurring at our data centers contact centers or operations centers affecting our employees or affecting the systems or employees of our clients or other third parties on which we depend 

• an increased volume of unanticipated client and regulatory requests for information and support or additional regulatory requirements which could require additional resources and costs to address including for example government initiatives to reduce or eliminate payments costs or fees to merchants 

• continued incremental costs directly related to covid19 although their magnitude is uncertain and 

• the general impact of recession and instability of markets across the globe 

the spread of covid19 has caused us to modify our business practices including restricting employee travel developing social distancing plans for our employees and cancelling physical participation in meetings events and conferences and replacing them where possible with virtual meetings events and conferences there is no certainty that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate all of the risks posed by the virus or will otherwise be satisfactory to government authorities further the ability of our senior management and employees to get to work has been disrupted across multiple locations whether in their 

own offices or at client sites due among other things to government work and travel restrictions including mandatory shutdowns where appropriate and plausible under local conditions we have moved the work from affected locations most of our employees are currently working remotely where they may not be as effective 

in addition  we have extended at times during 2020 higherthanusual levels of credit to our merchant clients as part of funds settlement in connection with payments to their customers for among other things refunds for cancelled trips and events if the speed of repayments to us by our merchant clients is substantially slower than expected over an extended period of time or if our merchant clients cease operations such that we are unable to collect on the credit advanced by us for these payments or for any chargeback liability it could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity results of operations and financial condition 

the extent to which the covid19 pandemic impacts our business results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and are difficult to predict including but not limited to the duration and spread of the pandemic its severity the actions to contain the virus or treat its impact and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume we may experience materially adverse impacts to our business as a result of the pandemics global economic impact including the availability of credit and our ability to comply with the covenants of our credit agreement adverse impacts on our liquidity the ability to meet our deleveraging targets and any recession that has occurred or may occur in the future such impacts may also have a material effect on one or more of the estimates and assumptions used to evaluate goodwill impairment and could result in future goodwill impairment additionally covid19 may have a material effect on our ability to pay our quarterly dividends at current levels or at all although it has not yet 

there are no comparable recent events that provide guidance as to the effect the spread and duration of covid19 as a global pandemic may have and as a result the ultimate impact of the pandemic is highly uncertain and subject to change we do not yet know the full extent of the impacts on our business our operations or the global economy as a whole however the impacts of the pandemic could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations liquidity or financial condition and heighten many of our known risks described in the remainder of this  risk factors section  

security breaches or attacks or our failure to comply with information security laws or regulations or industry security requirements could harm our business by disrupting delivery of services and damaging the reputation of fis and could result in a breach of one or more client contracts 

fis electronically receives processes stores and transmits sensitive business information of its clients in addition fis collects personal consumer data such as names and addresses social security numbers drivers license numbers cardholder data and payment history records such information is necessary to support our clients transaction processing and to conduct our check authorization and collection businesses the uninterrupted operation of information systems as well as the confidentiality of the customerconsumer information that resides on such systems is critical to the successful operation of fis for that reason cybersecurity is one of the principal operational risks fis faces as a provider of services to financial institutions if fis fails to maintain an adequate security infrastructure adapt to emerging security threats or implement sufficient security standards and technology to protect against security breaches the confidentiality of the information fis secures could be compromised unauthorized access to the computer systems or databases of fis could result in the theft or publication of confidential information the deletion or modification of records damages from legal actions from clients andor their customers or otherwise cause interruptions in fis operations and damage to its reputation these risks are greater with increased information transmission over the internet the increasing level of sophistication posed by cyber criminals nation statesponsored cyber attacks and the integration of fis systems with those of acquired companies such as worldpay 

as a provider of services to financial institutions and a provider of card processing services fis is bound by the same limitations on disclosure of the information fis receives from clients as apply to the clients themselves if fis fails to comply with these regulations and industry security requirements it could be exposed to damages from legal actions from clients andor their customers governmental proceedings governmental notice requirements and the imposition of significant fines or prohibitions on card processing services in addition if more restrictive privacy laws rules or industry security requirements are adopted in the future on the federal or state level or by a specific industry body they could have an adverse impact on fis through increased costs or restrictions on business processes 

any inability to prevent security or privacy breaches or the perception that such breaches may occur could cause existing clients to lose confidence in fis systems and terminate their agreements with fis inhibit fis ability to attract new clients result in increasing regulation or bring about other adverse consequences from the government agencies that regulate fis 

entity mergers or consolidations and business failures in the banking and financial services industry could adversely affect our business by eliminating some of our existing and potential clients and making us more dependent on a more limited number of clients 

there has been and continues to be substantial consolidation activity in the banking and financial services industry in addition certain financial institutions that experienced negative operating results including some of our clients have failed these consolidations and failures reduce our number of potential clients and may reduce our number of existing clients which could adversely affect our revenue even if the events do not reduce the aggregate activities of the consolidated entities further if our clients or our partners across any of our businesses fail andor merge with or are acquired by other entities that are not our clients or our partners or that use fewer of our services they may discontinue or reduce use of our services it is also possible that larger financial institutions resulting from consolidations would have greater leverage in negotiating terms or could decide to perform inhouse some or all of the services we currently provide or could provide any of these developments could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

if we fail to innovate or adapt our services to changes in technology or in the marketplace or if our ongoing efforts to upgrade or implement our technology are not successful we could lose clients or our clients could lose customers and we could have difficulty attracting new clients for our services 

the markets for our services are characterized by constant technological changes frequent introductions of new services and evolving industry standards our future success will be significantly affected by our ability to enhance our current solutions and develop and introduce new solutions and services that address the increasingly sophisticated needs of our clients and their customers in addition as more of our revenue and market demand shifts to software as a service saas business process as a service bpaas cloud and new emerging technologies the need to keep pace with rapid technology changes becomes more acute these initiatives carry the risks associated with any new solution development effort including cost overruns delays in delivery and implementation and performance issues there can be no assurance that we will be successful in developing marketing and selling new solutions or enhancements that meet these changing demands any of these developments could have an adverse impact on our future revenue andor business prospects 

we operate in a competitive business environment if we are unable to compete effectively our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 

the market for our services is intensely competitive our competitors in banking and capital markets vary in size and in the scope and breadth of the solutions and services they offer some of our competitors have substantial resources we face direct competition from third parties and because many of our larger potential clients have historically developed their key applications inhouse and therefore view their system requirements from a makeversusbuy perspective we also often compete against our potential clients inhouse capacities in addition the markets in which we compete have recently attracted increasing competition from smaller startups with emerging technologies which are receiving increasing investments global banks and businesses controlled by combinations of global banks and global internet companies that are introducing competitive solutions and services into the marketplace particularly in the payments area emerging technologies and increased competition may also have the effect of unbundling bank solutions and result in displacing solutions we are currently providing from our legacy systems international competitors are also now targeting and entering the us market with greater force there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors or that the competitive pressures we face in the markets in which we operate will not materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

in the merchant business our competitors include financial institutions and wellestablished payment processing companies in this business our us competitors that are financial institutions or are affiliated with financial institutions may not incur the sponsorship costs we incur for registration with the payment networks accordingly these competitors may be able to offer more attractive fees to our current and prospective clients or other services that we do not provide competition could result in a loss of existing clients and greater difficulty attracting new clients furthermore if competition causes us to reduce the fees we charge in order to attract or retain clients there is no assurance we can successfully control our costs in order to maintain our profit margins one or more of these factors could have a material adverse effect on fis business financial condition and results of operations 

fis is currently facing new competitive pressure from nontraditional payment processors and other parties entering the payments industry which may compete in one or more of the functions performed in processing merchant transactions these competitors have significant financial resources and robust networks and are highly regarded by consumers if these competitors gain a greater share of total electronic payments transactions or if we are unable to successfully react to changes in 

the industry spurred by the entry of these new market participants then it could have a material adverse effect on fis business financial condition and results of operations see item 1 business competition 

global economic political and other conditions including business cycles and consumer confidence may adversely affect our clients or trends in consumer spending which may adversely impact the demand for our services and our revenue and profitability 

a significant portion of our revenue is derived from transaction processing fees the global transaction processing industries depend heavily upon the overall level of consumer business and government spending any change in economic factors including a sustained deterioration in general economic conditions or consumer confidence particularly in the us or increases in interest rates in key countries in which we operate may adversely affect consumer spending consumer debt levels and credit and debit card usage and as a result adversely affect our financial performance by reducing the number or average purchase amount of transactions that we service 

when there is a slowdown or downturn in the economy a drop in stock market levels or trading volumes or an event that disrupts the financial markets our business and financial results particularly with respect to our capital markets segment may suffer for a number of reasons customers may react to worsening conditions by reducing their capital expenditures in general or by specifically reducing their information technology spending in addition customers may curtail or discontinue trading operations delay or cancel information technology projects or seek to lower their costs by renegotiating vendor contracts moreover competitors may respond to market conditions by lowering prices and attempting to lure away our customers to lower cost solutions any further protective trade policies or actions taken by the us may also result in other countries reducing or making more expensive services permitted to be provided by usbased companies if any of these circumstances remain in effect for an extended period of time there could be a material adverse effect on our financial results 

our results may fluctuate from period to period because of the lengthy and unpredictable sales cycle for our software changes in our mix of licenses and services activity by competitors and customer budgeting operational requirements or renewal cycles 

particularly with respect to our capital markets segment our operating results may fluctuate from period to period and be difficult to predict in a particular period due to the timing and magnitude of software license sales and other factors we offer a number of our software solutions on a license basis which means that the customer has the right to run the software on its own or a third partys hardware we generally recognize license revenue when the license contract is signed the software is delivered and the term has begun the value of the license often depends on a number of customerspecific factors such as the number of customer locations users or accounts the sales cycle for a software license may be lengthy and take unexpected turns thus it is difficult to predict when software sales will occur or how much revenue they will generate because there are few incremental costs associated with software sales our operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year due to the timing and magnitude of software sales conversion of clients from licenses to bpaas solutions while resulting in longerterm contracts may result in uneven shortterm results as onetime license fees are replaced by recurring revenue our results may also vary as a result of pricing pressures increased cost of equipment the evolving and unpredictable markets in which our solutions and services are sold changes in accounting principles and competitors new solutions or services 

failure to obtain new clients or renew client contracts on favorable terms could adversely affect results of operations and financial condition 

we may face pricing pressure in obtaining and retaining our clients larger clients in particular may use their value and negotiating leverage to seek price reductions from us when they renew a contract when a contract is extended or when the clients business has significant volume changes larger clients may also reduce services if they decide to move services inhouse further our smaller and midsize clients may also exert pricing pressure particularly upon renewal due to competition or other economic needs or pressures being experienced by the client on some occasions this pricing pressure results in lower revenue from a client than we had anticipated based on our previous agreement with that client this reduction in revenue could adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

our business and operating results could be adversely affected if we experience business interruptions errors or failure in connection with our or thirdparty information technology and communication systems and other software and hardware used in connection with our business if we experience defects or design errors in the software solutions we offer or more generally if the thirdparty vendors we rely upon are unwilling or unable to provide the services we need to effectively operate our business 

many of our services are based on sophisticated software and computing systems and we may encounter delays when developing new technology solutions and services further the technology solutions underlying our services have occasionally contained and may in the future contain undetected errors or defects when first introduced or when new versions are released in addition we may experience difficulties in installing or integrating our technologies on platforms used by our clients or our clients may cancel a project after we have expended significant effort and resources to complete an installation finally our systems and operations could be exposed to damage or interruption from fire natural disaster power loss telecommunications failure unauthorized entry and computer viruses defects in our technology solutions errors or delays in the processing of electronic transactions or other difficulties could result in i interruption of business operations ii delay in market acceptance iii additional development and remediation costs iv diversion of technical and other resources v loss of clients vi negative publicity or vii exposure to liability claims any one or more of the foregoing could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations although we attempt to limit our potential liability through controls including system redundancies security controls application development and testing controls and disclaimers and limitationofliability provisions in our license and client agreements we cannot be certain that these measures will always be successful in preventing disruption or limiting our liability 

further most of the solutions we offer are very complex software systems that are regularly updated no matter how careful the design and development complex software often contains errors and defects when first introduced and when major new updates or enhancements are released if errors or defects are discovered in current or future solutions then we may not be able to correct them in a timely manner if at all in our development of updates and enhancements to our software solutions we may make a major design error that makes the solution operate incorrectly or less efficiently the failure of software to properly perform could result in the company and its clients being subjected to losses or liability including censures fines or other sanctions by the applicable regulatory authorities and we could be liable to parties who are financially harmed by those errors in addition such errors could cause the company to lose revenue lose clients or damage its reputation 

our merchant business has made progress toward implementation of a new proprietary global acquiring platform project begun by worldpay as we continue to implement this project through the migration of existing merchant customers and onboarding of new merchant customers to the platform the scale and complexity associated with this project presents the increased potential for service level delays or disruptions in the processing of transactions telecommunications failures or other difficulties such delays or disruptions could result in reputational harm loss of business and increased operational or technological costs 

in addition we generally depend on a number of third parties both in the united states and internationally to supply elements of our systems computers research and market data connectivity communication network infrastructure other equipment and related support and maintenance we cannot be certain that any of these third parties will be able to continue providing these services to effectively meet our evolving needs if our vendors or in certain cases vendors of our customers fail to meet their obligations provide poor or untimely service or we are unable to make alternative arrangements for the provision of these services then we may in turn fail to provide our services or to meet our obligations to our customers and our business financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected 

  

federal state and foreign rules may result in business changes for certain of our businesses and clients these have had and further could have an adverse effect on our financial condition revenue results of operations or prospects for future growth and overall business 

the doddfrank act represented a comprehensive overhaul of the regulations governing the financial services industry within the us the doddfrank act established the cfpb and provided the cfpb with rulemaking authority with respect to certain federal consumer protection statutes as well as examination and supervisory authority over consumer reporting agencies including chexsystems 

the cfpb continues to establish rules and regulations for regulating financial and nonfinancial institutions and providers to those institutions to ensure adequate protection of consumer privacy and to ensure consumers are not impacted by deceptive business practices these rules and regulations govern our clients or potential clients and also govern certain of our businesses these regulations have resulted and may further result in the need for fis to make capital investments to modify our solutions and services to facilitate our clients and potential clients compliance as well as to deploy additional processes or reporting to comply with these regulations the new biden administration in washington has projected that it may expand the reach of this agency in the future we may be subject to additional expense to ensure continued compliance with applicable laws and regulations and to investigate defend andor remedy actual or alleged violations further requirements of these regulations have resulted and could further result in changes in our business practices our clients business practices and those of other marketplace participants that may alter the delivery of services to consumers which have impacted and could further impact the demand for our software and services as well as alter the types or volume of transactions that we process on behalf of our 

clients as a result these requirements or proposed or future requirements could have an adverse impact on our financial condition revenue results of operations prospects for future growth and overall business 

the new york department of financial services has enacted rules that require covered financial institutions to establish and maintain cybersecurity programs these rules subject fis to additional regulation and require us to adopt additional business practices that could also require additional capital expenditures or impact our operating results changes to state money transmission laws and regulations including changing interpretations and the implementation of new or varying regulatory requirements may result in the need for additional money transmitter licenses these changes could result in increased costs of compliance as well as fines or penalties 

one of our subsidiaries is an sec registered brokerdealer in the us and is subject to the financial and operational rules of finra and others are authorized by the fca to conduct certain regulated business in the uk domestic and foreign regulatory and selfregulatory organizations such as the sec finra and the fca can among other things fine censure issue ceaseanddesist orders against and suspend or expel a brokerdealer or its officers or employees for failure to comply with the many laws and regulations that govern brokerage activities regulations affecting the brokerage industry may change which could adversely affect our financial results 

we are exposed to certain risks relating to the execution services provided by our brokerage operations to our customers and counterparties which include other brokerdealers active traders hedge funds asset managers and other institutional and noninstitutional clients these risks include but are not limited to customers or counterparties failing to pay for or deliver securities trading errors the inability or failure to settle trades and trade execution system failures as trading in the us securities markets has become more automated the potential impact of a trading error or a rapid series of errors caused by a computer or human error or a malicious act has become greater in our other businesses we generally can disclaim liability for trading losses that may be caused by our software but in our brokerage operations we may not be able to limit our liability for trading losses or failed trades even when we are not at fault as a result we may suffer losses that are disproportionately large compared to the relatively modest profit contributions of our brokerage operations 

moreover the legislative and regulatory landscape for financial crimes compliance continues to evolve and any failure to comply with such laws could expose us to liability andor reputational damage financial crimes laws may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to country and impose inconsistent or conflicting requirements complying with varying jurisdictional requirements could increase the costs and complexity of compliance and associated recordkeeping costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business 

the company is subject to regulation supervision and enforcement authority of numerous governmental and regulatory bodies in the jurisdictions in which it operates 

because the company is a technology service provider to us financial institutions it is subject to regular oversight and examination by the federal banking agencies fba each of which is a member of the ffiec an interagency body of federal banking regulators the fba have broad discretion in the implementation interpretation and enforcement of banking and consumer protection laws and use the ffiecs uniform principles standards and report forms in their review of bank service providers like fis a failure to comply with these laws or a failure to meet the supervisory expectations of the banking regulators could result in adverse action against the company the regulators have the power to among other things enjoin unsafe or unsound practices require affirmative actions to correct any violation or practice issue administrative orders that can be judicially enforced direct the sale of subsidiaries or other assets and assess civil money penalties 

the company is also subject to ongoing supervision by regulatory and governmental bodies across the world including economic and conduct regulators such as the fca and psr in the uk the dnb in the netherlands and regulatory and governmental bodies responsible for issuing antimoney laundering antibribery and global economic sanctions regulations these various regulatory regimes require compliance across many aspects of our merchant activities in respect of capital requirements safeguarding training authorization and supervision of personnel systems processes and documentation we also have business operations that store process or transmit consumer information or have direct relationships with consumers that are obligated to comply with regulations including but not limited to the fcra the federal fair debt collection practices act and applicable privacy requirements in addition our wealth and retirement business holds a charter in the state of georgia which exposes us to further regulatory compliance requirements of the georgia department of banking and finance the us wealth and retirement business is required to hold certain levels of regulatory capital as defined by the state banking regulator in georgia  in the uk our merchant business as well as our platform securities and brokerdealer businesses are regulated by t he fca and are also subject to further regulatory capital requireme nts 

if we fail to comply with relevant regulations then we risk reputational damage potential civil and criminal sanctions fines or other action imposed by regulatory or governmental authorities including the potential suspension or revocation of the permissionbased regulatory licenses which authorize the company to provide core services to customers we are also involved from time to time in regulatory investigations reviews and proceedings both formal and informal by regulatory authorities regarding our businesses certain of which may result in adverse settlements fines penalties injunctions or other relief this could result in an adverse effect on fis business reputation and customer relationships which in turn could adversely affect its financial position and performance 

many of our clients are subject to a regulatory environment and to industry standards that may change in a manner that reduces the types or volume of solutions or services we provide or may reduce the type or number of transactions in which our clients engage and therefore reduce our revenue 

our clients are subject to a number of government regulations and industry standards with which our services must comply our clients must ensure that our services and related solutions work within the extensive and evolving regulatory and industry requirements applicable to them federal state foreign or industry authorities could adopt laws rules or regulations affecting our clients businesses that could lead to increased operating costs and could reduce the convenience and functionality of our services possibly resulting in reduced market acceptance in addition action by regulatory authorities relating to credit availability data usage privacy or other related regulatory developments could have an adverse effect on our clients and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition revenue results of operations prospects for future growth and overall business elimination of regulatory requirements could also adversely affect the sales of our solutions designed to help clients comply with complex regulatory environments 

our revenue relating to all aspects of the sale of services to members of visa mastercard and other payment networks is dependent upon our continued certification and sponsorship and the loss or suspension of certification or sponsorship could adversely affect our business 

in order to provide our card processing services we must be certified including applicable sponsorship by visa mastercard american express discover and other similar organizations these certifications are dependent upon our continued adherence to the standards of the issuing bodies and sponsoring member banks the member financial institutions some of which are our competitors set the standards with which we must comply if we fail to comply with these standards we could be fined our certifications could be suspended or our registration could be terminated the suspension or termination of our certifications or any changes in or the enforcement of the rules and regulations governing or relating to the businesses of visa mastercard or other payment networks could result in a reduction in revenue or increased costs of operation for us which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business 

in order to provide merchant transaction processing services in the us and certain other jurisdictions we are registered through our bank sponsorships with the visa mastercard and other payment networks as service providers for member institutions as a result fis and many of its clients are subject to payment network rules if fis or its associated participants do not comply with the payment network requirements the payment networks could seek to fine fis suspend fis or terminate its registrations our merchant business has occasionally received notices of noncompliance and fines which have typically related to excessive chargebacks by a merchant or data security failures on the part of a merchant if fis is unable to recover fines from or pass through costs to its merchants or other associated participants then fis would experience a financial loss the termination of its registration or any changes in the payment network rules that would impair fis registrations could require the company to stop providing payment network services to the visa mastercard or other payment networks which would have a material adverse effect on fis business financial condition and results of operations 

outside of the us our merchant business primarily provides acquiring and processing services directly through international credit and debit card networks run by visa mastercard and other payment networks in order to access the card networks the company must maintain the relevant jurisdictional operating licenses or memberships in some markets where it is not feasible or possible for the company to have a direct acquiring license with a card network we have a relationship with a local financial institution sponsor as part of the companys registration with card networks either directly or indirectly through local sponsors the company is subject to operating rules including mandatory technology requirements promulgated by the card networks that could subject the company and its customers to a variety of fines and penalties as well as suspension and termination of membership or access 

these agreements in the us and elsewhere with bank sponsors give such sponsors substantial discretion in approving certain aspects of our business practices in our merchant business including our solicitation application and qualification procedures for merchants and the terms of our agreements with merchants our financial institution sponsors discretionary actions under these agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of 

operations we also rely on various financial institutions to provide clearing services in connection with our settlement activities without these sponsorships or clearing services agreements in our merchant business we would not be able to process visa mastercard and other payment network transactions or settle transactions in relevant markets including the us which would have a material adverse effect on fis business financial condition and results of operations furthermore fis financial results could be adversely affected if the costs associated with such sponsorships or clearing services agreements increase 

changes in the contracts rules or standards of networks or relevant legal or regulatory scrutiny of pricing practices could adversely affect fis business financial condition and results of operations 

from time to time card and debit networks increase the interchange fees that they charge at their sole discretion our financial institution sponsors have the right to pass any increases in interchange and other fees on to us and they have consistently done so in the past while we are generally permitted under the contracts with our merchants to pass these fee increases along to our merchants through corresponding increases in our processing fees if we cannot continue to do so due to contractual or regulatory requirements or competitive pressures the inability to pass through such fees could have a material adverse effect on fis business financial condition and results of operations additionally in order to access the card networks directly as our merchant business does primarily outside the us we must pay card network membership fees which are subject to change from time to time and which we may be unable to pass along to our merchant clients potentially resulting in fis absorbing a portion or all of such increases in the future 

furthermore the rules and regulations of the various card associations and networks prescribe certain capital requirements any increase in the capital level required would further limit our use of capital for other purposes moreover as payment networks become more dependent on proprietary technology modify their technological approach or operating practices andor seek to provide value added services to issuers and merchants there is heightened risk that rules and standards may be governed by their own selfinterest or the selfinterest of third parties with influence over them which could materially impact fis competitive position and operations 

interchange fees and pricing practices have been receiving significant legal and regulatory scrutiny worldwide the resulting changes that could occur from proposed regulations or other forms of enforcement could alter the fees charged by us card associations and debit networks worldwide such changes could have an adverse impact on our business or financial condition and results of operations 

privacy laws and regulations have required and will further require fis to adopt new business practices and contractual provisions in existing and new contracts which may require transitional and incremental expenses which may impact our future operating results 

new privacy laws such as the gdpr in the eu continue to develop in unpredictable ways the company is also subject to the california consumer privacy act and the brazilian general personal data protection act failure to comply with these new laws could result in significant penalties damage to our brand and loss of business the company has incurred and will continue to incur costs to comply with these new laws there are also several additional privacy laws being considered by state legislatures the federal legislature and countries around the world as a result a more substantial compliance effort with varying regimes in different jurisdictions is considered probable in the future which will increase the costs and complexities of the business moreover privacy laws may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to country and impose inconsistent or conflicting requirements complying with varying jurisdictional requirements could increase the costs and complexity of compliance and associated recordkeeping costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business and incur additional costs data localization requirements in evolving data protection laws could also increase the cost and alter the approach to housing data around the world in addition our businesses are increasingly subject to laws and regulations relating to surveillance encryption and data onshoring in the jurisdictions in which we operate compliance with these laws and regulations may require us to change our technology for information security operational infrastructure policies and procedures which could be timeconsuming and costly 

high profile payment card industry or digital banking security breaches could impact consumer payment behavior patterns in the future and reduce our card payment transaction volumes 

we are unable to predict whether or when high profile card payment or digital banking security breaches will occur and if they occur whether consumers will transact less on their payment cards or reduce their digital banking service if consumers transact less on cards issued by our clients or reduce digital banking services and we are not able to adapt to offer our clients alternative technologies then our revenue and related earnings could be adversely affected 

misappropriation of our intellectual property and proprietary rights or a finding that our patents are invalid could impair our competitive position 

our ability to compete depends in some part upon our proprietary solutions and technology despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our services or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary or challenge the validity of our patents with governmental authorities policing unauthorized use of our proprietary rights is difficult we cannot make any assurances that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of technology or that the agreements entered into for that purpose will be enforceable effective patent trademark service mark copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our applications and services are made available online misappropriation of our intellectual property or potential litigation concerning such matters could have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition as we increase our international business we are subject to further risks of misappropriation of our intellectual property risks in countries which have laws which are less protective of intellectual property or are enforced in a less protective manner 

if our applications or services are found to infringe the proprietary rights of others then we may be required to change our business practices and may also become subject to significant costs and monetary penalties 

as our information technology applications and services develop we are increasingly subject to infringement claims any claims whether with or without merit could i be expensive and timeconsuming to defend ii result in an injunction or other equitable relief which could cause us to cease making licensing or using applications that incorporate the challenged intellectual property iii require us to redesign our applications if feasible iv divert managements attention and resources and v require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements in order to obtain the right to use necessary technologies or pay damages resulting from any infringing use 

some of our solutions contain open source software and any failure to comply with the terms of one or more of these open source licenses could adversely affect our business 

we use a limited amount of software licensed by its authors or other third parties under socalled open source licenses and may continue to use such software in the future some of these licenses contain requirements that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the open source software and that we license such modifications or derivative works under the terms of a particular open source license or other license granting third parties certain rights of further use by the terms of certain open source licenses we could be required to release the source code of our proprietary software if we combine our proprietary software with open source software in a certain manner additionally the terms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by us or other courts and there is a risk that these licenses could be construed in a manner that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our solutions in addition to risks related to license requirements usage of open source software can lead to greater risks than use of thirdparty commercial software as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on origin of the software we have established processes to help alleviate these risks including a review process for screening requests from our development organizations for the use of open source but we cannot be sure that all open source is submitted for approval prior to use in our solutions in addition many of the risks associated with usage of open source cannot be eliminated and could if not properly addressed adversely affect our business 

lack of system integrity fraudulent payments credit quality and undetected errors related to funds settlement or the availability of clearing services could result in a financial loss 

we settle funds on behalf of financial institutions other businesses and consumers and receive funds from clients card issuers payment networks and consumers on a daily basis for a variety of transaction types transactions facilitated by us include debit card credit card electronic bill payment transactions banking payments and check clearing that supports consumers financial institutions and other businesses these payment activities rely upon the technology infrastructure that facilitates the verification of activity with counterparties the facilitation of the payment as well as the detection or prevention of fraudulent payments if our continuity of operations integrity of processing or ability to detect or prevent fraudulent payments were compromised this could result in a financial loss to us in addition we rely on various financial institutions to provide automated clearing house ach services in support of funds settlement for certain of our solutions if we are unable to obtain such ach services in the future that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations in addition we may issue credit to consumers financial institutions or other businesses as part of the funds settlement a default on this credit by a counterparty could result in a financial loss to us furthermore if one of our clients for which we facilitate settlement suffers a fraudulent event due to a deficiency in their controls we may suffer a financial loss if the client does not have sufficient capital to cover the loss 

fraud by merchants or others could have a material adverse effect on fis business financial condition and results of operations 

in our merchant business we face potential liability for fraudulent electronic payment transactions initiated by merchants third parties or other associated participants examples of merchant fraud include when a merchant or other party knowingly accepts payment by a stolen or counterfeit credit debit or prepaid card card number or other credentials records a false sales transaction utilizing a stolen or counterfeit card or credentials processes an invalid card or intentionally fails to deliver the merchandise or services sold in an otherwise valid transaction in the event a dispute between a cardholder and a merchant is not resolved in favor of the merchant the transaction is normally charged back to the merchant and the purchase price is credited or otherwise refunded to the cardholder and fis is required to collect from the merchant failure to effectively manage risk and prevent fraud or other criminal activity could increase fis chargebacks or other liability increases in chargebacks or other liabilities due to merchant failures or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on fis business financial condition and results of operations 

the uks exit from membership in the eu could cause disruption to and create uncertainty surrounding our business 

our merchant business has a significant amount of business in and services clients in the uk we also have other business and operations in the uk and the eu the uk left the eu brexit on january 31 2020 pursuant to the terms of a withdrawal agreement concluded between the uk government and the council of the eu the withdrawal agreement included a transition period until december 31 2020 during which time the uk followed the eus rules and regulations and remained in the single market and customs union while the future terms of the uk’s relationship with the eu were being negotiated that transition period has now ended on december 24 2020 the uk and the eu announced they had struck a new bilateral trade and cooperation deal governing the future relationship between the uk and the eu the trade and cooperation agreement which sets out the principles of the relationship between the eu and the uk following the end of the transition period the trade and cooperation agreement was formally approved by the 27 member states of the eu on december 29 2020 and was formally approved by the uk parliament on december 30 2020 as of the date of this annual report on form 10k the european commission has proposed to apply the trade and cooperation agreement on a provisional basis for a limited time until february 28 2021 by which time the trade and cooperation agreement must be approved by the european parliament 

the trade and cooperation agreement provides clarity in respect of the intended shape of the future relationship between the uk and the eu and some detailed matters of trade and cooperation however there remain unavoidable uncertainties related to brexit and although the potential impact of brexit on our business cannot be fully assessed until the new relationship between the uk and eu is developed and defined and the uk negotiates concludes and implements successor trading arrangements with other countries brexit is likely to result in ongoing political legal and economic uncertainty in the uk and wider european markets such uncertainty could cause volatility in currency exchange rates in interest rates and in eu uk or worldwide political regulatory economic or market conditions and could contribute to instability in political institutions regulatory agencies and financial markets and may cause clients to closely monitor their costs and reduce their spending on our solutions and services 

in particular the economies of the uk and eu member states and individual businesses operating in one or more of those jurisdictions may be adversely affected by the restrictions on the ability to provide crossborder services from the uk into the eu and vice versa the introduction of nontariff and in the future potentially tariff barriers customs checks andor duties changes in tax including withholding tax restrictions on the movements of employees and restrictions on the transfer of personal data in addition there are likely to be changes in the legal rights and obligations of commercial parties across all industries particularly in the services sector including financial services following the uks exit from the eu despite the trade and cooperation agreement any delays with the approval of the trade and cooperation agreement by the european parliament its potentially problematic provisions or its potentially uncertain interpretation could adversely and significantly affect european or worldwide economic or market conditions and may contribute to instability in global financial and foreign exchange markets and could lead to legal uncertainty and divergent national laws and regulations any of these effects of brexit and others which cannot be anticipated could adversely affect our business business opportunities financial condition cash flows and operating results 

our business is subject to the risks of international operations including movements in foreign currency exchange rates 

the international operations of fis represented approximately 24 of our total 2020 revenue and are largely conducted in currencies other than the us dollar including the british pound sterling euro brazilian real and indian rupee as a result of the worldpay acquisition fis has significantly expanded its international presence by offering merchant acquiring including ecommerce services outside of the us including in the uk and eu countries where worldpays principal nonus 

operations are currently located our business and financial results could be adversely affected due to a variety of factors including the following 

• changes in a specific country or regions political and cultural climate or economic condition including change in governmental regime 

• unexpected or unfavorable changes in foreign laws regulatory requirements and related interpretations 

• difficulty of effective enforcement of contractual provisions in local jurisdictions 

• inadequate intellectual property protection in foreign countries 

• tradeprotection measures import or export licensing requirements such as export administration regulations promulgated by the us department of commerce and fines penalties or suspension or revocation of export privileges 

• trade sanctions imposed by the us or other governments with jurisdictional authority over our business operations 

• the effects of applicable and potentially adverse foreign tax law changes 

• significant adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates 

• lesser enforcement of intellectual property laws and protections internationally 

• longer accounts receivable cycles 

• managing a geographically dispersed workforce 

• trade treaties tariffs or agreements that could adversely affect our ability to do business in affected countries and 

• compliance with the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa and the office of foreign assets control regulations particularly in emerging markets 

as we expand our international operations more of our clients may pay us in foreign currencies conducting business in currencies other than the us dollar subjects us to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates that can negatively impact our results period to period including relative to analyst estimates or guidance our primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to foreign currencies in europe including the uk brazil and parts of asia the us dollar value of our net investments in foreign operations the periodic conversion of foreigndenominated earnings to the us dollar our reporting currency and our results of operations and in some cases cash flows could be adversely affected in a material manner by movements in foreign currency exchange rates these risks could cause an adverse effect on the business financial position and results of operations of the company 

failure to comply with antibribery and anticorruption laws could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences 

we are subject to the fcpa the uk bribery act and other antibribery anticorruption and antimoney laundering laws in various countries around the world the fcpa the uk bribery act and similar applicable laws generally prohibit companies as well as their officers directors employees and thirdparty intermediaries business partners and agents from making improper payments or providing other improper things of value to government officials or other persons for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business abroad or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment the fcpa also requires that us public companies maintain books and records that fairly and accurately reflect transactions and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls 

we conduct business in many foreign countries including a number of countries with developing economies and many of our employees thirdparty intermediaries and agents in such countries may have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies state owned or affiliated entities and other third parties where we may be held liable if they take actions in violation of these laws even if we do not explicitly authorize them although our policies and procedures require compliance with these laws and are designed to facilitate compliance with these laws we do business in many countries all over the world and cannot assure that our employees contractors or agents somewhere in the world will not take actions in violation of applicable laws or our policies for which we may be ultimately held responsible 

in the event that we believe or have reason to believe that our employees contractors or agents have or may have violated such laws we may be required to investigate or to have outside counsel investigate the relevant facts and circumstances detecting investigating and resolving actual or alleged violations can be extensive and require a significant diversion of time resources and attention from senior management further we cannot assure that any such investigation will successfully uncover all relevant facts and circumstances any violation of the fcpa the uk bribery act or other applicable antibribery or anticorruption laws could result in whistleblower complaints adverse media coverage investigations loss of export privileges and criminal or civil sanctions penalties and fines any of which could adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

we have businesses in emerging markets that may experience significant economic volatility 

we have operations in emerging markets primarily in latin america india southeast asia the middle east and africa these emerging market economies tend to be more volatile than the more established markets we serve in north america and europe which could add volatility to our future revenue and earnings 

acts of war or terrorism international conflicts political instability natural disasters or widespread outbreak of an illness could negatively affect various aspects of our business including our workforce and our business partners make it more difficult and expensive to meet our obligations to our customers and result in reduced revenue from our customers 

our global operations are susceptible to global events including acts or threats of war or terrorism international conflicts political instability and natural disasters we are also susceptible to a widespread outbreak of an illness or other health issue such as the ongoing covid19 outbreak these events can spread to different locations across the globe and can have an adverse effect on the global economy reducing consumer and corporate spending upon which our revenue depends individual employees can become ill quarantined or otherwise unable to work andor travel due to health reasons or governmental restrictions some of our operations are in countries where the effects of a widespread illness could be magnified due to health care systems that are less welldeveloped than in the us the occurrence of any of these events including the potential future effects of the covid19 outbreak could have an adverse effect on our business results and financial condition 

failure to attract and retain skilled technical employees or senior management personnel could harm our ability to grow 

our future success depends upon our ability to attract and retain highlyskilled technical personnel because the development of our solutions and services requires knowledge of computer hardware operating system software system management software and application software our technical personnel must be proficient in a number of disciplines competition for such technical personnel is intense and our failure to hire and retain talented personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

our future growth will also require sales and marketing financial and administrative personnel to develop and support new solutions and services to enhance and support current solutions and services and to expand operational and financial systems there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain the necessary personnel to accomplish our growth strategies and we may experience constraints that could adversely affect our ability to satisfy client demand in a timely fashion 

our ability to maintain compliance with applicable laws rules and regulations and to manage and monitor the risks facing our business relies upon the ability to maintain skilled compliance security risk and audit professionals competition for such skill sets is intense and our failure to hire and retain talented personnel could have an adverse effect on our internal control environment and impact our operating results 

our senior management team has significant experience in the financial services industry and the loss of this leadership could have an adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition further the loss of this leadership may have an adverse impact on senior managements ability to provide effective oversight and strategic direction for all key functions within the company which could impact our future business operating results and financial condition 

we are the subject of various legal proceedings that could have an adverse effect on our revenue and profitability 

we are involved in various litigation matters in the ordinary course of business including in some instances classaction cases and patent infringement litigation if we are unsuccessful in our defense of litigation matters we may be forced to pay damages andor change our business practices any of which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

unfavorable resolution of tax contingencies or unfavorable future tax law changes could adversely affect our tax expense 

our tax returns and positions are subject to review and audit by federal state local and international taxing authorities an unfavorable outcome to a tax audit could result in higher tax expense and could negatively impact our effective tax rate financial position results of operations and cash flows in the current andor future periods unfavorable future tax law changes could result in negative impacts in addition taxlaw amendments in the us and other jurisdictions could significantly impact how us multinational corporations are taxed although we cannot predict whether or in what form such legislation will pass if enacted it could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results 

a material weakness in our internal controls could have a material adverse effect on us 

effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reasonable assurance with respect to our financial reports and to adequately mitigate risk of fraud if we cannot provide reasonable assurance with respect to our financial reports and adequately mitigate risk of fraud our reputation and operating results could be harmed internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations including the possibility of human error the circumvention or overriding of controls or fraud therefore even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements in addition projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

a material weakness is a deficiency or combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the companys annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting could adversely impact our ability to provide timely and accurate financial information if we are unable to report financial information timely and accurately or to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures we could adversely affect our business prospects 

risks related to business combinations and ventures 

strategic transactions including acquisitions and divestitures involve significant risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

strategic acquisitions and divestitures we have made in the past and may make in the future present significant risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows these risks include the following

we have substantial goodwill and other intangible assets recorded as a result of acquisitions and a severe or extended economic downturn could cause these assets to become impaired requiring writedowns that would reduce our operating income 

as of december 31 2020 goodwill aggregated to 533 billion or 64 of total assets and intangible assets with finite useful lives aggregated to 139 billion or 17 of total assets current accounting rules require goodwill to be assessed for 

impairment at least annually or whenever changes in circumstances indicate potential impairment and require intangible assets with finite useful lives to be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable factors that may be considered a change in circumstance include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results a significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization and negative industry or economic trends we recorded 94 million in goodwill impairment related to certain nonstrategic businesses in the corporate and other segment during the fourth quarter of 2020 no other impairment was identified during the year ended december 31 2020 for goodwill and other intangible assets if worldwide or us economic conditions decline significantly with negative impacts to bank spending and consumer behavior or if other business or market changes impact our outlook then the carrying amount of our goodwill and other intangible assets may no longer be recoverable and we may be required to record an impairment charge which would have a negative impact on our results of operations we will continue to monitor the fair value of our goodwill and other intangible assets as well as our market capitalization and the impact of any economic downturn on our business to determine if there is an impairment in future periods 

  

risks related to our indebtedness 

our existing debt levels and future levels under existing facilities and debt service requirements may adversely affect fis including our financial condition or business flexibility and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our outstanding indebtedness 

as of december 31 2020 we had total debt of approximately 200 billion this level of debt or any increase in our debt level could adversely affect our business financial condition operating results and operational flexibility including the following i the debt level may cause us to have difficulty borrowing money in the future for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions or other purposes ii our debt level may limit operational flexibility and our ability to pursue business opportunities and implement certain business strategies iii some of our debt has a variable rate of interest which exposes us to the risk of increased interest rates iv we have a higher level of debt than some of our competitors or potential competitors which may cause a competitive disadvantage and may reduce flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions including increased competition and vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  v there are significant maturities on our debt that we may not be able to repay at maturity or that may be refinanced at higher rates and vi if we fail to satisfy our obligations under our outstanding debt or fail to comply with the financial or other restrictive covenants contained in the indenture governing our senior notes or our credit facility an event of default could result that could cause all of our debt to become due and payable 

we may be adversely affected by changes in libor reporting practices or the method in which libor is determined 

as of december 31 2020 we had outstanding approximately 251 million of borrowings under our revolving credit facility an interest rate swap with a 10 billion notional amount designated as a fair value hedge and a crosscurrency interest rate swap with a 206 million notional amount designated as a net investment hedge that are indexed to the london interbank offered rate libor on july 27 2017 the fca announced its intention to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for calibration of libor to the administrator of libor after 2021 on november 30 2020 the ice benchmark administration limited announced its plan to extend the date that most us libor values would cease being computed from december 31 2021 to june 30 2023 it is not possible to predict the further effect of the rules or policies of the fca any changes in the methods by which libor is determined or any other reforms to libor that may be enacted in the uk the eu or elsewhere any such developments may cause libor to perform differently than in the past or cease to exist in addition any other legal or regulatory changes made by the fca ice benchmark administration limited the european money markets institute formerly euriborebf the european commission or any other successor governance or oversight body or future changes adopted by such body in the method by which libor is determined or the transition from libor to a successor benchmark rate may result in among other things a sudden or prolonged increase or decrease in libor a delay in the publication of libor and changes in the rules or methodologies in libor which may discourage market participants from continuing to administer or to participate in libors determination and in certain situations could result in libor no longer being determined and published if a published us dollar libor rate is unavailable after 2021 the interest rates on our debt which is indexed to libor will be determined using various alternative methods any of which may result in interest obligations which are more than or do not otherwise correlate over time with the payments that would have been made on such debt if us dollar libor were available in its current form further the same costs and risks that may lead to the discontinuation or unavailability of us dollar libor may make one or more of the alternative methods impossible or impracticable to determine any of these proposals or consequences could have a material adverse effect on our financing costs 

our euro and gbpdenominated indebtedness has increased in recent years accordingly we have increased exposure to fluctuations in the eurousd and gbpusd exchange rates which could negatively affect our cost to service or refinance our euro and gbpdenominated debt securities 

in recent years our indebtedness denominated in euro or gbp has significantly increased as a result of our issuance of senior notes of varying maturities and our issuance of eurodenominated commercial paper at december 31 2020 the company had outstanding approximately €78 billion aggregate principal amount of eurodenominated senior notes approximately €702 million aggregate principal amount of eurodenominated commercial paper and approximately £19 billion aggregate principal amount of gbpdenominated senior notes or the combined equivalent of approximately 129 billion aggregate principal amount 

following the acquisition of worldpay we have increased our revenue and cash flows denominated in euro and gbp although we currently have substantial available cash flows in excess of the projected debt service requirements on our existing euro and gbpdenominated debt we cannot assure that we will be always be able to continue generating earnings in euros and gbp in amounts sufficient taking into account the funding requirements and other needs of our business to make payments of interest andor repayment of principal on our euro and gbp senior debt or to permit us to economically borrow in those currencies if needed to refinance our existing euro and gbp debt if our cash flows in euros or gbp are insufficient for such purposes we may need to exchange us dollars or funds in other currencies to make such payments which could result in increased costs to us in the event of adverse changes in currency exchange rates we have utilized and expect to continue to utilize foreign currency forward contracts and other hedges on a limited basis in an effort to mitigate currency risk but we cannot assure that such hedging arrangements will be effective or will remain available to us on acceptable terms or at all in addition we cannot predict economic and market conditions including prevailing interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates at the applicable times when our various series of euro and gbp senior debt are scheduled to mature nor can there be any assurance that we would be able to refinance any series of our euro and gbp senior debt in those currencies on acceptable terms at any such time all of which could have an adverse financial impact on us 

rising interest rates could increase our borrowing costs 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our shortterm commercial paper borrowings revolving credit facility and interest rate derivatives in the future we may have additional borrowings under existing or new variablerate debt increases in interest rates on variablerate debt would increase our interest expense a rising interest rate environment could increase the cost of refinancing existing debt and incurring new debt which could have an adverse effect on our financing costs 

credit ratings if lowered below investment grade would adversely affect our cost of funds and liquidity 

the company maintains investment grade credit ratings from the major us rating agencies on its senior unsecured debt sp bbb moodys baa2 fitch bbb as well as its commercial paper program sp a2 moodys p2 fitch f2 failure to maintain investment grade rating levels could adversely affect the companys cost of funds and liquidity and access to certain capital markets but would not have an adverse effect on the companys ability to access its existing revolving credit facility please note that a security rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities that it may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and that each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating

business trends and conditions 

our revenue is primarily derived from a combination of technology and processing services payment transaction fees professional services and software license fees while we are a global company and do business around the world the majority of our revenue is generated by clients in the us the majority of our international revenue is generated by clients in the uk germany australia canada brazil and india the majority of our revenue has historically been recurring and has been provided under multiyear banking and capital markets contracts that contribute relative stability to our revenue stream these services in general are considered critical to our clients operations although merchant has a lesser percentage of multiyear contracts substantially all of its revenue is recurring a considerable portion of our merchant recurring revenue and to a lesser extent a portion of our banking and capital markets recurring revenue is derived from transaction processing fees that fluctuate with the number or value of transactions processed among other variable measures associated with consumer commercial and capital markets activity professional services revenue is typically nonrecurring though recognition often occurs over time rather than at a point in time sales of software licenses are typically nonrecurring with pointintime recognition and are less predictable 

covid19 continued to impact our financial results in the fourth quarter of 2020 in certain locations where government lockdowns and shelterinplace orders have been tightened consumer spending impacting our merchant payments volume and related transaction revenue has been adversely impacted after partially recovering in the third quarter of 2020 certain discretionary spending verticals including travel airlines and restaurants continue to be significantly impacted the companys revenue continues to be impacted by reduced payment processing volumes within our merchant segment and to a lesser extent transaction volume within our banking segment 

we have seen some slowdown in customer decisionmaking on sales and implementation of our solutions as well as on software licenses and professional services these delays due largely to client caution have adversely affected our business results of operations and financial condition in the fourth quarter of 2020 and could continue although the magnitude and duration of their ultimate effect is not possible to predict and has not been material to date we have continued to prioritize investments in solutions that help address the needs of our clients in order to increase the companys potential to resume strong revenue growth following the pandemic 

in response to covid19 we are continuing to take several actions to manage discretionary expenses including reducing office space prohibiting most travel and reducing incentive compensation as well as accelerating automation and functional alignment across the organization these actions reduced such expenses by approximately 300 million in 2020 of this amount approximately 220 million relates to reduced incentive compensation for 2020 which we do not anticipate occurring with respect to 2021 incentive compensation 

our extension of higherthanusual levels of credit to our merchant clients as part of funds settlement in connection with payments to their customers for among other things refunds for cancelled trips and events lessened as the year progressed although increasing government lockdown orders in the fourth quarter could adversely impact credit extensions and chargebacks we are exposed to losses if our merchant customers are unable to repay the credit we have extended or to fund their liability for chargebacks due to closure insolvency bankruptcy or other reasons this increase in extended credit or potential liability for chargebacks did not have a material impact on our liquidity for the three and twelvemonth periods ended december 31 2020 although certain of our merchant clients have ceased doing business at least for a period of time and we continue to monitor their impact on our liquidity results of operations and financial condition 

we continue to assist financial institutions in migrating to outsourced integrated technology solutions to improve their profitability and address increasing and ongoing regulatory requirements as a provider of outsourcing solutions we benefit from multiyear recurring revenue streams which help moderate the effects of broader yeartoyear economic and market 

changes that otherwise might have a larger impact on our results of operations we believe our integrated solutions and outsourced services are wellpositioned to address this outsourcing trend across the markets we serve however delays in implementation of our solutions caused by the uncertainty of the covid19 pandemic may temporarily slow future revenue growth to an extent not yet determined 

over the last five years we have moved approximately 73 of our server compute primarily in north america to our fis cloud located in our strategic data centers and our goal is to increase that percentage to 80 by the end of 2021 this allows us to further enhance security for our clients data and increases the flexibility and speed with which we can provide solutions and services to our clients eventually at lesser cost concurrently we have continued to consolidate our data centers closing seven data centers in 2019 and an additional six data centers in 2020 our consolidation has generated a savings for the company as of yearend 2020 of approximately 240 million in runrate annual expense reduction since the programs inception in mid2016 we plan to close and consolidate approximately seven more data centers by the end of 2021 which should result in additional run rate annual expense reduction of approximately 10 million 

we continue to invest in modernization innovation and integrated solutions and services to meet the demands of the markets we serve and compete with global banks financial and other technology providers and emerging technology innovators we invest both organically and through investment opportunities in companies building complementary technologies in the financial services space our internal efforts in research and development activities have related primarily to the modernization of our proprietary core systems in each of our segments design and development of next generation digital and innovative solutions and development of processing systems and related software applications and risk management platforms we have increased our investments in these areas in each of the last three years our innovation efforts have recently resulted in bringing to market our modern banking platform that is among the first cloudnative core banking solutions we expect to continue our practice of investing an appropriate level of resources to maintain enhance and extend the functionality of our proprietary systems and existing software applications to develop new and innovative software applications and systems to address emerging technology trends in response to the needs of our clients and to enhance the capabilities of our outsourcing infrastructure 

we have invested in the development of new solutions by establishing the position of the chief growth officer in 2020 and building staff within that office this office prioritizes development and investment in new solutions in collaboration with our segment leaders including investment in fintech venture opportunities with innovative new solutions 

fis continues to carefully monitor the effects of the ongoing covid19 pandemic as conditions continue to evolve since the beginning of the pandemic the company has taken several actions to protect its employees while maintaining business continuity including implementing its comprehensive pandemic plan the pandemic plan includes sitespecific plans as well as travel restrictions medical response protocols workfromhome strategies and enhanced cleaning within our locations as a critical infrastructure provider for the global economy fis continues to operate around the world to serve our clients 

the spread of covid19 has caused us to modify our business practices including restricting employee travel developing social distancing plans for our employees and cancelling physical participation in meetings events and conferences and we may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or as we determine are in the best interests of our employees clients and business partners where government lockdowns have prohibited or slowed down certain functions at specific locations fis has outfitted employees to provide services from home or transferred work to other locations nearly 95 of our employees remain in a workfromhome status and have been effectively outfitted to continue to provide all necessary services to our clients we continued this workfromhome status in most locations since the impact of the pandemic began in midmarch 2020 through the end of the year as the safety of our employees is a top priority additionally for its employees the company has expanded sick leave for employees affected by covid19 expanded telemedicine internationally provided special pay for certain employees involved in critical infrastructure who could not work from home and expanded its fis cares program to benefit employees in need around the world 

consumer preference continues to shift from traditional branch banking services to digital banking solutions and our clients seek to provide a single integrated banking experience through their branch mobile internet and voice banking channels the covid19 pandemic appears to be accelerating digitization of banking and payment services by requiring in many cases banks and bank customers to transact through digital channels we have been providing our large regional banking customers in the us with digital one an integrated digital banking platfor m and are now adding functionality and offering digital one to our community bank clients to provide a consistent omnichannel experience for consumers of banking services across selfservice channels like mobile banking and online banking as well as supporting channels for bank staff operating in bank branches and contact centers the uniform customer experience extends to support a broad range of financial services including opening new accounts servicing of existing accounts money movement services and personal financial 

management as well as other consumer small business and commercial banking capabilities digital one is integrated into several of the core banking platforms offered by fis and is also offered to customers of nonfis core banking systems 

we anticipate consolidation within the banking industry will continue primarily in the form of merger and acquisition activity among financial institutions which we believe as a whole is detrimental to the profitability of the financial technology industry however consolidation resulting from specific merger and acquisition transactions may be beneficial to our business when consolidations of financial institutions occur merger partners often operate systems obtained from competing service providers the newly formed entity generally makes a determination to migrate its core and payments systems to a single platform when a financial institution processing client is involved in a consolidation we may benefit by their expanding the use of our services if such services are chosen to survive the consolidation and to support the newly combined entity conversely we may lose revenue if we are providing services to both entities or if a client of ours is involved in a consolidation and our services are not chosen to survive the consolidation and to support the newly combined entity it is also possible that larger financial institutions resulting from consolidation may have greater leverage in negotiating terms or could decide to perform inhouse some or all of the services that we currently provide or could provide we seek to mitigate the risks of consolidations by offering other competitive services to take advantage of specific opportunities at the surviving company 

as a result of the worldpay acquisition completed on july 31 2019 fis is now a global leader in the merchant solutions industry with differentiated solutions throughout the payments market including capabilities in global ecommerce integrated payments and enterprise payments and data security solutions in businesstobusiness b2b payments these solutions bring together advanced payments technologies at each stage of the transaction life cycle the worldpay acquisition broadened our solution portfolio enabling us to significantly expand our merchant acquiring solutions including our capabilities in the growing ecommerce and integrated payment segments of the market which are in demand among our merchant clients as they look for ways to integrate technology into their business models the combination also favorably impacts our business mix with a greater concentration in higher growth and higher margin services the worldpay acquisition significantly increased our revenue as well as our amortization expense for acquired intangibles and our acquisition integration and other costs however due to the covid19 pandemic our merchant processing revenue has been adversely impacted particularly in the discretionary spending areas of travel airlines and restaurants and we expect revenue will continue to be adversely impacted until the economic effects and government company and public travel restrictions due to the pandemic subside around the world 

following the worldpay acquisition we are focused on completing postmerger integration to achieve potential incremental revenue opportunities and expense efficiencies created by the combination of the two companies we have a history of successfully integrating the operations and technology platforms of acquired companies including winding down legacy environments and consolidating platforms from other acquisitions into our environment based on prior integration experience we developed integration plans to achieve the potential benefits created by the worldpay acquisition as of the end of 2020 our achievement of revenue synergies remains on track to meet or exceed our current targets driven by successful crosssell of our heritage premium payback solution into heritage worldpay clients and by leveraging our heritage worldpay sales and distribution teams expanding on our existing relationships with financial institutions to establish merchant referral agreements and optimizing our network routing capabilities we have also exceeded our original target for expense synergies as we have successfully integrated organizational structures reduced corporate overhead and achieved cost savings within our operating environment and expect to continue to achieve additional expense synergies during 2021 

we co ntinue to see demand for innovative solutions in the payments market that will deliver faster more convenient payment solutions in mobile channels internet applications and cards the payment processing industry is adopting new technologies developing new solutions and services evolving new business models and being affected by new market entrants and by an evolving regulatory environment as merchants and financial institutions respond to these changes by seeking services to help them enhance their own offerings to consumers including the ability to accept cardnotpresent cnp payments in ecommerce and mobile environments as well as contactless cards and mobile wallets at the pointofsale fis believes that payment processors will seek to develop additional capabilities in order to serve clients evolving needs to facilitate this expansion we believe that payment processors will need to enhance their technology platforms so they can deliver these capabilities and differentiate their offerings from other providers the covid19 pandemic appears to be accelerating digitization of payment services by requiring in many cases businesses and consumers to transact through digital channels 

we believe that these market changes present both an opportunity and a risk for us and we cannot predict which emerging technologies or solutions will be successful however fis believes that payment processors like fis that have scalable integrated business models provide solutions across the payment processing value chain and utilize broad distribution capabilities will be best positioned to enable emerging alternative electronic payment technologies further fis believes that its depth of capabilities and breadth of distribution will enhance its position as emerging payment technologies are adopted by merchants and other businesses fis ability to partner with nonfinancial institution enterprises such as mobile payment 

providers and internet retail and social media companies could create attractive growth opportunities as these new entrants seek to become more active participants in the development of alternative electronic payment technologies and to facilitate the convergence of retail online mobile and social commerce applications 

globally attacks on information technology systems continue to grow in frequency complexity and sophistication this is a trend we expect to continue such attacks have become a point of focus for individuals businesses and governmental entities the objectives of these attacks include among other things gaining unauthorized access to systems to facilitate financial fraud disrupt operations cause denial of service events corrupt data and steal nonpublic information these circumstances present both a threat and an opportunity for fis as part of our business we electronically receive process store and transmit a wide range of confidential information including sensitive customer information and personal consumer data we also operate payment cash access and prepaid card systems 

fis remains focused on making strategic investments in information security to protect our clients and our information systems these investments include both capital expenditures and operating expense related to hardware software personnel and consulting services we also participate in industry and governmental initiatives to improve information security for our clients through the expertise we have gained with this ongoing focus and involvement we have developed fraud security risk management and compliance solutions to target this growth opportunity in the financial services industry 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the accounting policies described below are those we consider critical in preparing our consolidated financial statements these policies require management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures with respect to contingent liabilities and assets at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods actual amounts could differ from those estimates see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed description of the significant accounting policies that have been followed in preparing our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

the company generates revenue in a number of ways including from the delivery of account or transactionbased processing saas bpaas cloud offerings software licensing softwarerelated services and professional services our contracts frequently contain nonstandard terms that require judgment to determine the appropriate impact on revenue recognition we are frequently a party to multiple concurrent contracts with the same client these situations require judgment to determine whether the individual contracts should be combined or evaluated separately for purposes of revenue recognition in making this determination we consider the timing of negotiating and executing the contracts whether the different elements of the contracts are negotiated as a package with a single commercial objective whether the solutions or services promised in the contracts are a single performance obligation and whether any of the payment terms of the contracts are interrelated our individual contracts also frequently include multiple promised solutions or services at contract inception we assess the solutions and services promised in our contracts with customers and identify a performance obligation for each promise to transfer to the customer a solution or service or bundle of solutions or services that is distinct  ie if a solution or service is separately identifiable from other items in the bundled package and if a customer can benefit from it on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the customer we must apply judgment in these circumstances in determining whether individual promised solutions or services can be considered distinct or should instead be combined with other promised solutions or services in the contract we recognize revenue when or as we satisfy a performance obligation by transferring control of a solution or service to a customer we must use judgment to determine whether revenue is measured at a point in time or over time to determine when the customer obtains control for performance obligations satisfied at a point in time and to determine the appropriate measure of progress for performance obligations satisfied over time judgment is also required in estimating and allocating variable consideration to one or more but not all performance obligations in a contract determining the standalone selling prices of each performance obligation and allocating the transaction price to each distinct performance obligation in a contract 

due to the large number broad nature and average size of individual contracts we are party to the impact of judgments and assumptions that we apply in recognizing revenue for any single contract is not likely to have a material effect on our consolidated operations or financial position however the broader accounting policy assumptions that we apply across similar contracts or classes of clients could significantly influence the timing and amount of revenue recognized in our historical and future results of operations or financial position 

capitalized software development costs 

capitalized software development costs require judgment in determining when costs should be capitalized the appropriate period over which to amortize the capitalized costs and whether there is impairment of unamortized capitalized costs we capitalize software development costs when technological feasibility of the software has been established for software to be marketed or at the beginning of application development for internaluse software in determining useful lives for amortization we consider historical results and technological trends that may influence the estimate useful lives for capitalized software development costs typically range from three to 10 years 

the company assesses the recorded value of capitalized software development costs for impairment on a regular basis by comparing the carrying value to the estimated future cash flows to be generated by the underlying software asset net realizable value analysis for software to be marketed there are inherent uncertainties in determining the expected useful life or cash flows to be generated from capitalized software development costs for the year ended december 31 2019 we recorded 87 million in asset impairments primarily related to certain software to be marketed for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2018 respectively we have not had more than minimal charges for impairments of software while we have not historically experienced significant changes in these balances due to changes in estimates our results of operations could be subject to such changes in the future 

purchase accounting 

we allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction at their estimated fair values the estimates used to determine the fair value of longlived assets such as intangible assets and software are complex and require a significant amount of management judgment we typically engage thirdparty valuation specialists to assist us in making fair value determinations the thirdparty valuation specialists generally use discounted cash flow models which require internallydeveloped assumptions to determine the acquisition fair value of customer relationship intangible assets and developed technology software assets assumptions for customer relationship asset valuations typically include forecasted revenue attributable to existing customer contracts and relationships estimated annual attrition forecasted ebitda margin and estimated weighted average cost of capital and discount rates assumptions for software asset valuations typically include forecasted revenue attributable to the software assets obsolescence rates estimated royalty rates and estimated weighted average cost of capital and discount rates 

while we use our best estimates and assumptions to determine the fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement as a result during the measurement period which may be up to one year from the acquisition date we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed upon the conclusion of the measurement period any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of earnings 

we are also required to estimate the useful lives of intangible assets to determine the amount of acquisitionrelated intangible asset amortization expense to record in future periods the determination of asset lives affects our results of operations as different types of assets have different useful lives and certain assets may be considered to have indefinite useful lives we periodically review the estimated useful lives assigned to our finitelived intangible assets to determine whether such estimated useful lives continue to be appropriate 

see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of the virtus acquisition in 2020 and worldpay acquisition in 2019 we had no significant business combinations during 2018 

goodwill 

goodwill was 533 billion and 522 billion as of december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively the company assesses goodwill for impairment by reporting unit on an annual basis during the fourth quarter or more frequently if circumstances indicate potential impairment our reporting units are the same as our primary operating segments with additional reporting units for certain nonstrategic businesses within the corporate and other segment goodwill impairment assessments require a significant amount of management judgment and a meaningful change in one or more of the underlying forecasts estimates or assumptions used in testing goodwill for impairment could result in a material impact on the companys results of operations and financial position based on the results of our assessments for 2020 94 million of goodwill related to certain nonstrategic businesses within the corporate and other segment was impaired for all other reporting units for all periods presented goodwill was not impaired 

when performing a qualitative assessment we consider events and circumstances to determine if it is more likely than not that a reporting units carrying amount exceeds its fair value including factors such as macroeconomic conditions industry and 

market conditions cost factors overall financial performance events affecting the reporting unit or company as a whole including a sustained decrease in stock price we examine those factors most likely to affect each reporting units fair value 

when performing a quantitative assessment we typically engage thirdparty valuation specialists to assist us in determining the fair value of the reporting unit based on a weighted average of multiple valuation techniques typically a combination of an income approach and a market approach the income approach calculates a value based upon the present value of estimated future cash flows while the market approach uses earnings multiples of similarly situated guideline public companies the income approach involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions regarding forecasted revenue growth rates operating margins capital expenditures and other factors used to calculate estimated future cash flows in addition riskadjusted discount rates and future economic and market conditions and other assumptions are applied the market approach involves the selection of guideline public companies and earnings multiples considering factors such as markets of operation solutions offered and risk profiles 

for each of 2019 and 2018 we began our annual assessment with the qualitative assessment and concluded that it remained more likely than not that the fair value of each of our reporting units continued to exceed the carrying amounts for 2020 we began our annual assessment for the banking solutions and capital market solutions reporting units with qualitative assessments and concluded that that it remained more likely than not that the fair value of each of the reporting units continued to exceed their respective carrying amounts based on the qualitative assessment performed for these reporting units and because there was a substantial excess of fair value over carrying amount in our previous thirdparty valuations performed in 2015 for banking solutions and capital market solutionsrelated businesses we believe the likelihood of obtaining materially different results based on a change of assumptions is low 

for merchant solutions we began our 2020 annual assessment with a quantitative assessment due to the economic impact of the covid19 pandemic on our merchant solutions business and its primary operations being recently acquired as part of the worldpay acquisition as a result of the assessment the fair value of the reporting unit was estimated to be in excess of carrying amount by approximately 4 the fair value was determined with the assistance of thirdparty valuation specialists using an equal weighting of the income and market approaches based on an evaluation of the availability and relevance of guideline public companies having similar risks participating in similar markets and providing similar solutions for their customers 

for the income approach to estimating the fair value of the merchant solutions reporting unit we estimated future cash flows using internal forecasts which were developed considering historical operating performance expected economic conditions and industry and market trends including the impact of the covid19 global pandemic and expected impact of planned business initiatives at the end of the forecast period we used a longterm growth rate to determine the terminal value based on an evaluation of the minimum expected terminal growth rate of the merchant solutions reporting unit as well as broader economic considerations such as inflation and foreign exchange rates due to the inherent uncertainties involved in making estimates and assumptions actual results may differ from those determined based on our forecasts 

in computing the present value of estimated future cash flows we used a riskadjusted discount rate based on an assessment of the weighted average cost of capital calculation for the merchant solutions reporting unit and relevant guideline public companies we believe the discount rate used is commensurate with the risks and uncertainties inherent in the merchant solutions business and in our internally developed forecasts but the rate is subject to change in future periods based on changes in the us treasury rate inflation and other factors 

the estimated fair value of the merchant solutions reporting unit was derived from the valuation techniques described above incorporating forecasts and assumptions the estimated fair value of the merchant solutions reporting unit is sensitive to changes in these forecasts and assumptions and such changes could impact the determination of goodwill impairment we performed sensitivity analyses around certain assumptions in order to assess the reasonableness of the assumptions and the resulting estimated fair value for example a hypothetical 100basispoint increase in the discount rate yielded an estimated fair value for the merchant solutions reporting unit below its carrying amount 

given the results of the merchant solutions reporting unit quantitative assessment the reporting unit is at risk for future goodwill impairment as it is reasonably possible that among other factors future developments related to the economic impact of the covid19 pandemic on our merchant solutions business such as an extended duration of the pandemic andor governmentimposed shutdowns prolonged economic downturn or recession or lack of governmental support for recovery could have a material impact on one or more of the estimates and assumptions used to evaluate goodwill impairment and could result in future goodwill impairment

revenue 

revenue increased primarily due to incremental revenue from the worldpay acquisition revenue was adversely impacted by reduced payment processing volumes within our merchant solutions segment and to a lesser extent transaction volume within our banking solutions segment as a result of the covid19 pandemic see segment results of operations below for more detailed explanation 

cost of revenue gross profit and gross profit margin 

gross profit increased primarily due to the revenue variances noted above gross profit margin decreased primarily due to higher acquired intangible asset amortization expense partially offset by higher margin revenue from the worldpay acquisition 

selling general and administrative expenses 

selling general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to incremental worldpay corporate and infrastructure expenses and higher acquisition integration and other costs these increases were partially offset by lower discretionary spending during the covid19 pandemic 

asset impairments 

during 2020 the company recorded asset impairments totaling 136 million related to goodwill for certain nonstrategic businesses and to certain longlived assets related to reducing office space during 2019 the company recorded asset impairments totaling 87 million primarily related to certain software resulting from the companys net realizable value analysis 

operating income and operating margin 

the annual change in operating income resulted from the revenue and cost variances noted above the operating margin during 2020 was negatively impacted by higher acquired intangible asset amortization expense higher acquisition integration and other costs and asset impairments of 136 million the operating margin during 2019 was negatively impacted by higher acquired intangible asset amortization expense higher acquisition integration and other costs and asset impairments of 87 million 

total other income expense net 



the decrease in interest expense net is primarily due to a lower weighted average interest rate on the outstanding debt throughout the year notwithstanding the increase in outstanding debt as a result of the worldpay acquisition partially offset by a decrease in interest income as compared to the prior year that included interest income on the proceeds from the worldpay acquisitionrelated debt issuances prior to closing 

other income expense net for 2020 primarily represents the fair value adjustment on certain nonoperating assets and liabilities foreign currency transaction remeasurement gains an d losses and the pending settlement amount of the reliance trust claims which is further described in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements 

other income expense net for 2019 primarily includes a pretax charge of approximately 217 million in tender premiums and fees and the writeoff of previously capitalized debt issuance costs on the early redemption of approximately 30 billion in aggregate principal amount of our senior notes as well as approximately 33 million of acquisition financing costs related to the acquisition of worldpay these items were partially offset by the noncash foreign currency gain on nonhedged euro and pound sterlingdenominated notes issued to finance the worldpay acquisition during the period from the date of issue of the notes to the date of the acquisition 

provision benefit for income taxes 



the effective tax rate for the 2020 period includes a onetime net remeasurement of certain deferred tax liabilities due to the increase in the uk corporate statutory tax rate from 17 to 19 enacted on july 22 2020 the effective tax rate for 2019 includes a detriment of 44 million due to nondeductible executive stock compensation primarily driven by acceleration of converted heritage worldpay stock compensation awards and the accrual of additional stock compensation due to reaching certain worldpay synergy targets and a detriment of 21 million due to the postacquisition combined state income tax rates

liquidity and capital resources 

cash requirements 

our ongoing cash requirements include operating expenses income taxes tax receivable obligations mandatory debt service payments capital expenditures stockholder dividends regulatory requirements working capital and timing differences in settlementrelated assets and liabilities and may include discretionary debt repayments share repurchases and business acquisitions our principal sources of funds are cash generated by operations and borrowings including the capacity under our revolving credit facility the us commercial paper program and the eurocommercial paper program discussed in note 12 to the consolidated financial statements 

as of december 31 2020 the company had 4600 million of available liquidity including 1959 million of cash and cash equivalents and 2641 million of capacity available under its revolving credit facility approximately 1443 million of cash and cash equivalents is held by our foreign entities the majority of our cash and cash equivalents represents net depositsintransit at the balance sheet dates and relates to daily settlement activity and regulatory requirements debt outstanding totaled 200 billion with an effective weighted average interest rate of 17 

the companys liquidity continued to improve throughout the year as compared to the onset of the pandemic additionally the volume of consumer refunds continued to decline thereby reducing the higherthanusual levels of credit that were extended at the onset of the pandemic to our merchant clients as part of the funds settlement process our liquidity could be impacted if economic conditions deteriorate or as a result of governmental measures that might be imposed in response to the covid19 pandemic 

the company remains committed to reducing its leverage incurred in the worldpay acquisition while ensuring ample liquidity and expects to reach its target leverage in 2021 

we expect that cash and cash equivalents plus cash flows from operations over the next 12 months will be sufficient to fund our operating cash requirements capital expenditures and mandatory debt service payments 

we currently expect to continue to pay quarterly dividends however the amount declaration and payment of future dividends is at the discretion of our board of directors and depends on among other things our investment opportunities 

results of operations financial condition cash requirements future prospects the duration and impact of the covid19 pandemic and other factors that may be considered relevant by our board of directors including legal and contractual restrictions additionally the payment of cash dividends may be limited by covenants in certain debt agreements in january 2021 the board of directors approved a dividend increase of 11 to 039 per share per quarter beginning with the first quarter of 2021 a regular quarterly dividend of 039 per common share is payable on march 26 2021 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on march 12 2021 

the existing plan authorizing share repurchases approved by the board of directors in 2017 expired as of december 31 2020 management temporarily suspended share repurchases during 2020 as a result of the worldpay transaction to accelerate debt repayment in january 2021 our board of directors approved a new share repurchase program under which it authorized the company to repurchase up to 100 million shares of our common stock at managements discretion from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions and through rule 10b51 plans the new repurchase program has no expiration date and may be suspended for periods amended or discontinued at any time 

cash flows from operations 

cash flows from operations were 4442 million 2410 million and 1993 million in 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively our net cash provided by operating activities consists primarily of net earnings adjusted to add back depreciation and amortization cash flows from operations increased 2032 million in 2020 and 417 million in 2019 the 2020 increase in cash flows from operations is primarily due to increased cash flow from the worldpay operations including the timing of settlement activity partially offset by worldpay integrationrelated expenses and lower net earnings from the covid19 pandemic the 2019 increase in cash flows from operations is primarily due to increased cash flow due to the worldpay acquisition partially offset by the timing of working capital and worldpay acquisition transaction and integrationrelated expenses the 2018 period included us federal estimated income tax payments normally due in the third and fourth quarters of 2017 that were paid during the first quarter of 2018 due to the hurricane irma relief program

recent accounting guidance not yet adopted 

no other new accounting pronouncement issued or effective during the fiscal year had or is expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or disclosures 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risks 

market risk 

we are exposed to market risks primarily from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates such risks may be exacerbated by the effects of the covid19 pandemic we periodically use certain derivative financial instruments including interest rate swaps and foreign currency forward contracts to manage interest rate and foreign currency risk we do not use derivatives for trading purposes to generate income or to engage in speculative activity 

interest rate risk 

in addition to existing cash balances and cash provided by operating activities we use fixedrate and variablerate debt to finance our operations we are exposed to interest rate risk on these debt obligations and related interest rate swaps 

our fixedrate senior notes as included in note 12 to the consolidated financial statements represent the majority of our fixedrate longterm debt obligations as of december 31 2020 the carrying value excluding the fair value of the interest rate swaps described below and unamortized discounts of our senior notes was 170 billion as of december 31 2020 the fair value of our senior notes was approximately 186 billion as of december 31 2020 the potential reduction in fair value of the senior notes from a hypothetical 10 percent increase in market interest rates would not be material to the overall fair value of the debt 

our variablerate risk principally relates to borrowings under our us commercial paper program eurocommercial paper program revolving credit facility senior euro floating rate notes as included in note 12 to the consolidated financial statements and interest rate swaps on our fixedrate longterm debt at december 31 2020 our weighted average cost of debt was 17 with a weightedaverage maturity of 54 years 74 of our debt was fixedrate and the remaining 26 of our debt was variablerate a 100 basispoint increase in the weighted average interest rate on our variablerate debt would have increased our 2020 annual interest expense by 51 million we performed the foregoing sensitivity analysis based solely on the principal amount of our variablerate debt as of december 31 2020 this sensitivity analysis does not take into account any changes that occurred in the prior 12 months or that may take place in the next 12 months in the amount of our outstanding debt further this sensitivity analysis assumes the change in interest rates is applicable for an entire year for comparison purposes based on principal amounts of variablerate debt outstanding as of december 31 2019 and calculated in the same manner as set forth above an increase of 100 basis points in the weighted average interest rate would have increased our annual interest expense by approximately 45 million 

as of december 31 2020 the following interest rate swaps converting the interest rate exposure on our senior euro notes due july 2024 and our senior usd notes due may 2029 from fixed to variable are outstanding in millions 



1 0370 in effect as of december 31 2020 

2 3161 in effect as of december 31 2020 

by entering into the aforementioned swap agreements we have assumed risks associated with variable interest rates based upon libor changes in the overall level of interest rates affect the interest expense that we recognize we designated the interest rate swaps as fair value hedges for accounting purposes as described in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements a 100 basispoint increase in the 3month euribor rate and 3month libor rate would increase our annual interest expense on these swaps by approximately 6 million and 10 million respectively 

foreign currency risk 

we are exposed to foreign currency risks that arise from normal business operations these risks include the translation of local currency balances of foreign subsidiaries transaction gains and losses associated with intercompany loans with foreign subsidiaries and transactions denominated in currencies other than a locations functional currency we manage the exposure to these risks through a combination of normal operating activities and the use of foreign currency forward contracts and nonderivative and derivative investment hedges 

our exposure to foreign currency exchange risks generally arises from our nonus operations to the extent they are conducted in local currency changes in foreign currency exchange rates affect translations of revenue denominated in currencies other than the us dollar during the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 we generated approximately 2432 million 1852 million and 1542 million respectively in revenue denominated in currencies other than the us dollar the major currencies to which our revenue is exposed are the british pound sterling euro brazilian real and indian rupee a 10 movement in average exchange rates for these currencies assuming a simultaneous and immediate 10 change in all of such rates for the relevant period would have resulted in the following increase or decrease in our reported revenue for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 in millions 



while our results of operations have been impacted by the effects of currency fluctuations our international operations revenue and expenses are generally denominated in local currency which reduces our economic exposure to foreign exchange risk in those jurisdictions 

our foreign exchange risk management policy permits the use of derivative instruments such as forward contracts and options to reduce volatility in our results of operations andor cash flows resulting from foreign exchange rate fluctuations we do not enter into foreign currency derivative instruments for trading purposes or to engage in speculative activity we do periodically enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge foreign currency exposure to intercompany loans and other balance sheet items the company also utilizes foreign currencydenominated debt and crosscurrency interest rate swaps designated as net investment hedges in order to reduce the volatility of the net investment value of certain of its euro and pound sterling functional subsidiaries see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements

as part of our research and development process we evaluate current and emerging technology for compatibility with our existing and future software platforms to this end we engage with various hardware and software vendors in the evaluation of various infrastructure components where appropriate we use thirdparty technology components in the development of our software applications and service offerings in the case of nearly all of our thirdparty software enterprise license agreements exist for the thirdparty component and either alternative suppliers exist or transfer rights exist to ensure the continuity of supply as a result we are not materially dependent upon any thirdparty technology components thirdparty software may be used for highly specialized business functions which we may not be able to develop internally within time and budget constraints additionally thirdparty software may be used for commoditytype functions within a technology platform environment we work with our clients to determine the appropriate timing and approach to introducing technology or infrastructure changes to our applications and services during the years ended december 31 2019  2018 and 2017 we incurred research and development costs that were noncapitalizable of approximately 3 to 4 of revenue 

government regulation 

our services are subject to a broad range of complex federal state and international regulations and requirements as well as requirements under the rules of selfregulatory organizations including without limitation federal truthinlending and truthinsavings rules state money transmission laws state cybersecurity protection laws data protection and privacy laws usury laws laws governing state trust charters the equal credit opportunity act the electronic funds transfer act the fair credit reporting act the fair debt collection practices act the bank service company act the bank secrecy act the usa patriot act the internal revenue code the employee retirement income security act the health insurance portability and accountability act the community reinvestment act and the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the doddfrank act the securities exchange act of 1934 the investment advisors act of 1940 the 1940 act anticorruption laws including the us foreign corrupt practices act and uk bribery act the rules and regulations of the financial industry regulatory authority finra the securities and exchange commission sec the federal financial institutions examination council ffiec the consumer financial protection bureau cfpb the financial conduct authority in the uk fca and the payment systems regulator in the uk psr de nederlandsche bank dnb in the netherlands the ministry of economy trade and industry in japan meti and state financial services regulators including enforcement of state cybersecurity laws the compliance of our services and applications with these and other applicable laws and regulations depends on a variety of factors including the manner in which our clients use them in some cases we are directly subject to regulatory oversight and examination in other cases our clients are contractually responsible for determining what is required of them under applicable laws and regulations and utilize our products and services to achieve compliance with those laws and regulations in either case the failure of our services to comply with applicable laws and 

regulations may result in suspension or revocation of the permissionbased regulatory licenses andor restrictions on our ability to provide those services andor the imposition of civil fines andor criminal penalties andor reputational damage further regulatory authorities have the power to among other things enjoin unsafe or unsound practices require affirmative actions to correct any violation or practice issue administrative orders that can be judicially enforced and direct the sale of subsidiaries or other assets we may be adversely affected by increased regulatory scrutiny or related negative publicity 

the principal areas of regulation impacting our business are the following 

 

our usbased wealth and retirement business holds a charter in the state of georgia which makes us subject to the regulatory compliance requirements of the georgia department of banking and finance as a result we are also authorized to provide trust services in various additional states subject to additional applicable state regulations 

 

our subsidiaries also include an secregistered transfer agent our registered transfer agent is subject to the securities exchange act of 1934 and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder these laws and regulations generally grant the sec and other supervisory bodies broad administrative powers to address noncompliance with regulatory requirements sanctions that may be imposed for noncompliance with these requirements include the suspension of individual employees limitations on engaging in certain activities for specified periods of time or for specified types of clients the revocation of registrations other censures and significant fines 

subsidiaries engaged in activities outside the us are regulated by various government agencies in the particular jurisdiction where they are chartered incorporated andor conduct their business activity for example pursuant to the uk financial services and markets act 2000 fsma certain of our subsidiaries are subject to regulations promulgated and administered by the fca the fsma and rules promulgated thereunder govern all aspects of the 

uk investment business including sales research and trading practices provision of investment advice use and safekeeping of client funds and securities regulatory capital recordkeeping margin practices and procedures approval standards for individuals antimoney laundering periodic reporting and settlement procedures 

 

 

our financial institution clients operating in the us are required to comply with privacy regulations imposed under the grammleachbliley act referred to as glba and numerous similar state laws glba and those state laws place restrictions on the use of nonpublic personal information all financial institutions must disclose detailed privacy policies to their customers and offer them the opportunity to direct the financial institution not to share information with third parties the regulations under glba however permit financial institutions to share information with nonaffiliated parties who perform services for the financial institutions as a provider of services to financial institutions we are required to comply with the privacy laws and are bound by the same limitations on disclosure of the information received from our clients as apply to the financial institutions themselves a determination that there have been violations of privacy laws could expose us to significant damage awards fines and other penalties that could individually or in the aggregate materially harm our business and reputation 

in july 2016 the european commission formally approved and adopted the euus privacy shield providing a compliance framework for organizations to transfer personal data regarding citizens of the eu to the us while we have certified certain lines of business under the privacy shield we have chosen to adopt eu model clauses published by the european commission as the primary basis for the export of data from the eu to the us 

the eus general data protection regulation gdpr which became effective on may 25 2018 applies to all organizations processing the personal data of individuals in the eu regardless of where such organization is based the gdpr has heightened our data protection compliance obligations impacted our businesses’ collection processing and retention of personal data and imposed stricter standards for reporting data breaches the gdpr also imposes significant penalties for noncompliance 

the company is also subject to the california consumer privacy act ccpa which came into effect on january 1 2020 and provides california residents additional data protection rights including the right to be informed about the personal information collected by third parties and the use of that personal information further certain operations of the company will be subject to the brazilian general personal data protection act which is scheduled to become effective in august 2020 the company has adopted a comprehensive global privacy program to assess and manage these evolving risks 

in addition our businesses are increasingly subject to laws and regulations relating to surveillance encryption and data onshoring in the jurisdictions in which we operate compliance with these laws and regulations may require us to change our technology for information security operational infrastructure policies and procedures which could be timeconsuming and costly 

 

we are also subject to certain economic and trade sanctions programs that are administered by the us treasury’s office of foreign assets control referred to as ofac which prohibit or restrict transactions to or from or dealings with specified countries their governments and in certain circumstances their nationals and with individuals and entities that are speciallydesignated nationals of those countries narcotics traffickers and terrorists or terrorist organizations similar antimoney laundering laws apply to movements of currency and payments through electronic transactions and to dealings with persons specified in lists maintained by the country equivalents to ofac in several other countries we have implemented policies procedures and internal controls that are designed to comply with the regulations and economic sanctions programs administered by ofac as well as all other applicable antimoney laundering laws and regulations 

 

our consumer reporting and consumerfacing businesses are subject to cfpb bulletin 20137 a succesor to the former regulation aa  unfair deceptive acts or practices which defines unfair deceptive or abusive acts or practices udaap this specific bulletin states that udaaps can cause significant financial injury to consumers erode consumer confidence and undermine fair competition in the financial marketplace original creditors and other covered persons and service providers under the doddfrank act involved in collecting debt related to any consumer financial product or service are subject to the prohibition against udaaps in the doddfrank act 

 

 

the foregoing list of laws and regulations to which our company is subject is not exhaustive and the regulatory framework governing our operations changes continuously enactment of new laws and regulations may increasingly affect the 

operations of our business directly and indirectly which could result in substantial regulatory compliance costs litigation expense adverse publicity andor loss of revenue 

information security 

globally attacks on information technology systems continue to grow in frequency complexity and sophistication this is a trend we expect to continue such attacks have become a point of focus for individuals businesses and governmental entities the objectives of these attacks include among other things gaining unauthorized access to systems to facilitate financial fraud disrupt operations cause denial of service events corrupt data and steal nonpublic information these circumstances present both a threat and an opportunity for fis as part of our business we electronically receive process store and transmit a wide range of confidential information including sensitive customer information and personal consumer data we also operate payment cash access and prepaid card systems 

fis remains focused on making strategic investments in information security to protect our clients and our information systems this includes both capital expenditures and operating expense on hardware software personnel and consulting services we also participate in industry and governmental initiatives to improve information security for our clients through the expertise we have gained with this ongoing focus and involvement we have developed fraud security risk management and compliance solutions to target this growth opportunity in the financial services industry

risk factors 

tableend 

in addition to the normal risks of business we are subject to significant risks and uncertainties including those listed below and others described elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k any of the risks described herein could result in a significant adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

risks related to our business and operations 

security breaches or attacks or our failure to comply with information security laws or regulations or industry security requirements could harm our business by disrupting delivery of services and damaging the reputation of fis and could result in a breach of one or more client contracts 

  

fis electronically receives processes stores and transmits sensitive business information of its clients in addition fis collects personal consumer data such as names and addresses social security numbers driver’s license numbers cardholder data and payment history records such information is necessary to support our clients’ transaction processing and to conduct our check authorization and collection businesses the uninterrupted operation of information systems as well as the confidentiality of the customerconsumer information that resides on such systems is critical to the successful operation of fis for that reason cybersecurity is one of the principal operational risks fis faces as a provider of services to financial institutions if fis fails to maintain an adequate security infrastructure adapt to emerging security threats or implement 

sufficient security standards and technology to protect against security breaches the confidentiality of the information fis secures could be compromised unauthorized access to the computer systems or databases of fis could result in the theft or publication of confidential information the deletion or modification of records damages from legal actions from clients andor their customers or otherwise cause interruptions in fis operations and damage to its reputation these risks are greater with increased information transmission over the internet the increasing level of sophistication posed by cyber criminals nation statesponsored cyber attacks and the integration of fis systems with those of acquired companies such as worldpay 

as a provider of services to financial institutions and a provider of card processing services fis is bound by the same limitations on disclosure of the information fis receives from clients as apply to the clients themselves if fis fails to comply with these regulations and industry security requirements it could be exposed to damages from legal actions from clients andor their customers governmental proceedings governmental notice requirements and the imposition of significant fines or prohibitions on card processing services in addition if more restrictive privacy laws rules or industry security requirements are adopted in the future on the federal or state level or by a specific industry body they could have an adverse impact on fis through increased costs or restrictions on business processes 

any inability to prevent security or privacy breaches or the perception that such breaches may occur could cause existing clients to lose confidence in fis systems and terminate their agreements with fis inhibit fis ability to attract new clients result in increasing regulation or bring about other adverse consequences from the government agencies that regulate fis 

entity mergers or consolidations and business failures in the banking and financial services industry could adversely affect our business by eliminating some of our existing and potential clients and making us more dependent on a more limited number of clients 

there has been and continues to be substantial consolidation activity in the banking and financial services industry in addition certain financial institutions that experienced negative operating results including some of our clients have failed these consolidations and failures reduce our number of potential clients and may reduce our number of existing clients which could adversely affect our revenue even if the events do not reduce the aggregate activities of the consolidated entities further if our clients or our partners across any of our businesses fail andor merge with or are acquired by other entities that are not our clients or our partners or that use fewer of our services they may discontinue or reduce use of our services it is also possible that larger financial institutions resulting from consolidations would have greater leverage in negotiating terms or could decide to perform inhouse some or all of the services we currently provide or could provide any of these developments could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

increased merchant financial institution or referral partner attrition and decreased transaction volume could cause fis revenue to decline 

our merchant business may experience attrition and declines in merchant and financial institution credit debit or prepaid card processing volume resulting from several factors including business closures consolidations loss of accounts to competitors account closures that it initiates due to heightened credit risks and reductions in its merchants sales volumes our referral partners many of which are not exclusive such as merchant banks technology solution partners payment facilitators independent sales organizations and trade associations are contributors to our revenue growth if a referral partner switches to another transaction processor shuts down or becomes insolvent we will no longer receive new merchant referrals from the referral partner and we risk losing existing merchants that were originally enrolled by the referral partner fis cannot predict the level of attrition and decreased transaction volume in the future and its revenue could decline as a result of higherthanexpected attrition which could have a material adverse effect on fis business financial condition and results of operations 

if we fail to innovate or adapt our services to changes in technology or in the marketplace or if our ongoing efforts to upgrade or implement our technology are not successful we could lose clients or our clients could lose customers and we could have difficulty attracting new clients for our services 

the markets for our services are characterized by constant technological changes frequent introductions of new services and evolving industry standards our future success will be significantly affected by our ability to enhance our current solutions and develop and introduce new solutions and services that address the increasingly sophisticated needs of our clients and their customers in addition as more of our revenue and market demand shifts to software as a service saas business process as a service bpaas cloud and new emerging technologies the need to keep pace with rapid technology changes becomes more acute these initiatives carry the risks associated with any new solution development effort including cost overruns delays in delivery and implementation and performance issues there can be no assurance that we will be successful in developing marketing and selling new solutions or enhancements that meet these changing demands that we will not experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development implementation introduction and marketing of 

these solutions or enhancements or that our new solutions and enhancements will adequately meet the demands of the marketplace and achieve market acceptance any of these developments could have an adverse impact on our future revenue andor business prospects 

we operate in a competitive business environment if we are unable to compete effectively our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 

the market for our services is intensely competitive our competitors in banking and capital market solutions vary in size and in the scope and breadth of the solutions and services they offer some of our competitors have substantial resources we face direct competition from third parties and because many of our larger potential clients have historically developed their key applications inhouse and therefore view their system requirements from a makeversusbuy perspective we also often compete against our potential clients inhouse capacities in addition the markets in which we compete have recently attracted increasing competition from smaller startups with emerging technologies which are receiving increasing investments global banks and businesses controlled by combinations of global banks and global internet companies that are introducing competitive products and services into the marketplace particularly in the payments area emerging technologies and increased competition may also have the effect of unbundling bank solutions and result in displacing solutions we are currently providing from our legacy systems international competitors are also now targeting and entering the us market with greater force there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors or that the competitive pressures we face in the markets in which we operate will not materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

in the merchant business our competitors include financial institutions and wellestablished payment processing companies in this business our us competitors that are financial institutions or are affiliated with financial institutions may not incur the sponsorship costs we incur for registration with the payment networks accordingly these competitors may be able to offer more attractive fees to our current and prospective clients or other services that we do not provide competition could result in a loss of existing clients and greater difficulty attracting new clients furthermore if competition causes us to reduce the fees we charge in order to attract or retain clients there is no assurance we can successfully control our costs in order to maintain our profit margins one or more of these factors could have a material adverse effect on fis business financial condition and results of operations 

fis is currently facing new competitive pressure from nontraditional payment processors and other parties entering the payments industry which may compete in one or more of the functions performed in processing merchant transactions these competitors have significant financial resources and robust networks and are highly regarded by consumers if these competitors gain a greater share of total electronic payments transactions or if we are unable to successfully react to changes in the industry spurred by the entry of these new market participants then it could have a material adverse effect on fis business financial condition and results of operations see item 1 business competition 

global economic political and other conditions including business cycles seasonality and consumer confidence may adversely affect our clients or trends in consumer spending which may adversely impact the demand for our services and our revenue and profitability 

a significant portion of our revenue is derived from transaction processing fees the global transaction processing industries depend heavily upon the overall level of consumer business and government spending any change in economic factors including a sustained deterioration in general economic conditions or consumer confidence particularly in the us or increases in interest rates in key countries in which we operate may adversely affect consumer spending consumer debt levels and credit and debit card usage and as a result adversely affect our financial performance by reducing the number or average purchase amount of transactions that we service 

when there is a slowdown or downturn in the economy a drop in stock market levels or trading volumes or an event that disrupts the financial markets our business and financial results particularly with respect to our capital markets segment may suffer for a number of reasons customers may react to worsening conditions by reducing their capital expenditures in general or by specifically reducing their information technology spending in addition customers may curtail or discontinue trading operations delay or cancel information technology projects or seek to lower their costs by renegotiating vendor contracts moreover competitors may respond to market conditions by lowering prices and attempting to lure away our customers to lower cost solutions any further protective trade policies or actions taken by the us may also result in other countries reducing or making more expensive services permitted to be provided by usbased companies if any of these circumstances remain in effect for an extended period of time there could be a material adverse effect on our financial results 

the merchant business has experienced in the past and expects to continue to experience seasonal fluctuations in its revenue as a result of consumer spending patterns historically merchant revenue has been strongest in the fourth quarter and weakest in the first quarter this is due to the increase in the number and amount of electronic payment transactions related to seasonal retail events 

constraints within global financial markets or international regulatory requirements could constrain our financial institution clients ability to purchase our services impacting our future growth and profitability 

a significant number of our clients and potential clients may hold sovereign debt of economically struggling nations or be subject to international banking regulatory requirements such as basel iii and a set of further reforms known as basel iv scheduled to be phased in commencing in january 2022 which may require changes in their capitalization and hence the amount of their working capital available to purchase our services these potential constraints could alter the ability of clients or potential clients to purchase our services and thus could have a significant impact on our future growth and profitability 

the sales and implementation cycles for many of our software and service offerings can be lengthy and require significant investment from both our clients and fis if we fail to close sales or if a client chooses not to complete an installation after expending significant time and resources to do so then our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 

the sales and associated deployment of many of our software or service offerings often involve significant capital commitments by our clients andor fis potential clients generally commit significant resources to an evaluation of available software and services and require us to expend substantial time effort and money educating them prior to sales further as part of the sale or deployment of our software and services clients may also require fis to perform significant related services to complete a proof of concept or custom development to meet their needs all of the aforementioned activities may require the expenditure of significant funds and management resources and ultimately the client may determine not to close the sale or complete the implementation if we are unsuccessful in closing sales or implementing our solutions or if the client decides not to complete an implementation after we expend significant funds and management resources or we experience delays then it could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our results may fluctuate from period to period because of the lengthy and unpredictable sales cycle for our software changes in our mix of licenses and services activity by competitors and customer budgeting operational requirements or renewal cycles 

particularly with respect to our capital markets segment our operating results may fluctuate from period to period and be difficult to predict in a particular period due to the timing and magnitude of software license sales and other factors we offer a number of our software solutions on a license basis which means that the customer has the right to run the software on its own or a third partys hardware we generally recognize license revenue when the license contract is signed the software is delivered and the term has begun the value of the license often depends on a number of customerspecific factors such as the number of customer locations users or accounts the sales cycle for a software license may be lengthy and take unexpected turns thus it is difficult to predict when software sales will occur or how much revenue they will generate because there are few incremental costs associated with software sales our operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year due to the timing and magnitude of software sales our results may also vary as a result of pricing pressures increased cost of equipment the evolving and unpredictable markets in which our solutions and services are sold changes in accounting principles and competitors new solutions or services 

in addition there are a number of other factors that could cause our sales and results of operation to fluctuate from period to period including the following 

 

failure to obtain new clients or renew client contracts on favorable terms could adversely affect results of operations and financial condition 

we may face pricing pressure in obtaining and retaining our clients larger clients may be able to seek price reductions from us when they renew a contract when a contract is extended or when the clients business has significant volume changes larger clients may also reduce services if they decide to move services inhouse further our smaller and midsize clients may also exert pricing pressure particularly upon renewal due to competition or other economic needs or pressures being experienced by the client on some occasions this pricing pressure results in lower revenue from a client than we had anticipated based on our previous agreement with that client this reduction in revenue could adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

further failure to renew client contracts on favorable terms could have an adverse effect on our business our contracts with clients generally run for several years and include liquidated damage provisions that provide for early termination fees terms are generally renegotiated prior to the end of a contracts term if we are not successful in achieving a high rate of contract renewals on favorable terms then our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

our business and operating results could be adversely affected if we experience business interruptions errors or failure in connection with our or thirdparty information technology and communication systems and other software and hardware used in connection with our business if we experience defects or design errors in the software solutions we offer or more generally if the thirdparty vendors we rely upon are unwilling or unable to provide the services we need to effectively operate our business 

many of our services are based on sophisticated software and computing systems and we may encounter delays when developing new technology solutions and services further the technology solutions underlying our services have occasionally contained and may in the future contain undetected errors or defects when first introduced or when new versions are released in addition we may experience difficulties in installing or integrating our technologies on platforms used by our clients or our clients may cancel a project after we have expended significant effort and resources to complete an installation finally our systems and operations could be exposed to damage or interruption from fire natural disaster power loss telecommunications failure unauthorized entry and computer viruses defects in our technology solutions errors or delays in the processing of electronic transactions or other difficulties could result in i interruption of business operations ii delay in market acceptance iii additional development and remediation costs iv diversion of technical and other resources v loss of clients vi negative publicity or vii exposure to liability claims any one or more of the foregoing could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations although we attempt to limit our potential liability through controls including system redundancies security controls application development and testing controls and disclaimers and limitationofliability provisions in our license and client agreements we cannot be certain that these measures will always be successful in preventing disruption or limiting our liability 

further most of the solutions we offer are very complex software systems that are regularly updated no matter how careful the design and development complex software often contains errors and defects when first introduced and when major new updates or enhancements are released if errors or defects are discovered in current or future solutions then we may not be able to correct them in a timely manner if at all in our development of updates and enhancements to our software solutions we may make a major design error that makes the solution operate incorrectly or less efficiently the failure of software to properly perform could result in the company and its clients being subjected to losses or liability including censures fines or other sanctions by the applicable regulatory authorities and we could be liable to parties who are financially harmed by those errors in addition such errors could cause the company to lose revenue lose clients or damage its reputation 

in addition we generally depend on a number of third parties both in the united states and internationally to supply elements of our systems computers research and market data connectivity communication network infrastructure other equipment and related support and maintenance we cannot be certain that any of these third parties will be able to continue providing these services to effectively meet our evolving needs if our vendors or in certain cases vendors of our customers fail to meet their obligations provide poor or untimely service or we are unable to make alternative arrangements for the provision of these services then we may in turn fail to provide our services or to meet our obligations to our customers and our business financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected 

  

the doddfrank act the cfpb and rules and regulations adopted by state regulatory authorities such as the new york state department of financial services may result in business changes for certain of our businesses and clients these have had and further could have an adverse effect on our financial condition revenue results of operations or prospects for future growth and overall business 

the doddfrank act represented a comprehensive overhaul of the regulations governing the financial services industry within the us the doddfrank act established the cfpb and provided the cfpb with rulemaking authority with respect to certain federal consumer protection statutes as well as examination and supervisory authority over consumer reporting agencies including chexsystems 

the cfpb continues to establish rules and regulations for regulating financial and nonfinancial institutions and providers to those institutions to ensure adequate protection of consumer privacy and to ensure consumers are not impacted by deceptive business practices these rules and regulations govern our clients or potential clients and also govern certain of our businesses these regulations have resulted and may further result in the need for fis to make capital investments to modify our solutions and services to facilitate our clients and potential clients compliance as well as to deploy additional processes or reporting to comply with these regulations in the future we may be subject to additional expense to ensure continued compliance with applicable laws and regulations and to investigate defend andor remedy actual or alleged violations further requirements of these regulations have resulted and could further result in changes in our business practices our clients business practices and those of other marketplace participants that may alter the delivery of services to consumers which have impacted and could further impact the demand for our software and services as well as alter the type or volume of transactions that we process on behalf of our clients as a result these requirements or proposed or future requirements could have an adverse impact on our financial condition revenue results of operations prospects for future growth and overall business 

the new york department of financial services has enacted new rules that require covered financial institutions to establish and maintain cybersecurity programs these and a set of newer rules just issued subject fis to additional regulation and require us to adopt additional business practices that could also require additional capital expenditures or impact our operating results changes to state money transmission laws and regulations including changing interpretations and the implementation of new or varying regulatory requirements may result in the need for additional money transmitter licenses these changes could result in increased costs of compliance as well as fines or penalties 

moreover the legislative and regulatory landscape for financial crimes compliance continues to evolve and any failure to comply with such laws could expose us to liability andor reputational damage financial crimes laws may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to country and impose inconsistent or conflicting requirements complying with varying jurisdictional requirements could increase the costs and complexity of compliance and associated recordkeeping costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business 

the company is subject to regulation supervision and enforcement authority of numerous governmental and regulatory bodies in the jurisdictions in which it operates which includes banking regulators and the cfpb in the us the fca and psr in the uk and the dnb in the netherlands 

because the company is a technology service provider to us financial institutions it is subject to regular oversight and examination by the federal banking agencies fba each of which is a member of the ffiec an interagency body of federal banking regulators the fba have broad discretion in the implementation interpretation and enforcement of banking and consumer protection laws and use the ffiecs uniform principles standards and report forms in its review of bank service providers like fis a failure to comply with these laws or a failure to meet the supervisory expectations of the banking regulators could result in adverse action against the company the regulators have the power to among other things enjoin unsafe or unsound practices require affirmative actions to correct any violation or practice issue administrative orders that can be judicially enforced direct the sale of subsidiaries or other assets and assess civil money penalties 

the company is also subject to ongoing supervision by regulatory and governmental bodies across the world including economic and conduct regulators such as the fca and psr in the uk and the dnb in the netherlands and regulatory and governmental bodies responsible for issuing antimoney laundering antibribery and global economic sanctions regulations these various regulatory regimes require compliance across many aspects of our merchant activities in respect of capital requirements safeguarding training authorization and supervision of personnel systems processes and documentation 

if we fail to comply with relevant regulations then we risk reputational damage potential civil and criminal sanctions fines or other action imposed by regulatory or governmental authorities including the potential suspension or revocation of the permissionbased regulatory licenses which authorize the company to provide core services to customers certain aspects of our business may be determined by an appropriate regulator quasiregulatory body or the courts as not being conducted in 

accordance with applicable laws or regulations or we may face allegations of direct or indirect noncompliance with relevant regulatory regimes such as the misselling of financial products or other actions in the uk the netherlands and other jurisdictions as well as private litigation resulting from such actions this could result in an adverse effect on fis business reputation and customer relationships which in turn could adversely affect its financial position and performance 

we are also involved from time to time in regulatory investigations reviews and proceedings both formal and informal by regulatory authorities regarding our businesses certain of which may result in adverse judgments settlements fines penalties injunctions or other relief specifically the psr is carrying out a market review into cardacquiring services provided by merchant acquirers in the uk with the scope of such review to include the following the nature and characteristics of cardacquiring services who provides cardacquiring services and how their market shares have developed historically how merchants buy cardacquiring services whether there are credible alternatives to cardacquiring services for some or all merchants the outcomes of the competitive process including the fees merchants pay and the quality of service they receive because the psr is an economic regulator in the uk it has the power to issue directions in relation to the functioning of the card acquiring market in the uk as a result of this review further the european commission is conducting a review of the relevant eu regulations on interchange fees for cardbased payment transactions ifr to examine the appropriateness of the levels of interchange fees taking into account the use and cost of the various means of payments the level of entry of new players new technology and the impact of innovative business models on the market the primary purpose of this review is to understand whether overall costs for card acceptance for merchants including the overall merchant service charge have gone up down or broadly stayed the same since the introduction of the ifr the eu has overall authority to enforce and establish new standards or guidance which may require banks and payments institutions including our merchant business to modify current pricing and fee structures and the eu could choose to exercise such authority prior to or after conclusion of this review 

failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations may result in suspension or revocation of the permissionbased regulatory licenses andor restrictions on our ability to provide services andor the imposition of civil fines andor criminal penalties and sanctions 

many of our clients are subject to a regulatory environment and to industry standards that may change in a manner that reduces the types or volume of solutions or services we provide or may reduce the type or number of transactions in which our clients engage and therefore reduce our revenue 

our clients are subject to a number of government regulations and industry standards with which our services must comply our clients must ensure that our services and related solutions work within the extensive and evolving regulatory and industry requirements applicable to them federal state foreign or industry authorities could adopt laws rules or regulations affecting our clients businesses that could lead to increased operating costs and could reduce the convenience and functionality of our services possibly resulting in reduced market acceptance in addition action by regulatory authorities relating to credit availability data usage privacy or other related regulatory developments could have an adverse effect on our clients and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition revenue results of operations prospects for future growth and overall business elimination of regulatory requirements could also adversely affect the sales of our solutions designed to help clients comply with complex regulatory environments 

our revenue relating to all aspects of the sale of services to members of visa mastercard and other payment networks is dependent upon our continued certification and sponsorship and the loss or suspension of certification or sponsorship could adversely affect our business 

in order to provide our card processing services we must be certified including applicable sponsorship by visa mastercard american express discover and other similar organizations these certifications are dependent upon our continued adherence to the standards of the issuing bodies and sponsoring member banks the member financial institutions some of which are our competitors set the standards with which we must comply if we fail to comply with these standards we could be fined our certifications could be suspended or our registration could be terminated the suspension or termination of our certifications or any changes in or the enforcement of the rules and regulations governing or relating to the businesses of visa mastercard or other payment networks could result in a reduction in revenue or increased costs of operation for us which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business 

in order to provide merchant transaction processing services in the us and certain other jurisdictions we are registered through our bank sponsorships with the visa mastercard and other payment networks as service providers for member institutions as a result fis and many of its clients are subject to payment network rules if fis or its associated participants do not comply with the payment network requirements the payment networks could seek to fine fis suspend fis or terminate its registrations our merchant business has occasionally received notices of noncompliance and fines which have typically 

related to excessive chargebacks by a merchant or data security failures on the part of a merchant if fis is unable to recover fines from or pass through costs to its merchants or other associated participants then fis would experience a financial loss the termination of its registration or any changes in the payment network rules that would impair fis registrations could require the company to stop providing payment network services to the visa mastercard or other payment networks which would have a material adverse effect on fis business financial condition and results of operations 

outside of the us our merchant business primarily provides acquiring and processing services directly through international credit and debit card networks run by visa mastercard and other payment networks in order to access the card networks the company must maintain the relevant jurisdictional operating licenses or memberships in some markets where it is not feasible or possible for the company to have a direct acquiring license with a card network we have a relationship with a local financial institution sponsor as part of the companys registration with card networks either directly or indirectly through local sponsors the company is subject to operating rules including mandatory technology requirements promulgated by the card networks that could subject the company and its customers to a variety of fines and penalties as well as suspension and termination of membership or access 

changes in the contracts rules or standards of networks or relevant legal or regulatory scrutiny of pricing practices could adversely affect fis business financial condition and results of operations 

from time to time card and debit networks increase the interchange fees that they charge at their sole discretion our financial institution sponsors have the right to pass any increases in interchange and other fees on to us and they have consistently done so in the past while we are generally permitted under the contracts with our merchants to pass these fee increases along to our merchants through corresponding increases in our processing fees if we cannot continue to do so due to contractual or regulatory requirements or competitive pressures the inability to pass through such fees could have a material adverse effect on fis business financial condition and results of operations additionally in order to access the card networks directly as our merchant business does primarily outside the us we must pay card network membership fees which are subject to change from time to time and which we may be unable to pass along to our merchant clients potentially resulting in fis absorbing a portion or all of such increases in the future 

furthermore the rules and regulations of the various card associations and networks prescribe certain capital requirements any increase in the capital level required would further limit our use of capital for other purposes moreover as payment networks become more dependent on proprietary technology modify their technological approach or operating practices andor seek to provide value added services to issuers and merchants there is heightened risk that rules and standards may be governed by their own selfinterest or the selfinterest of third parties with influence over them which could materially impact fis competitive position and operations 

interchange fees and pricing practices have been receiving significant legal and regulatory scrutiny worldwide the resulting changes that could occur from proposed regulations or other forms of enforcement could alter the fees charged by us card associations and debit networks worldwide such changes could have an adverse impact on our business or financial condition and results of operations 

if fis agreements with us financial institution sponsors and clearing service providers to process electronic payment transactions are terminated or otherwise expire and we are unable to renew existing or secure new sponsors or clearing service providers then we will not be able to conduct our merchant business in the us 

in the us and certain other markets the visa mastercard and other payment network rules require our merchant business to be sponsored by a member bank in order to process electronic payment transactions because we are not a us bank we are unable to directly access these payment networks in the us we are currently registered with the visa mastercard and other payment networks through fifth third bank and other sponsor banks in the us and elsewhere our current agreement with fifth third bank expires in december 2024 these agreements with fifth third bank and other sponsors give such sponsors substantial discretion in approving certain aspects of our business practices in our merchant business including our solicitation application and qualification procedures for merchants and the terms of our agreements with merchants our financial institution sponsors discretionary actions under these agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we also rely on fifth third bank and various other financial institutions to provide clearing services in connection with our settlement activities without these sponsorships or clearing services agreements in our merchant business we would not be able to process visa mastercard and other payment network transactions or settle transactions in relevant markets including the us which would have a material adverse effect on fis business financial condition and results of operations furthermore fis financial results could be adversely affected if the costs associated with such sponsorships or clearing services agreements increase 

our securities brokerage operations are highly regulated and subject to risks that are not encountered in our other businesses 

one of our subsidiaries is an sec registered brokerdealer in the us and others are authorized by the fca to conduct certain regulated business in the uk domestic and foreign regulatory and selfregulatory organizations such as the sec finra and the fca can among other things fine censure issue ceaseanddesist orders against and suspend or expel a brokerdealer or its officers or employees for failure to comply with the many laws and regulations that govern brokerage activities those laws and regulations derive from a variety of policy considerations and address a wide range of topics including those designed to protect customers of brokerdealers and the privacy of their information and those designed to protect the integrity of the markets such as laws and regulations requiring brokerdealers to report suspicious activity of customers sanctions for failure to comply with such laws and regulations may arise out of currently conducted activities or those conducted in prior periods our ability to comply with these laws and regulations is largely dependent on our establishment maintenance and enforcement of an effective brokerage compliance program failure to establish maintain and enforce the required brokerage compliance procedures even if unintentional could subject us to significant losses lead to disciplinary or other actions and tarnish our reputation regulations affecting the brokerage industry may change which could adversely affect our financial results 

we are exposed to certain risks relating to the execution services provided by our brokerage operations to our customers and counterparties which include other brokerdealers active traders hedge funds asset managers and other institutional and noninstitutional clients these risks include but are not limited to customers or counterparties failing to pay for or deliver securities trading errors the inability or failure to settle trades and trade execution system failures as trading in the us securities markets has become more automated the potential impact of a trading error or a rapid series of errors caused by a computer or human error or a malicious act has become greater in our other businesses we generally can disclaim liability for trading losses that may be caused by our software but in our brokerage operations we may not be able to limit our liability for trading losses or failed trades even when we are not at fault as a result we may suffer losses that are disproportionately large compared to the relatively modest profit contributions of our brokerage operations 

privacy laws and regulations such as the gdpr have required and will further require fis to adopt new business practices and contractual provisions in existing and new contracts which may require transitional and incremental expenses which may impact our future operating results 

  

new privacy laws such as the gdpr in the eu continue to develop in unpredictable ways the company is also subject to the california consumer privacy act effective january 1 2020 and will be subject to the brazilian general personal data protection act which is scheduled to become effective in august 2020 failure to comply with these new laws could result in significant penalties damage to our brand and loss of business the company has incurred and will continue to incur costs to comply with these new laws there are also several additional privacy laws being considered by state legislatures the federal legislature and countries around the world so a more substantial compliance effort with varying regimes in different jurisdictions is considered probable in the future which will increase the costs and complexities of the business moreover privacy laws may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to country and impose inconsistent or conflicting requirements complying with varying jurisdictional requirements could increase the costs and complexity of compliance and associated recordkeeping costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business and incur additional costs data localization requirements in evolving data protection laws could also increase the cost and alter the approach to housing data around the world 

in addition our businesses are increasingly subject to laws and regulations relating to surveillance encryption and data onshoring in the jurisdictions in which we operate compliance with these laws and regulations may require us to change our technology for information security operational infrastructure policies and procedures which could be timeconsuming and costly 

if we fail to comply with applicable regulations or to meet regulatory expectations our business results of operations or financial condition could be adversely impacted 

the majority of our data processing services for financial institutions are not directly subject to federal or state regulations specifically applicable to financial institutions such as banks thrifts and credit unions however as a provider of services to these financial institutions our data processing operations are examined on a regular basis by various federal and state regulatory authorities and by international regulatory authorities such as the fca in certain jurisdictions if we fail to comply with any applicable regulations or guidelines for operations of a data services provider we could be subject to regulatory actions or rating changes may not meet contractual obligations and may suffer harm to our client relationships or reputation failure to meet the aforementioned requirements or to adapt to new requirements at the federal state or international level 

could inhibit our ability to retain existing clients or obtain new clients which could have an adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition 

in addition to our data processing services described above we also have business operations that store process or transmit consumer information or have direct relationships with consumers that are obligated to comply with regulations including but not limited to the fcra the federal fair debt collection practices act and applicable privacy requirements further our international businesses must comply with applicable laws such as the us foreign corrupt practices act failure to maintain compliance with or adapt to changes in any of the aforementioned requirements could result in fines penalties or regulatory actions that could have an adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition 

high profile payment card industry or digital banking security breaches could impact consumer payment behavior patterns in the future and reduce our card payment transaction volumes 

we are unable to predict whether or when high profile card payment or digital banking security breaches will occur and if they occur whether consumers will transact less on their payment cards or reduce their digital banking service if consumers transact less on cards issued by our clients or reduce digital banking services and we are not able to adapt to offer our clients alternative technologies then our revenue and related earnings could be adversely affected 

misappropriation of our intellectual property and proprietary rights or a finding that our patents are invalid could impair our competitive position 

our ability to compete depends in some part upon our proprietary solutions and technology despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our services or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary or challenge the validity of our patents with governmental authorities policing unauthorized use of our proprietary rights is difficult we cannot make any assurances that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of technology or that the agreements entered into for that purpose will be enforceable effective patent trademark service mark copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our applications and services are made available online misappropriation of our intellectual property or potential litigation concerning such matters could have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition as we increase our international business we are subject to further risks of misappropriation of our intellectual property risks in countries which have laws which are less protective of intellectual property or are enforced in a less protective manner 

if our applications or services are found to infringe the proprietary rights of others then we may be required to change our business practices and may also become subject to significant costs and monetary penalties 

as our information technology applications and services develop we are increasingly subject to infringement claims any claims whether with or without merit could i be expensive and timeconsuming to defend ii result in an injunction or other equitable relief which could cause us to cease making licensing or using applications that incorporate the challenged intellectual property iii require us to redesign our applications if feasible iv divert management’s attention and resources and v require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements in order to obtain the right to use necessary technologies or pay damages resulting from any infringing use 

some of our solutions contain open source software and any failure to comply with the terms of one or more of these open source licenses could adversely affect our business 

we use a limited amount of software licensed by its authors or other third parties under socalled open source licenses and may continue to use such software in the future some of these licenses contain requirements that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the open source software and that we license such modifications or derivative works under the terms of a particular open source license or other license granting third parties certain rights of further use by the terms of certain open source licenses we could be required to release the source code of our proprietary software if we combine our proprietary software with open source software in a certain manner additionally the terms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by us or other courts and there is a risk that these licenses could be construed in a manner that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our solutions in addition to risks related to license requirements usage of open source software can lead to greater risks than use of thirdparty commercial software as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on origin of the software we have established processes to help alleviate these risks including a review process for screening requests from our development organizations for the use of open source but we cannot be sure that all open source is submitted for approval prior to use in our solutions in addition many of the risks associated with usage of open source cannot be eliminated and could if not properly addressed adversely affect our business 

lack of system integrity fraudulent payments credit quality and undetected errors related to funds settlement or the availability of clearing services could result in a financial loss 

we settle funds on behalf of financial institutions other businesses and consumers and receive funds from clients card issuers payment networks and consumers on a daily basis for a variety of transaction types transactions facilitated by us include debit card credit card electronic bill payment transactions banking payments and check clearing that supports consumers financial institutions and other businesses these payment activities rely upon the technology infrastructure that facilitates the verification of activity with counterparties the facilitation of the payment as well as the detection or prevention of fraudulent payments if our continuity of operations integrity of processing or ability to detect or prevent fraudulent payments were compromised this could result in a financial loss to us in addition we rely on various financial institutions to provide ach services in support of funds settlement for certain of our solutions if we are unable to obtain such ach services in the future that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations in addition we may issue credit to consumers financial institutions or other businesses as part of the funds settlement a default on this credit by a counterparty could result in a financial loss to us furthermore if one of our clients for which we facilitate settlement suffers a fraudulent event due to a deficiency in their controls we may suffer a financial loss if the client does not have sufficient capital to cover the loss 

the referendum on the uks membership in the eu could cause disruption to and create uncertainty surrounding our business 

significant portions of our merchant business is located in and services clients in the uk we also have other business and operations in the uk and the eu the uk left the eu brexit on january 31 2020 pursuant to the terms of a withdrawal agreement concluded between the uk government and the council of the eu the withdrawal agreement includes a transition period until december 31 2020 during which time the uk will follow the eus rules and regulations and will remain in the single market and the customs union the goforward relationship between the uk and the eu will continue to be a point of negotiation during this transition period and there can be no guarantee as to what relationship will be agreed upon following the end of such transition period actions to implement brexit may also create global economic uncertainty which may cause clients to closely monitor their costs and reduce their spending on our solutions and services 

  

although the potential impact of brexit on our business cannot be fully assessed until the detailed terms of the uks continued relationship with the eu following the transition period are finalized and the uk negotiates concludes and implements successor trading arrangements with other countries it is likely that this withdrawal process will continue to result in a sustained period of economic and political uncertainty and complexity 

  

these developments or the perception that any of them could occur have had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on global economic conditions and the stability of global financial markets and could significantly reduce global market liquidity and restrict the ability of key market participants to operate in certain financial markets asset valuations currency exchange rates and credit ratings may be especially subject to increased market volatility lack of clarity about future uk laws and regulations as the uk determines which eu laws to replace or replicate following the transition period including financial laws and regulations tax and free trade agreements intellectual property rights supply chain logistics environmental health and safety laws and regulations competition laws immigration laws and employment laws could decrease foreign direct investment in the uk increase costs depress economic activity and restrict our access to capital if the uk and the eu are unable to negotiate acceptable terms following the transition period or if other eu member states pursue withdrawal barrierfree access between the uk and other eu member states or among the european economic area overall could be diminished or eliminated any of these factors could have a direct or indirect impact on our business in the uk and the broader eu on our suppliers and customers in the uk and the broader eu and on our business outside the uk and the broader eu which could have a material adverse effect on our business business opportunities financial condition cash flows and operating results 

failure to properly manage or mitigate risks in the operation of our wealth and retirement businesses in the us and the uk could have adverse liability consequences 

we have wealth and retirement businesses in the us and uk engaged in processing securities transactions on behalf of clients and serving as a custodian failure to properly manage or mitigate risks in those operations and increased volatility in the financial markets may increase the potential for and magnitude of resulting losses including those that may arise from human errors or omissions defects or interruptions in computer or communications systems or breakdowns in processes or in internal controls human errors or omissions may include failures to comply with applicable laws or corporate policies and procedures theft fraud or misappropriation of assets whether arising from the intentional actions of internal personnel or 

external third parties in addition the usbased business holds a charter in the state of georgia which exposes us to further regulatory compliance requirements of the georgia department of banking and finance the us wealth and retirement business is required to hold certain levels of regulatory capital as defined by the state banking regulator in georgia in the uk our platform securities and brokerdealer businesses are regulated by the fca and are subject to further regulatory capital requireme nts 

our business is subject to the risks of international operations including movements in foreign currency exchange rates 

the international operations of fis represented approximately 24 of our total 2019 revenue and are largely conducted in currencies other than the us dollar including the british pound sterling euro brazilian real and indian rupee as a result of the worldpay acquisition fis has significantly expanded its international presence by offering merchant acquiring including ecommerce services outside of the us including in the uk and eu countries where worldpays principal nonus operations are currently located our business and financial results could be adversely affected due to a variety of factors including the following 

 • unexpected or unfavorable changes in foreign laws regulatory requirements and related interpretations 

• difficulty of effective enforcement of contractual provisions in local jurisdictions 

• inadequate intellectual property protection in foreign countries 

 

as we expand our international operations more of our clients may pay us in foreign currencies conducting business in currencies other than the us dollar subjects us to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates that can negatively impact our results period to period including relative to analyst estimates or guidance our primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to foreign currencies in brazil europe including the uk and parts of asia the us dollar value of our net investments in foreign operations the periodic conversion of foreigndenominated earnings to the us dollar our reporting currency and our results of operations and in some cases cash flows could be adversely affected in a material manner by movements in foreign currency exchange rates these risks could cause an adverse effect on the business financial position and results of operations of the company 

failure to comply with antibribery and anticorruption laws could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences 

we are subject to the fcpa the uk bribery act and other antibribery anticorruption and antimoney laundering laws in various countries around the world the fcpa the uk bribery act and similar applicable laws generally prohibit companies as well as their officers directors employees and thirdparty intermediaries business partners and agents from making improper payments or providing other improper things of value to government officials or other persons for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business abroad or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment the fcpa also requires that us public companies maintain books and records that fairly and accurately reflect transactions and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls 

we conduct business in many foreign countries including a number of countries with developing economies and many of our employees thirdparty intermediaries and agents in such countries may have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies state owned or affiliated entities and other third parties where we may be held liable if they take actions in violation of these laws even if we do not explicitly authorize them although our policies and procedures require compliance with these laws and are designed to facilitate compliance with these laws we do business in many countries 

all over the world and cannot assure that our employees contractors or agents somewhere in the world will not take actions in violation of applicable laws or our policies for which we may be ultimately held responsible 

in the event that we believe or have reason to believe that our employees contractors or agents have or may have violated such laws we may be required to investigate or to have outside counsel investigate the relevant facts and circumstances detecting investigating and resolving actual or alleged violations can be extensive and require a significant diversion of time resources and attention from senior management further we cannot assure that any such investigation will successfully uncover all relevant facts and circumstances any violation of the fcpa the uk bribery act or other applicable antibribery or anticorruption laws could result in whistleblower complaints adverse media coverage investigations loss of export privileges and criminal or civil sanctions penalties and fines any of which could adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

we have businesses in emerging markets that may experience significant economic volatility 

we have operations in emerging markets primarily in brazil india southeast asia the middle east and africa these emerging market economies tend to be more volatile than the more established markets we serve in north america and europe which could add volatility to our future revenue and earnings 

acts of war or terrorism international conflicts political instability natural disasters or widespread outbreak of an illness could negatively affect various aspects of our business including our workforce and our business partners make it more difficult and expensive to meet our obligations to our customers and result in reduced revenue from our customers 

our global operations are susceptible to global events including acts or threats of war or terrorism international conflicts political instability and natural disasters we are also susceptible to a widespread outbreak of an illness or other health issue such as the recent covid19 coronavirus outbreak first reported in wuhan hubei province china in december 2019 resulting to date in tens of thousands of confirmed cases in china and many additional cases identified in other countries in which we conduct business although we have limited operations in china we are nevertheless exposed to business risk as a result of covid19 or other epidemics these events can spread to different locations across the globe and can have an adverse effect on the global economy reducing consumer and corporate spending upon which our revenue depends individual employees can become ill quarantined or otherwise unable to work andor travel due to health reasons or governmental restrictions some of our operations are in countries where the effects of a widespread illness could be magnified due to health care systems that are less welldeveloped than in the us the occurrence of any of these events including the potential future effects of the covid19 outbreak could have an adverse effect on our business results and financial condition 

failure to attract and retain skilled technical employees or senior management personnel could harm our ability to grow 

our future success depends upon our ability to attract and retain highlyskilled technical personnel because the development of our solutions and services requires knowledge of computer hardware operating system software system management software and application software our technical personnel must be proficient in a number of disciplines competition for such technical personnel is intense and our failure to hire and retain talented personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

our future growth will also require sales and marketing financial and administrative personnel to develop and support new solutions and services to enhance and support current solutions and services and to expand operational and financial systems there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain the necessary personnel to accomplish our growth strategies and we may experience constraints that could adversely affect our ability to satisfy client demand in a timely fashion 

our ability to maintain compliance with applicable laws rules and regulations and to manage and monitor the risks facing our business relies upon the ability to maintain skilled compliance security risk and audit professionals competition for such skillsets is intense and our failure to hire and retain talented personnel could have an adverse effect on our internal control environment and impact our operating results 

our senior management team has significant experience in the financial services industry and the loss of this leadership could have an adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition further the loss of this leadership may have an adverse impact on senior managements ability to provide effective oversight and strategic direction for all key functions within the company which could impact our future business operating results and financial condition 

we are the subject of various legal proceedings that could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability 

we are involved in various litigation matters including in some instances classaction cases and patent infringement litigation if we are unsuccessful in our defense of litigation matters we may be forced to pay damages andor change our business practices any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

  

unfavorable resolution of tax contingencies or unfavorable future tax law changes could adversely affect our tax expense 

our tax returns and positions are subject to review and audit by federal state local and international taxing authorities an unfavorable outcome to a tax audit could result in higher tax expense and could negatively impact our effective tax rate financial position results of operations and cash flows in the current andor future periods unfavorable future tax law changes could result in negative impacts in addition taxlaw amendments in the united states and other jurisdictions could significantly impact how us multinational corporations are taxed although we cannot predict whether or in what form such legislation will pass if enacted it could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 

a material weakness in our internal controls could have a material adverse effect on us 

effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reasonable assurance with respect to our financial reports and to adequately mitigate risk of fraud if we cannot provide reasonable assurance with respect to our financial reports and adequately mitigate risk of fraud our reputation and operating results could be harmed internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations including the possibility of human error the circumvention or overriding of controls or fraud therefore even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements in addition projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

  

a material weakness is a deficiency or combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the companys annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting could adversely impact our ability to provide timely and accurate financial information if we are unable to report financial information timely and accurately or to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures we could adversely affect our business prospects 

fis expects that the worldpay acquisition may necessitate significant modifications to its internal control systems processes and information systems both on a transition basis and over the longer term as fis fully integrates the combined company due to the complexity of the merger fis cannot be certain that changes to internal control over financial reporting will be effective for any period or on an ongoing basis if fis is unable to accurately report financial results in a timely manner or is unable to assert that our internal controls over financial reporting are effective our business financial condition and results of operations and the market perception thereof may be materially adversely affected 

risks related to business combinations and ventures 

strategic transactions including acquisitions and divestitures involve significant risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

strategic acquisitions and divestitures we have made in the past and may make in the future present significant risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows these risks include the following 



 

we have substantial goodwill and other intangible assets recorded as a result of acquisitions and a severe or extended economic downturn could cause these assets to become impaired requiring writedowns that would reduce our operating income 

as of december 31 2019  goodwill aggregated to 522 billion  or 62 of total assets current accounting rules require goodwill to be assessed for impairment at least annually or whenever changes in circumstances indicate potential impairment factors that may be considered a change in circumstance include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results a significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization and negative industry or economic trends the results of our 2019 annual assessment of the recoverability of goodwill did not indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair values of the companys reporting units were less than the carrying values of those reporting units and thus no goodwill impairment existed as of december 31 2019 however if worldwide or us economic conditions decline significantly with negative impacts to bank spending and consumer behavior or if other business or market changes impact our outlook then the carrying amount of our goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets may no longer be recoverable and we may be required to record an impairment charge which would have a negative impact on our results of operations 

as of december 31 2019  intangible assets with finite useful lives aggregated to 158 billion  or 19 of total assets current accounting rules require intangible assets with finite useful lives to be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable factors that may be considered a change in circumstance include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results a significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization and negative industry or economic trends 

we will continue to monitor the fair value of our intangible assets as well as our market capitalization and the impact of any economic downturn on our business to determine if there is an impairment in future periods 

uncertainties associated with the worldpay acquisition may cause a loss of management personnel and other key employees which could adversely affect our future business and operations 

prior to the acquisition each of fis and worldpay were dependent on the experience and industry knowledge of their officers and other key employees to execute their business plans fis success after the acquisition will depend in part upon its ability to retain key management personnel and other key employees current and prospective employees of fis may experience uncertainty about their roles within fis following the acquisition or other concerns regarding the operations of fis following the acquisition any of which may have an adverse effect on the ability of fis to retain or attract key management and other key personnel if fis is unable to retain personnel after the acquisition including fis key management who are critical to the future operations of the company fis could face disruptions in its operations loss of existing customers loss of key information expertise or knowhow and unanticipated additional recruitment and training costs in addition the loss of key personnel could diminish the anticipated benefits of the acquisition no assurance can be given that fis will be able to retain or attract key management personnel and other key employees to the same extent that fis and worldpay were previously able to retain or attract their own employees 

  

fis may be unable to integrate the business of worldpay successfully or realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition 

the acquisition involved the combination of two companies that formerly operated as two independent public companies the combination of two independent businesses is complex costly and time consuming and fis will be required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating the business practices and operations of worldpay into fis potential difficulties that fis may encounter as part of the integration process include the following 

 

in addition it is possible that the integration process could result in the following 

   

 

any of these issues could adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with customers suppliers employees and other constituencies or achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition or could reduce our earnings or otherwise adversely affect our business and financial results 

  

the synergies attributable to the worldpay acquisition may vary from expectations 

fis may fail to realize the anticipated benefits and synergies expected from the acquisition which could adversely affect fis business financial condition and operating results the success of the acquisition will depend in significant part on fis ability to successfully integrate the acquired business grow the revenue of the combined company and realize the anticipated strategic benefits and synergies from the combination fis believes that the addition of worldpay will complement fis strategy by providing scale and revenue diversity accelerating fis growth strategy enabling fis to have a strong global footprint and to crosssell across each others client bases however achieving these goals requires growth of the revenue of the combined company and realization of the targeted cost synergies expected from the acquisition this growth and the anticipated benefits of the transaction may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected actual operating technological strategic and revenue opportunities if achieved at all may be less significant than expected or may take longer to achieve than anticipated if we are not able to achieve these objectives and realize the anticipated benefits and synergies expected from the acquisition within the anticipated timing or at all then our business financial condition and operating results may be adversely affected 

  

the future results of fis following the worldpay acquisition will suffer if fis does not effectively manage its expanded operations 

following the acquisition the size of the business of fis increased significantly beyond the prior size of either fis or worldpays business fis future success will depend in part upon its ability to manage this expanded business which will pose substantial challenges for management including challenges related to the management and monitoring of new operations and associated increased costs and complexity fis may also face increased scrutiny from governmental authorities as a result of the significant increase in the size of its business there can be no assurances that fis will be successful or that it will realize the expected operating efficiencies cost savings revenue enhancements or other benefits currently anticipated from the acquisition 

fis is expected to incur substantial costs related to the worldpay acquisition and integration 

fis is expected to incur substantial costs in connection with the worldpay acquisition and the related integration there are a large number of processes policies procedures operations technologies and systems that are in the process of being integrated including purchasing accounting and finance sales payroll pricing and benefits while fis has assumed that a 

certain level of costs will be incurred there are many factors beyond its control that could affect the total amount or the timing of the integration costs moreover many of the costs that will be incurred are by their nature difficult to estimate accurately these costs could particularly in the near term exceed the savings that fis expects to achieve from the elimination of duplicative costs and the realization of economies of scale and cost savings these integration costs may result in fis taking significant charges against earnings and the amount and timing of such charges are uncertain any material delays difficulties or unanticipated additional costs associated with integration activities may harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

the worldpay acquisition may result in a loss of customers distributors suppliers vendors landlords joint venture partners and other business partners and may result in the termination of existing contracts 

  

following the acquisition some of the customers distributors suppliers vendors landlords joint venture partners and other business partners of fis or worldpay may terminate or scale back their current or prospective business relationships with fis some customers may not wish to source a larger percentage of their needs from a single company or may feel that fis is too closely allied with one of their competitors if relationships with customers distributors suppliers vendors landlords joint venture partners and other business partners are adversely affected by the acquisition or if fis following the acquisition loses the benefits of the contracts of fis or worldpay our business and financial performance could suffer 

  

following the worldpay acquisition fis is subject to certain risks associated with the implementation of our merchant business new proprietary global acquiring platform 

our merchant business has made progress toward implementation of a new proprietary global acquiring platform project as we continue to implement this project through the migration of existing merchant customers and onboarding of new merchant customers to the platform the scale and complexity associated with this project presents the increased potential for service level delays or disruptions in the processing of transactions telecommunications failures or other difficulties such delays or disruptions could result in reputational harm loss of business and increased operational or technological costs 

following the worldpay acquisition fis may not be able to continue to expand its share of the existing payment processing markets or expand into new markets which would inhibit fis ability to grow and increase its profitability 

following the acquisition fis future growth and profitability will depend in part upon the growth of the payment processing markets in which fis currently operates and its ability to increase its penetration and service offerings within these markets as well as the emergence of new markets for merchant services and its ability to penetrate these new markets attracting new clients is difficult because of potential disadvantages associated with switching payment processing vendors such as transition costs business disruption and loss of accustomed functionality fis will seek to overcome these factors by making investments to enhance the functionality of the companys platforms and differentiate its services however there can be no assurance that these efforts will be successful and this resistance may adversely affect its growth 

fis expansion into new markets will also be dependent upon its ability to adapt existing merchant payment processing technology and offerings or to develop new or innovative applications to meet the particular service needs of each new market in order to do so fis will need to anticipate and react to market changes and devote appropriate financial and technical resources to its development efforts and there can be no assurance that it will be successful in these efforts 

furthermore in response to market developments fis may continue to expand into new geographical markets and foreign countries in which it currently has no operating experience however there can be no assurance that fis will be able to successfully continue such expansion efforts due to this lack of experience and the multitude of risks associated with global operations or lack of appropriate regulatory approval 

following the worldpay acquisition fraud by merchants or others could have a material adverse effect on fis business financial condition and results of operations 

in our merchant business we face potential liability for fraudulent electronic payment transactions initiated by merchants third parties or other associated participants examples of merchant fraud include when a merchant or other party knowingly accepts payment by a stolen or counterfeit credit debit or prepaid card card number or other credentials records a false sales transaction utilizing a stolen or counterfeit card or credentials processes an invalid card or intentionally fails to deliver the merchandise or services sold in an otherwise valid transaction in the event a dispute between a cardholder and a merchant is not resolved in favor of the merchant the transaction is normally charged back to the merchant and the purchase price is credited or otherwise refunded to the cardholder failure to effectively manage risk and prevent fraud would increase fis 

chargebacks or other liability increases in chargebacks or other liability could have a material adverse effect on fis business financial condition and results of operations following the acquisition this business is also subject to risk associated with the financial stability of its merchant clients 

following the worldpay acquisition worldpay as a subsidiary of fis continues to be a party to a tax receivable agreement tra and the amounts the company and its subsidiaries may be required to pay under the tra and certain related agreements are expected to be significant in certain cases payments under the tra may be accelerated andor significantly exceed the actual benefits fis realizes in respect of the tax attributes subject to the tra 

as result of the worldpay acquisition fis assumed a contingent liability pursuant to an existing tra with fifth third bank as of december 31 2019 the company has a liability recorded of approximately 564 million associated with the tra it is possible that future transactions or events including changes in tax rates could increase or decrease the actual tax benefits realized and the corresponding tra payments in december 2019 the company entered into a tax receivable purchase addendum the amendment that provides written call and put options collectively the options to terminate certain future obligations under the tra for fixed cash payments 

with respect to obligations not subject to the amendment or for which the options are not exercised the tra provides that upon certain mergers asset sales other forms of business combination or certain other changes of control fis obligations to make payments with respect to tax benefits would be based on certain assumptions including that fis would have sufficient taxable income to fully use net operating losses nols or deductions arising from increased tax basis of assets as a result fis could be required to make payments under the tra that are greater than 85 of actual tax savings 

if the irs challenges the tax basis increases or nols that give rise to payments under the tra and the tax basis increases or nols are subsequently disallowed payments under the tra could exceed our actual tax savings and the company may not be able to recoup previous payments under the tra or the amendment that were calculated on the assumption that the disallowed tax savings were available 

risks related to our indebtedness 

our existing debt levels and future levels under existing facilities and debt service requirements may adversely affect fis including our financial condition or business flexibility and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our outstanding indebtedness 

as of december 31 2019  we had total debt of approximately 202 billion  this level of debt or any increase in our debt level could adversely affect our business financial condition operating results and operational flexibility including the following i the debt level may cause us to have difficulty borrowing money in the future for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions or other purposes ii our debt level may limit operational flexibility and our ability to pursue business opportunities and implement certain business strategies iii some of our debt has a variable rate of interest which exposes us to the risk of increased interest rates iv we have a higher level of debt than some of our competitors or potential competitors which may cause a competitive disadvantage and may reduce flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions including increased competition and vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  v there are significant maturities on our debt that we may not be able to repay at maturity or that may be refinanced at higher rates and vi if we fail to satisfy our obligations under our outstanding debt or fail to comply with the financial or other restrictive covenants contained in the indenture governing our senior notes or our credit facility an event of default could result that could cause all of our debt to become due and payable 

we may be adversely affected by changes in libor reporting practices or the method in which libor is determined 

as of december 31 2019  we had outstanding approximately 600 million of variable debt that was indexed to the london interbank offered rate libor on july 27 2017 the fca announced its intention to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for calibration of libor to the administrator of libor after 2021 it is not possible to predict the further effect of the rules or policies of the fca any changes in the methods by which libor is determined or any other reforms to libor that may be enacted in the uk the eu or elsewhere any such developments may cause libor to perform differently than in the past or cease to exist in addition any other legal or regulatory changes made by the fca ice benchmark administration limited the european money markets institute formerly euriborebf the european commission or any other successor governance or oversight body or future changes adopted by such body in the method by which libor is determined or the transition from libor to a successor benchmark rate may result in among other things a sudden or prolonged increase or decrease in libor a delay in the publication of libor and changes in the rules or methodologies in libor which may discourage market participants from continuing to administer or to participate in libors determination 

and in certain situations could result in libor no longer being determined and published if a published us dollar libor rate is unavailable after 2021 the interest rates on our debt which is indexed to libor will be determined using various alternative methods any of which may result in interest obligations which are more than or do not otherwise correlate over time with the payments that would have been made on such debt if us dollar libor was available in its current form further the same costs and risks that may lead to the discontinuation or unavailability of us dollar libor may make one or more of the alternative methods impossible or impracticable to determine any of these proposals or consequences could have a material adverse effect on our financing costs 

our euro and gbpdenominated indebtedness has increased in recent years accordingly we have increased exposure to fluctuations in the eurousd and gbpusd exchange rates which could negatively affect our cost to service or refinance our euro and gbpdenominated debt securities 

in recent years our indebtedness denominated in euro or gbp has significantly increased as a result of our issuance of senior notes of varying maturities and our issuance of eurodenominated commercial paper at december 31 2019  the company had outstanding approximately €83 billion aggregate principal amount of eurodenominated senior notes approximately €22 billion aggregate principal amount of eurodenominated commercial paper and approximately £19 billion aggregate principal amount of gbpdenominated senior notes or the combined equivalent of approximately 142 billion aggregate principal amount 

following the acquisition of worldpay we have increased our revenue and cash flows denominated in euro and gbp although we currently have substantial available cash flows in excess of the projected debt service requirements on our existing euro and gbpdenominated debt we cannot assure that we will be always be able to continue generating earnings in euros and gbp in amounts sufficient taking into account the funding requirements and other needs of our business to make payments of interest andor repayment of principal on our euro and gbp senior debt or to permit us to economically borrow in those currencies if needed to refinance our existing euro and gbp debt if our cash flows in euros or gbp are insufficient for such purposes we may need to exchange us dollars or funds in other currencies to make such payments which could result in increased costs to us in the event of adverse changes in currency exchange rates we have utilized and expect to continue to utilize foreign currency forward contracts and other hedges on a limited basis in an effort to mitigate currency risk but we cannot assure that such hedging arrangements will be effective or will remain available to us on acceptable terms or at all in addition we cannot predict economic and market conditions including prevailing interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates at the applicable times when our various series of euro and gbp senior debt are scheduled to mature nor can there be any assurance that we would be able to refinance any series of our euro and gbp senior debt in those currencies on acceptable terms at any such time all of which could have an adverse financial impact on us 

rising interest rates could increase our borrowing costs 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our shortterm commercial paper borrowings revolving credit facility and interest rate derivatives in the future we may have additional borrowings under existing or new variablerate debt increases in interest rates on variablerate debt would increase our interest expense a rising interest rate environment could increase the cost of refinancing existing debt and incurring new debt which could have an adverse effect on our financing costs 

credit ratings if lowered below investment grade would adversely affect our cost of funds and liquidity 

the company maintains investment grade credit ratings from the major us rating agencies on its senior unsecured debt sp bbb moodys baa2 fitch bbb as well as its commercial paper program sp a2 moodys p2 fitch f2 failure to maintain investment grade rating levels could adversely affect the companys cost of funds and liquidity and access to certain capital markets but would not have an adverse effect on the companys ability to access its existing revolving credit facility

business trends and conditions 

our revenue is primarily derived from a combination of technology and processing services payment transaction fees professional services and software license fees the majority of our revenue has historically been recurring and has been provided under multiyear contracts in banking and capital markets that contribute relative stability to our revenue stream these services in general are considered critical to our clients operations although merchant has a lesser percentage of multiyear contracts a substantial part of its revenue is recurring a considerable portion of our recurring revenue is derived from transaction processing fees that fluctuate with the level of accounts and card transactions among other variable measures associated with consumer commercial and capital markets activity professional services revenue is typically nonrecurring though recognition often occurs over time rather than at a point in time sales of software licenses are typically nonrecurring with recognition at a point in time and are less predictable 

we continue to assist financial institutions in migrating to outsourced integrated technology solutions to improve their profitability and address increasing and ongoing regulatory requirements as a provider of outsourcing solutions we benefit from multiyear recurring revenue streams which help moderate the effects of broader yeartoyear economic and market changes that otherwise might have a larger impact on our results of operations we believe our integrated solutions and outsourced services are wellpositioned to address this outsourcing trend across the markets we serve 

over the last four years we have moved approximately 60 of our server compute to our fis cloud located in our strategic data centers and our goal is to increase that percentage to 73 by the end of 2020 and approximately 80 by the end of 2021 this allows us to further enhance security for our clients data and increases the flexibility and speed with which we can provide services and solutions to our clients eventually at lesser cost concurrently we have continued to consolidate our data centers closing seven additional data centers in 2019 our consolidation has generated a savings for the company as of yearend 2019 exceeding 170 million in run rate annual expense reduction since the programs inception in mid2016 we plan to close and consolidate approximately 13 more data centers by the end of 2021 which should result in additional run rate annual expense reduction of approximately 80 million 

we continue to invest in modernization innovation and integrated solutions and services in order to meet the demands of the markets we serve and compete with global banks financial and other technology providers and emerging technology innovators we invest both organically and through investment opportunities in companies building complementary technologies in the financial services space our internal efforts in research and development activities have related primarily to the modernization of our proprietary core systems in each of our segments design and development of next generation digital and innovative solutions and development of processing systems and related software applications and risk management platforms we have increased our investments in these areas in each of the last three years our innovation efforts have recently resulted in bringing to market our modern banking platform that is among the first cloudnative core banking solutions we expect to continue our practice of investing an appropriate level of resources to maintain enhance and extend the functionality of our proprietary systems and existing software applications to develop new and innovative software applications and systems to address emerging technology trends in response to the needs of our clients and to enhance the capabilities of our outsourcing infrastructure 

  

consumer preference continues to shift from traditional branch banking services to digital banking solutions and our clients seek to provide a single integrated banking experience through their branch mobile internet and voice banking channels we have been providing our large regional banking customers in the us with digital one an integrated digital banking platform and are now adding functionality and offering digital one to our community bank clients to provide a consistent omnichannel experience for consumers of banking services across selfservice channels like mobile banking and online banking as well as supporting channels for bank staff operating in bank branches and contact centers the uniform customer experience extends to support a broad range of financial services including opening new accounts servicing of existing accounts providing money movement services and personal financial management as well as other consumer small 

business and commercial banking capabilities digital one is integrated into several of the core banking platforms offered by fis and is also offered to customers of nonfis core banking systems 

  

we anticipate consolidation within the banking industry will continue primarily in the form of merger and acquisition activity among financial institutions which we believe as a whole is detrimental to the profitability of the financial technology industry however consolidation resulting from specific merger and acquisition transactions may be beneficial to our business when consolidations of financial institutions occur merger partners often operate systems obtained from competing service providers the newly formed entity generally makes a determination to migrate its core and payments systems to a single platform when a financial institution processing client is involved in a consolidation we may benefit by their expanding the use of our services if such services are chosen to survive the consolidation and support the newly combined entity conversely we may lose revenue if we are providing services to both entities or if a client of ours is involved in a consolidation and our services are not chosen to survive the consolidation and support the newly combined entity it is also possible that larger financial institutions resulting from consolidation may have greater leverage in negotiating terms or could decide to perform inhouse some or all of the services that we currently provide or could provide we seek to mitigate the risks of consolidations by offering other competitive services to take advantage of specific opportunities at the surviving company 

in certain of the international markets in which we do business we continue to experience growth on a constant currency basis demand for our solutions may also continue to be driven in developing countries by governmentled financial inclusion policies aiming to reduce the unbanked population and by growth in the middle classes in these markets driving the need for more sophisticated banking solutions the majority of our international revenue is generated by clients in the uk germany brazil india canada and australia for the full year of 2020 we do not expect a material impact to revenue due to foreign currency translation although the actual amount of impact is uncertain due to the many factors that affect exchange rates 

  

as a result of the worldpay acquisition fis is now a global leader in the merchant solutions industry with differentiated solutions throughout the payments market including capabilities in global ecommerce us integrated payments and enterprise payments and data security solutions in businesstobusiness b2b payments these solutions bring together advanced payments technologies at each stage of the transaction life cycle the worldpay acquisition which was completed on july 31 2019 broadens our solution portfolio enabling us to significantly expand our merchant acquiring solutions including our capabilities in the growing ecommerce and integrated payments segments of the market which are in demand among our merchant clients as they look for ways to integrate technology into their business models the combination also favorably impacts our business mix with a greater concentration in higher growth and higher margin services as we integrate worldpay into our existing operations we anticipate the potential to achieve incremental revenue opportunities and annual synergy runrate savings 

following the worldpay acquisition we are focused on completing postmerger integration to achieve potential incremental revenue opportunities and expense efficiencies created by the combination of the two companies we have a history of successfully integrating the operations and technology platforms of acquired companies including winding down legacy environments and consolidating platforms from other acquisitions into our environment based on prior integration experience we developed integration plans to achieve the potential benefits created by the worldpay acquisition as of the end of 2019 our achievement of expense and revenue synergies is ahead of schedule 

we co ntinue to see demand for innovative solutions in the payments market that will deliver faster more convenient payment solutions in mobile channels internet applications and cards our acquisition of worldpay will help position us to capitalize on this demand the payment processing industry is adopting new technologies developing new products and services evolving new business models and being affected by new market entrants and an evolving regulatory environment as merchants and financial institutions respond to these changes by seeking services to help them enhance their own offerings to consumers including the ability to accept cardnotpresent cnp payments in ecommerce and mobile environments as well as contactless cards and mobile wallets at the pointofsale fis believes that payment processors will seek to develop additional capabilities in order to serve clients evolving needs in order to facilitate this expansion we believe that payment processors will need to enhance their technology platforms so they can deliver these capabilities and differentiate their offerings from other providers 

we believe that these market changes present both an opportunity and a risk for us and we cannot predict which emerging technologies or solutions will be successful however fis believes that payment processors like fis that have scalable integrated business models provide solutions across the payment processing value chain and utilize broad distribution capabilities will be best positioned to enable emerging alternative electronic payment technologies further fis believes that its depth of capabilities and breadth of distribution will enhance its position as emerging payment technologies are adopted by merchants and other businesses fis ability to partner with nonfinancial institution enterprises such as mobile payment providers internet retail and social media companies could create attractive growth opportunities as these new entrants seek to 

become more active participants in the development of alternative electronic payment technologies and to facilitate the convergence of retail online mobile and social commerce applications 

globally attacks on information technology systems continue to grow in frequency complexity and sophistication this is a trend we expect to continue such attacks have become a point of focus for individuals businesses and governmental entities the objectives of these attacks include among other things gaining unauthorized access to systems to facilitate financial fraud disrupt operations cause denial of service events corrupt data and steal nonpublic information these circumstances present both a threat and an opportunity for fis as part of our business we electronically receive process store and transmit a wide range of confidential information including sensitive customer information and personal consumer data we also operate payment cash access and prepaid card systems 

fis remains focused on making strategic investments in information security to protect our clients and our information systems this includes both capital expenditures and operating expense on hardware software personnel and consulting services we also participate in industry and governmental initiatives to improve information security for our clients through the expertise we have gained with this ongoing focus and involvement we have developed fraud security risk management and compliance solutions to target this growth opportunity in the financial services industry 

for 2019 the worldpay acquisition significantly increased our revenue as well as our amortization expense for acquired intangibles and our acquisition integration and other costs also as described in note 19 of the notes to consolidated financial statements on december 31 2018 fis closed the transaction to unwind the brazilian venture with banco bradesco the results of the brazilian venture that were spunoff in the transaction were included within the banking segment on july 31 2017 we sold a majority interest in certain of our consulting businesses to affiliates of cdr these businesses had lower margins than many of our other businesses the consulting businesses sold were included within the capital markets segment also on february 1 2017 we sold our pse business which had been included in our corporate and other segment the worldpay acquisition and these divestitures affect the comparability of our results of operations for the 2019 2018 and 2017 periods presented 

critical accounting policies 

the accounting policies described below are those we consider critical in preparing our consolidated financial statements these policies require management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures with respect to contingent liabilities and assets at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods actual amounts could differ from those estimates see note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a more detailed description of the significant accounting policies that have been followed in preparing our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

the company generates revenue in a number of ways including from the delivery of account or transactionbased processing saas bpaas cloud offerings software licensing softwarerelated services and professional services our contracts frequently contain nonstandard terms that require judgment to determine the appropriate impact on revenue recognition we are frequently a party to multiple concurrent contracts with the same client these situations require judgment to determine whether the individual contracts should be combined or evaluated separately for purposes of revenue recognition in making this determination we consider the timing of negotiating and executing the contracts whether the different elements of the contracts are negotiated as a package with a single commercial objective whether the solutions or services promised in the contracts are a single performance obligation and whether any of the payment terms of the contracts are interrelated our individual contracts also frequently include multiple promised solutions or services at contract inception we assess the solutions and services promised in our contracts with customers and identify a performance obligation for each promise to transfer to the customer a solution or service or bundle of solutions or services that is distinct  ie if a solution or service is separately identifiable from other items in the bundled package and if a customer can benefit from it on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the customer we must apply judgment in these circumstances in determining whether individual promised solutions or services can be considered distinct or should instead be combined with other promised solutions or services in the contract we recognize revenue when or as we satisfy a performance obligation by transferring control of a solution or service to a customer we must use judgment to determine the appropriate measure of progress for performance obligations satisfied over time and the timing of when the customer obtains control for performance obligations satisfied at a point in time judgment is also required in estimating and allocating variable consideration to one or more but not all performance obligations in a contract determining the standalone selling prices of each performance obligation and allocating the transaction price to each distinct performance obligation in a contract 

due to the large number broad nature and average size of individual contracts we are party to the impact of judgments and assumptions that we apply in recognizing revenue for any single contract is not likely to have a material effect on our consolidated operations or financial position however the broader accounting policy assumptions that we apply across similar contracts or classes of clients could significantly influence the timing and amount of revenue recognized in our historical and future results of operations or financial position additional information about our revenue recognition policies is included in note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

software 

software includes the fair value of software acquired in business combinations purchased software and capitalized software development costs purchased software is recorded at cost and amortized using the straightline method over its estimated useful life which is generally three to five years software acquired in business combinations is recorded at its fair value and amortized using straightline or accelerated methods over its estimated useful life which is one to 10 years see also the purchase accounting section below as of december 31 2019 and 2018  software net was  32 billion and 18 billion  respectively and amortization of software was 616 million  468 million  and 436 million for the years ended december 31 2019  2018  and 2017  respectively balances related to acquired software represent a significant portion of these balances particularly for the period after the acquisition of worldpay which resulted in acquired software of 13 billion  

the capitalization of software development costs is governed by fasb asc subtopic 98520 if the software is to be sold leased or otherwise marketed or by fasb asc subtopic 35040 if the software is for internal use after the technological feasibility of the software has been established for software to be marketed or at the beginning of application development for internaluse software software development costs which include primarily salaries and related payroll costs and costs of independent contractors incurred during development are capitalized research and development costs incurred prior to the establishment of technological feasibility for software to be marketed or prior to application development for internaluse software are expensed as incurred evaluating whether technological feasibility has been achieved requires the use of management judgment 

software development costs are amortized on a productbyproduct basis commencing on the date of general release of the solutions for software to be marketed or the date placed in service for internaluse software software development costs for software to be marketed are amortized using the greater of 1 the straightline method over its estimated useful life which ranges from three to 10 years or 2 the ratio of current revenue to total anticipated revenue over its useful life 

in determining useful lives management considers historical results and technological trends that may influence the estimate useful lives for all software range from one to 10 years 

we also assess the recorded value of software for impairment on a regular basis by comparing the carrying value to the estimated future cash flows to be generated by the underlying software asset net realizable value analysis for software to be marketed there are inherent uncertainties in determining the expected useful life or cash flows to be generated from software for the year ended december 31 2019  we recorded 87 million in asset impairments primarily related to certain software to be marketed for the years ended december 31 2018 and 2017  respectively we have not had more than minimal charges for impairments of software while we have not historically experienced significant changes in these balances due to changes in estimates our results of operations could be subject to such changes in the future 

purchase accounting 

we are required to allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction at their estimated fair values the estimates used to determine the fair value of longlived assets such as intangible assets and software are complex and require a significant amount of management judgment we generally engage thirdparty valuation specialists to assist us in making fair value determinations the thirdparty valuation specialists generally use discounted cash flow models which require internallydeveloped assumptions to determine the acquisition fair value of customer relationship intangible assets and developed technology software assets assumptions for customer relationship asset valuations generally include forecasted revenue attributable to existing customer contracts and relationships estimated annual attrition forecasted ebitda margin and estimated weighted average cost of capital and discount rates assumptions for software asset valuations generally include forecasted revenue attributable to the software assets obsolescence rates estimated royalty rates and estimated weighted average cost of capital and discount rates 

if the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the combination occurs we are required to record provisional amounts in the financial statements for the items for which the accounting is incomplete adjustments to provisional amounts initially recorded that are identified during the measurement 

period are recognized in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined this includes any effect on earnings of changes in depreciation or amortization or other income effects as a result of the change to the provisional amounts calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date during the measurement period we are also required to recognize additional assets or liabilities if new information is obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that if known would have resulted in the recognition of those assets and liabilities as of that date the measurement period ends the sooner of one year from the acquisition date or when we receive the information we were seeking about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date or learn that more information is not obtainable 

we are also required to estimate the useful lives of intangible assets to determine the amount of acquisitionrelated intangible asset amortization expense to record in future periods we periodically review the estimated useful lives assigned to our finitelived intangible assets to determine whether such estimated useful lives continue to be appropriate additionally we review our indefinitelived intangible assets to determine if there is any change in circumstances that may indicate the assets useful life is no longer indefinite 

see note 3 to the notes to consolidated financial statements for discussion of the worldpay acquisition in 2019 we had no significant business combinations during 2018  

goodwill and other intangible assets 

goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives should not be amortized but shall be tested for impairment annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate potential impairment fasb asc subtopic 35020 allows an entity first to assess qualitatively whether it is more likely than not that a reporting units carrying amount exceeds its fair value referred to in the guidance as step zero if an entity concludes that it is more likely than not that a reporting units fair value is less than its carrying amount that is a likelihood of more than 50 percent the step one quantitative assessment must be performed for that reporting unit fasb asc subtopic 35020 provides examples of events and circumstances that should be considered in performing the step zero qualitative assessment including macroeconomic conditions industry and market considerations cost factors overall financial performance events affecting a reporting unit or the entity as a whole and a sustained decrease in share price performance of a qualitative impairment assessment requires judgment 

when applying the quantitative analysis we determine the fair value of our reporting units based on a weighted average of multiple valuation techniques principally a combination of an income approach and a market approach the income approach calculates a value based upon the present value of estimated future cash flows while the market approach uses earnings multiples of similarly situated guideline public companies if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the reporting units net assets goodwill is not impaired and further testing is not required 

we assess goodwill for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter or more frequently if circumstances indicate potential impairment for each of 2019  2018  and 2017 we began our annual impairment test with the step zero qualitative assessment in performing the step zero qualitative assessment for each year examining those factors most likely to affect our valuations we concluded that it remained more likely than not that the fair value of each of our reporting units continued to exceed their carrying amounts consequently we did not perform a step one quantitative assessment for the purpose of our annual impairment test for these years 

similar to the fasb asc subtopic 35020 guidance for goodwill fasb asc subtopic 35030 allows an organization to first perform a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that an indefinitelived intangible asset has been impaired we assess indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter or more frequently if circumstances indicate potential impairment for each of 2019  2018 and 2017  we performed a qualitative assessment examining those factors most likely to affect our valuations and concluded that it is more likely than not that our indefinitelived intangible assets were not impaired consequently we did not perform a quantitative impairment assessment for the purpose of our annual impairment test for these years 

determining the fair value of a reporting unit or acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives involves judgment and the use of significant estimates and assumptions which include assumptions regarding forecasted revenue growth rates operating margins capital expenditures tax rates and other factors used to calculate estimated future cash flows in addition riskadjusted discount rates and future economic and market conditions and other assumptions are applied goodwill was 522 billion and 135 billion as of december 31 2019 and 2018  respectively and indefinitelived intangible assets were 43 million as of each of december 31 2019 and 2018  as a result a meaningful change in one or more of the underlying forecasts estimates or assumptions used in testing these assets for impairment could result in a material impact on the 

companys results of operations and financial position however based on the qualitative assessment performed and because there was a substantial excess of fair value over carrying value in our previous thirdparty valuations performed in 2015 for goodwill and 2016 for indefinitelived intangible assets we believe the likelihood of obtaining materially different results based on a change of assumptions is low

consolidated results of operations 

in millions except per share amounts 



revenue 

revenue for 2019 increased 1910 million  or 227 from 2018 primarily due to incremental revenue from the worldpay acquisition and increased sales across our business lines as discussed in our segment results of operations below 

  

revenue for 2018 decreased 245 million  or 28 from 2017  due to 1 the reduction in revenue from the sale of the capco consulting business and the risk and compliance consulting business during the third quarter of 2017 2 the reduction in revenue from the sale of the pse business during the first quarter of 2017 3 the reduction in revenue from the sale of the certegy check services business unit in north america during the third quarter of 2018 and 4 lower volumes in the trading services and data business these decreases were partially offset by 1 increased volumes in debit loyalty and latin america payments 2 growth in wealth outsourcing core solutions and digital banking 3 strong demand for private equity and 

insurance offerings and 4 growth in the biller solutions business additionally 2018 was impacted by a 40 million unfavorable foreign currency impact primarily resulting from a stronger us dollar versus the brazilian real 

cost of revenue and gross profit 

cost of revenue totaled 6610 million   5569 million and  5794 million during 2019  2018 and 2017  respectively resulting in gross profit of 3723 million  2854 million and 2874 million  respectively gross profit as a percentage of revenue gross margin was 360  339 and 332 in 2019  2018 and 2017  respectively the increase in gross profit for 2019 as compared to 2018 primarily resulted from the revenue variances noted above the gross profit percentage for 2019 as compared to 2018 benefited from higher margin revenue from the worldpay acquisition partially offset by higher acquired intangible asset amortization expense 

  

selling general and administrative expenses 

selling general and administrative expenses for 2019 increased 1366 million  or 1050 from 2018  the yearoveryear increase was primarily driven by 1 incremental worldpay corporate and infrastructure expenses and 2 higher acquisition integration and other costs of 704 million in 2019 as compared to 156 million in 2018 these increases were partially offset by 1 the sale of reliance trust company of delaware during the fourth quarter of 2018 and 2 the sale of the certegy check services business unit in north america during the third quarter of 2018 

selling general and administrative expenses for 2018 decreased 141 million  or 98 from 2017  the yearoveryear decrease is primarily driven by the sale of pse during the first quarter of 2017 the sale of the capco consulting business and risk and compliance consulting business during the third quarter of 2017 the sale of certegy check services business unit in north america during the third quarter of 2018 and cost management initiatives 

asset impairments 

during 2019 the company recorded pretax asset impairments totaling 87 million primarily related to certain software resulting from the companys net realizable value analysis 

during 2018 as a result of entering into an agreement to unwind the brazilian venture that the company operated with banco bradesco the company recorded pretax asset impairments totaling 95 million including 42 million for the brazilian venture contract intangible asset 25 million for goodwill and 28 million for the assets being held for sale that were transferred to banco bradesco upon closing of the agreement see note 19 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

operating income 

operating income totaled 969 million  1458 million and 1432 million for 2019  2018 and 2017  respectively operating income as a percentage of revenue operating margin was 94  173 and 165 for 2019  2018 and 2017  respectively the annual changes in operating income resulted from the revenue and cost variances addressed above the change in operating margin during 2019 was negatively impacted by higher acquired intangible asset amortization expense higher acquisition integration and other costs and asset impairments of 87 million related to certain software the change in operating margin during 2018 was negatively impacted by asset impairments of 95 million related to the unwinding of the brazilian venture notwithstanding the asset impairments however operating margins improved primarily from cost management initiatives and the capco consulting business divestiture during 2017 

total other income expense net 

interest expense is typically the primary component of total other income expense net 

the increase of 75 million in interest expense in 2019 as compared to 2018 is primarily due to higher outstanding debt partially offset by a lower weighted average interest rate on the outstanding debt and an increase in interest income on the proceeds from the worldpay acquisitionrelated debt issuances prior to closing 

the decrease of 45 million in interest expense in 2018 as compared to 2017 is primarily due to a lower weighted average interest rate on the outstanding debt and benefits realized from interest rate swaps executed in the fourth quarter of 2018 which are discussed in note 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

other income expense net for 2019 includes a pretax charge of approximately 217 million in tender premiums and fees and the writeoff of previously capitalized debt issuance costs on the early redemption of approximately 30 billion in aggregate principal amount of our senior notes as well as approximately 33 million of acquisition financing costs related to the acquisition of worldpay these items were partially offset by the noncash foreign currency gain on nonhedged euro and pound sterlingdenominated notes issued to finance the worldpay acquisition during the period from the date of issue of the notes to the date of the acquisition 

other income expense net for 2018 includes a pretax loss of 54 million on the sale of the certegy check services business unit in north america and 12 million to unwind the brazilian venture partially offset by a pretax gain of 19 million on the sale of reliance trust company of delaware 

other income expense net for 2017 includes 1 a pretax charge of 171 million in tender premiums and the writeoff of previously capitalized debt issuance costs on the repurchase of approximately 20 billion in aggregate principal of our senior notes 2 a net pretax loss of 29 million on the sale of the capco consulting and risk and compliance business and other divestitures 3 a pretax charge of approximately 25 million due to the redemption of our senior notes and the pay down of term loans consisting of the call premium on the senior notes and the writeoff of previously capitalized debt issuance costs partially offset by 4 a pretax gain of 85 million on the sale of the pse business an 8 million pretax gain on an investment sale and a 12 million foreign currency gain 

provision benefit for income taxes 

provision benefit for income taxes from continuing operations totaled 100 million  208 million and 321 million for 2019  2018 and 2017  respectively this resulted in an effective tax rate on continuing operations of 242  188 and 329 for 2019  2018 and 2017  respectively the effective tax rate for the 2019 period included a detriment of 44 million due to nondeductible executive stock compensation primarily driven by acceleration of converted heritage worldpay stock compensation awards and the accrual of additional stock compensation due to reaching certain worldpay synergy targets and a detriment of 21 million due to the postacquisition combined state income tax rates the effective tax rate for the 2018 period included the impact of the reduction in the us federal income tax rate from 35 to 21 due to tax reform enacted december 22 2017 and a net detriment of 33 million due to the book basis in excess of the tax basis of certain businesses sold during the year the effective tax rate for the 2017 period included a net benefit of 761 million related to tax reform items including 48 million of tax credits due to tax planning strategies implemented in the fourth quarter and a net detriment of 180 million due to the book basis in excess of the tax basis of certain businesses sold during the year

liquidity and capital resources 

cash requirements 

our ongoing cash requirements include operating expenses income taxes tax receivable obligations mandatory debt service payments capital expenditures stockholder dividends working capital and timing differences in settlementrelated assets and liabilities and may include discretionary debt repayments share repurchases and business acquisitions our principal sources of funds are cash generated by operations and borrowings including the capacity under our revolving credit facility the us commercial paper program and the eurocommercial paper program described in note 12 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

as of december 31 2019  we had cash and cash equivalents of 12 billion and debt of 202 billion  including the current portion net of capitalized debt issuance costs approximately 570 million of cash and cash equivalents is held by our foreign entities the majority of our domestic cash and cash equivalents represents net depositsintransit at the balance sheet dates and relates to daily settlement activity we expect that cash and cash equivalents plus cash flows from operations over the next 12 months will be sufficient to fund our operating cash requirements capital expenditures and mandatory debt service 

we currently expect to continue to pay quarterly dividends however the amount declaration and payment of future dividends is at the discretion of our board of directors and depends on among other things our investment opportunities results of operations financial condition cash requirements future prospects and other factors that may be considered relevant by our board of directors including legal and contractual restrictions additionally the payment of cash dividends may be limited by covenants in certain debt agreements a regular quarterly dividend of 035 per common share is payable on march 27 2020 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on march 13 2020 

on july 20 2017 our board of directors approved a plan authorizing repurchases of up to 40 billion of our outstanding common stock in the open market at prevailing market prices or in privately negotiated transactions through december 31 2020 this share repurchase authorization replaced any existing share repurchase authorization approximately 23 billion of plan capacity remained available for repurchases as of december 31 2019  management temporarily suspended share repurchases as a result of the worldpay transaction to accelerate debt repayment 

cash flows from operations 

cash flows from operations were 2410 million  1993 million and 1741 million in 2019  2018 and 2017  respectively our net cash provided by operating activities consists primarily of net earnings adjusted to add back depreciation and amortization cash flows from operations increased 417 million in 2019 and 252 million in 2018  the 2019 increase in cash flows from operations is primarily due to increased cash flow due to the worldpay acquisition partially offset by the timing of working capital and worldpay acquisition transaction and integrationrelated expenses the 2018 increase in cash flows from operations is primarily due to lower trade receivables from increased collections resulting from a reduction in days sales outstanding these increases were partially offset by us federal estimated income tax payments normally due in the third and fourth quarters of 2017 that were paid during the first quarter of 2018 due to the hurricane irma relief program and timing of working capital 

capital expenditures and other investing activities 

our principal capital expenditures are for software purchased and internally developed and additions to property and equipment we invested approximately 828 million  622 million and 613 million in capital expenditures excluding other financing obligations for certain hardware and software during 2019  2018 and 2017  respectively in 2020 we expect to 

continue investing in property and equipment purchased software and internally developed software to support our core business initiatives we expect to invest a similar percentage of our 2020 revenue in capital expenditures as in previous years 

in 2019 we used 6629 million of cash net of cash acquired including restricted cash for the worldpay acquisition see note 3 of the notes to consolidated financial statements

recent accounting pronouncements 

recently adopted accounting guidance 

in february 2018 the fasb issued asu no 201802 asu 201802 income statement  reporting comprehensive income topic 220 reclassification of certain tax effects from accumulated other comprehensive income  asu 201802 allows companies to elect whether to reclassify from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings the tax effects of items within accumulated other comprehensive income referred to as stranded tax effects resulting from the tax cuts and jobs act fis adopted asu 201802 on january 1 2019 and did not elect to reclassify the income tax effects of the tax cuts and jobs act from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings as a result the adoption of this asu did not have an impact on the companys consolidated financial statements 

in february 2016 the fasb issued asu no 201602 leases topic 842  which requires lessees to recognize leases on the balance sheet and disclose key information about leasing arrangements topic 842 was subsequently amended by asu no 201801 land easement practical expedient for transition to topic 842  asu no 201810 codification improvements to topic 842 leases  asu no 201811 targeted improvements  asu no 201820 leases topic 842 narrowscope improvements for lessors and asu no 20191 leases topic 842 codification improvements collectively the new standard the new standard establishes a rightofuse rou model that requires a lessee to recognize an rou asset and lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with a term longer than 12 months leases are classified as finance or operating with classification affecting the pattern and classification of expense recognition in the income statement under the new standard lessor accounting is largely unchanged 

the new standard is effective for public business entities on january 1 2019 with early adoption permitted a modified retrospective transition approach is required applying the new standard to all leases existing at the date of initial application an entity may choose to use either 1 its effective date the effective date method or 2 the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements as its date of initial application if an entity chooses the second option the transition requirements for existing leases also apply to leases entered into between the date of initial application and the effective date the entity must also recast its comparative period financial statements and provide the disclosures required by the new standard for the comparative periods fis adopted the new standard effective january 1 2019 using the effective date method consequently financial information was not updated and the disclosures required under the new standard were not provided for dates and periods before january 1 2019 

the new standard provides several optional practical expedients in transition and for an entitys ongoing accounting we elected the package of practical expedients which permits us not to reassess under the new standard our prior conclusions about lease identification lease classification and initial direct costs we also elected the practical expedient not to separate lease and nonlease components we did not elect the useofhindsight practical expedient nor the shortterm lease recognition exemption 

the adoption of the new standard resulted in the recognition of operating lease rou assets and lease liabilities on the companys condensed consolidated balance sheet of 442 million and 446 million respectively on january 1 2019 the standard did not impact our results of operations or cash flows the companys accounting for finance leases which are immaterial remained substantially unchanged 

recent accounting guidance not yet adopted 

on august 29 2018 the fasb issued asu no 201815 asu 201815 intangiblesgoodwill and otherinternaluse software subtopic 35040 customers accounting for implementation costs incurred in a cloud computing arrangement that is a service contract  this asu clarifies that implementation costs incurred by customers in cloud computing arrangements should be deferred and recognized over the term of the arrangement if those costs would be capitalized by the customer in a software licensing arrangement under the internaluse software guidance the provisions in asu 201815 should be applied either retrospectively or prospectively to all implementation costs incurred after the date of adoption for public business entities asu 201815 is effective for annual periods beginning after december 15 2019 and interim periods within those annual periods with early adoption permitted we will prospectively adopt the new guidance effective january 1 2020 we expect that the new guidance will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

on june 16 2016 the fasb issued asu no 201613 asu 201613 financial instruments  credit losses topic 326 measurements on credit losses of financial instruments  this asu was subsequently amended by asu no 201819 codification improvements to topic 326 financial instruments  credit losses collectively topic 326 the primary objectives of topic 326 are to implement new methodology for calculating credit losses on financial instruments such as trade receivables based on expected credit losses and to broaden the types of information companies must use when calculating the estimated losses under current guidance the credit losses are calculated based on multiple credit impairment objectives and recognition is delayed until the loss is probable to occur under the new guidance financial assets measured at amortized cost basis must be shown as the net amount expected to be collected the credit loss allowance is a contravaluation account the new guidance also applies to receivables arising from revenue transactions such as contract assets for public business entities topic 326 is effective for annual periods beginning after december 15 2019 and interim periods within those annual periods with early adoption permitted we will adopt the new standard effective january 1 2020 we expect to apply a modified retrospective transition approach with a cumulative effect adjustment recorded in retained earnings as of the beginning of the year of adoption while we are continuing to evaluate the impact we expect that the new guidance will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risks 

tableend 

  market risk 

we are exposed to market risks primarily from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates we periodically use certain derivative financial instruments including interest rate swaps and foreign currency forward contracts to manage interest rate and foreign currency risk we do not use derivatives for trading purposes to generate income or to engage in speculative activity 

interest rate risk 

in addition to existing cash balances and cash provided by operating activities we use fixedrate and variablerate debt to finance our operations we are exposed to interest rate risk on these debt obligations and related interest rate swaps 

our fixedrate senior notes as described in note 12 of the notes to consolidated financial statements represent the majority of our fixedrate longterm debt obligations as of december 31 2019  the carrying value excluding the fair value of the interest rate swap described below and unamortized discounts of these senior notes was 166 billion as of december 31 2019  the fair value of these senior notes was approximately 175 billion as of december 31 2019  the potential reduction in fair value of the fixedrate senior notes from a hypothetical 10 percent increase in market interest rates would not be material to the overall fair value of the debt 

our variablerate risk principally relates to borrowings under our us commercial paper program eurocommercial paper program revolving credit facility senior euro floating rate notes as defined in note 12 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and an interest rate swap on our fixedrate longterm debt at december 31 2019  our weighted average cost of debt was 166 with a weighted average maturity of 62 years 78 of our debt was fixedrate and the remaining 22 of our debt was variablerate a 100 basis point increase in the weighted average interest rate on our variablerate debt would have increased our 2019 interest expense by 45 million  we performed the foregoing sensitivity analysis based solely on the principal amount of our variablerate debt as of december 31 2019  this sensitivity analysis does not take into account any changes that occurred in the prior 12 months or that may take place in the next 12 months in the amount of our outstanding debt further this sensitivity analysis assumes the change in interest rates is applicable for an entire year for comparison purposes based on principal amounts of variablerate debt outstanding as of december 31 2018  and calculated in the same manner as set forth above an increase of 100 basis points in the weighted average interest rate would have increased our annual interest expense by approximately 10 million  

as of december 31 2019  the following interest rate swap converting the interest rate exposure on our senior euro notes due july 2024 from fixed to variable is outstanding in millions 



1 0460 in effect as of december 31 2019 

we designated the interest rate swap as a fair value hedge for accounting purposes as described in note 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements a 100 basis point increase in the 3month euribor rate would increase our annual interest expense on this swap by approximately 6 million  

foreign currency risk 

we are exposed to foreign currency risks that arise from normal business operations these risks include the translation of local currency balances of foreign subsidiaries transaction gains and losses associated with intercompany loans with foreign subsidiaries and transactions denominated in currencies other than a locations functional currency we manage the exposure to these risks through a combination of normal operating activities and the use of foreign currency forward contracts and nonderivative and derivative investment hedges 

our exposure to foreign currency exchange risks generally arises from our nonus operations to the extent they are conducted in local currency changes in foreign currency exchange rates affect translations of revenue denominated in currencies other than the us dollar during the years ended december 31 2019  2018 and 2017  we generated approximately 

1852 million  1542 million and 1821 million  respectively in revenue denominated in currencies other than the us dollar the major currencies to which our revenue is exposed are the british pound sterling euro brazilian real and indian rupee a 10 move in average exchange rates for these currencies assuming a simultaneous and immediate 10 change in all of such rates for the relevant period would have resulted in the following increase or decrease in our reported revenue for the years ended december 31 2019  2018 and 2017 in millions 



while our results of operations have been impacted by the effects of currency fluctuations our international operations revenue and expenses are generally denominated in local currency which reduces our economic exposure to foreign exchange risk in those jurisdictions 

  

revenue included 70 million and 40 million of unfavorable foreign currency impact during 2019 and 2018  respectively resulting from changes in the us dollar net earnings attributable to fis common stockholders included 2 million and 12 million of unfavorable foreign currency impact during 2019 and 2018  respectively resulting from changes in the us dollar for the full year of 2020 we do not expect a material impact to revenue due to foreign currency translation although the actual amount of impact is uncertain due to the many factors that affect exchange rates 

our foreign exchange risk management policy permits the use of derivative instruments such as forward contracts and options to reduce volatility in our results of operations andor cash flows resulting from foreign exchange rate fluctuations we do not enter into foreign currency derivative instruments for trading purposes or to engage in speculative activity we periodically enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge foreign currency exposure to intercompany loans and other balance sheet items during the second quarter of 2019 we entered into foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the volatility in the companys cash flows due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations during the period leading up to the companys euro and pound sterlingdenominated debt issuances related to the worldpay acquisition as discussed in note 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements the company also utilizes foreign currency denominated debt and crosscurrency interest rate swaps designated as net investment hedges in order to reduce the volatility of the net investment value of certain of its euro and pound sterling functional subsidiaries see note 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements

competition 

the markets for our solutions and services are intensely competitive depending on the business line in both our ifs and gfs segments our primary competitors include internal technology departments within financial institutions retailers data processing or software development departments of large companies or large computer manufacturers companies that deliver software and integrated services to the financial services industry thirdparty payment processors securities exchanges asset managers card associations clearing networks or associations trust companies independent computer services firms companies that develop and deploy software applications companies owned by global banks selling new competitive solutions companies that provide customized development implementation and support services disruptive technology innovators and business process outsourcing companies many of these companies compete with us across multiple solutions markets and geographies some of these competitors possess greater financial sales and marketing resources than we do competitive factors impacting the success of our services across our segments include the quality of the technologybased application or service application features and functions ease of delivery and integration the ability to maintain enhance and support the applications or services price and overall relationship management we believe we compete favorably in each of these categories in addition we believe our financial services industry expertise combined with our ability to offer multiple applications services and integrated solutions to individual clients enhances our competitiveness against companies with more limited offerings 

research and development 

our research and development activities have related primarily to the modernization of our proprietary core systems design and development of next generation digital and innovative solutions and development of processing systems and related software applications and risk management platforms we expect to continue our practice of investing an appropriate level of resources to maintain enhance and extend the functionality of our proprietary systems and existing software applications to develop new and innovative software applications and systems to address emerging technology trends in response to the needs of our clients and to enhance the capabilities of our outsourcing infrastructure in addition we intend to offer services compatible with new and emerging delivery channels

as part of our research and development process we evaluate current and emerging technology for compatibility with our existing and future software platforms to this end we engage with various hardware and software vendors in evaluation of various infrastructure components where appropriate we use thirdparty technology components in the development of our software applications and service offerings in the case of nearly all of our thirdparty software enterprise license agreements exist for the thirdparty component and either alternative suppliers exist or transfer rights exist to ensure the continuity of supply as a result we are not materially dependent upon any thirdparty technology components thirdparty software may be used for highly specialized business functions which we may not be able to develop internally within time and budget constraints additionally thirdparty software may be used for commoditytype functions within a technology platform environment we work with our clients to determine the appropriate timing and approach to introducing technology or infrastructure changes to our applications and services during the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  approximately 3 to 4 of revenues were noncapitalizable research and development expense 

government regulation

our usbased wealth and retirement businesses held charters in 2018 in the states of georgia and delaware which made us subject to the regulatory compliance requirements of the georgia department of banking and finance and the state of delaware office of the state bank commissioner as a result we are also authorized to provide trust services in various additional states subject to additional applicable state regulations we divested reliance trust company of delaware effective december 31 2018 which was our only charter in delaware

our financial institution clients operating in the united states are required to comply with privacy regulations imposed under the grammleachbliley act referred to as glba and numerous similar state laws glba and those state laws place restrictions on the use of nonpublic personal information all financial institutions must disclose detailed privacy policies to their customers and offer them the opportunity to direct the financial institution not to share information with third parties the regulations under glba however permit financial institutions to share information with nonaffiliated parties who perform services for the financial institutions as a provider of services to financial institutions we are required to comply with the privacy laws and are bound by the same limitations on disclosure of the information received from our clients as apply to the financial institutions themselves a determination that there have been violations of privacy laws could expose us to significant damage awards fines and other penalties that could individually or in the aggregate materially harm our business and reputation 

in july 2016 the european commission formally approved and adopted the euus privacy shield providing a compliance framework for organizations to transfer personal data regarding citizens of the european union the eu to the us while we have certified certain lines of business under the privacy shield we have chosen to adopt eu model clauses published by the european commission as the primary basis for the export of data from the eu to the us 

new and proposed data protection legislation and regulations also significantly affect our business the general data protection regulation gdpr which became effective on may 25 2018 imposes a strict data compliance regime and extends the scope of the eu data protection law to all foreign companies processing data of eu residents we have amended thousands of client and vendor contracts and put into place a thorough compliance program to comply with this new comprehensive privacy law although the gdpr applies across the eu without a need for local 

 9 

implementing legislation as has been the case under the current data protection regime local data protection authorities dpas will still have the ability to interpret the gdpr which has the potential to create inconsistencies on a countr ybycountry basis the company will also be subject to the california consumer privacy act ccpa which comes into effect on january 1 2020 and provides california residents additional data protection rights including the right to be informed about the personal information collected by third parties and the use of that personal data further certain operations of the company will be subject to the brazil general personal data protection act which is also scheduled to become effective in 2020 the  company has adopted a comprehensive global privacy program to assess and manage these evolving risks 

 

we are also subject to certain economic and trade sanctions programs that are administered by the us treasury’s office of foreign assets control referred to as ofac which prohibit or restrict transactions to or from or dealings with specified countries their governments and in certain circumstances their nationals and with individuals and entities that are speciallydesignated nationals of those countries narcotics traffickers and terrorists or terrorist organizations similar antimoney laundering laws apply to movements of currency and payments through electronic transactions and to dealings with persons specified in lists maintained by the country equivalents to ofac in several other countries we have implemented policies procedures and internal controls that are designed to comply with the regulations and economic sanctions programs administered by ofac outside the us applicable laws rules and regulations similarly require designated types of financial institutions to implement antimoney laundering programs we have implemented policies procedures and internal controls that are designed to comply with all applicable antimoney laundering laws and regulations

 10 

 

the foregoing list of laws and regulations to which our company is subject is not exhaustive and the regulatory framework governing our operations changes continuously enactment of new laws and regulations may increasingly affect the operations of our business directly and indirectly which could result in substantial regulatory compliance costs litigation expense adverse publicity andor loss of revenue 

information security 

globally attacks on information technology systems continue to grow in frequency complexity and sophistication this is a trend we expect to continue such attacks have become a point of focus for individuals businesses and governmental entities the objectives of these attacks include among other things gaining unauthorized access to systems to facilitate financial fraud disrupt operations cause denial of service events corrupt data and steal nonpublic information these circumstances present both a threat and an opportunity for fis as part of our business we electronically receive process store and transmit a wide range of confidential information including sensitive customer information and personal consumer data we also operate payment cash access and prepaid card systems 

fis remains focused on making strategic investments in information security to protect our clients and our information systems this includes both capital expenditures and operating expenses on hardware software personnel and consulting services we also participate in industry and governmental initiatives to improve information security for our clients through the expertise we have gained with this ongoing focus and involvement we have developed fraud security risk management and compliance solutions to target this growth opportunity in the financial services industry

risk factors 

tableend 

in addition to the normal risks of business we are subject to significant risks and uncertainties including those listed below and others described elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k any of the risks described herein could result in a significant adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

 11 

risks related to our business and operations 

security breaches or attacks or our failure to comply with information security laws or regulations or industry security requirements could harm our business by disrupting our delivery of services and damaging our reputation and could result in a breach of one or more client contracts 

we electronically receive process store and transmit sensitive business information of our clients in addition we collect personal consumer data such as names and addresses social security numbers drivers license numbers cardholder data and payment history records such information is necessary to support our clients’ transaction processing and to conduct our check authorization and collection businesses the uninterrupted operation of our information systems as well as the confidentiality of the customerconsumer information that resides on such systems is critical to our successful operation for that reason cybersecurity is one of the principal operational risks we face as a provider of services to financial institutions if we fail to maintain an adequate security infrastructure adapt to emerging security threats or implement sufficient security standards and technology to protect against security breaches the confidentiality of the information we secure could be compromised unauthorized access to our computer systems or databases could result in the theft or publication of confidential information the deletion or modification of records damages from legal actions from clients andor their customers or otherwise cause interruptions in our operations and damage to our reputation these risks are greater with increased information transmission over the internet and the increasing level of sophistication posed by cyber criminals 

as a provider of services to financial institutions and a provider of card processing services we are bound by the same limitations on disclosure of the information we receive from our clients as apply to the clients themselves if we fail to comply with these regulations and industry security requirements we could be exposed to damages from legal actions from clients andor their customers governmental proceedings governmental notice requirements and the imposition of fines or prohibitions on card processing services in addition if more restrictive privacy laws rules or industry security requirements are adopted in the future on the federal or state level or by a specific industry body they could have an adverse impact on us through increased costs or restrictions on business processes any inability to prevent security or privacy breaches or the perception that such breaches may occur could cause our existing clients to lose confidence in our systems and terminate their agreements with us inhibit our ability to attract new clients result in increasing regulation or bring about other adverse consequences from the government agencies that regulate our business 

entity mergers or consolidations and business failures in the banking and financial services industry could adversely affect our business by eliminating some of our existing and potential clients and making us more dependent on a more limited number of clients 

there has been and continues to be substantial consolidation activity in the banking and financial services industry in addition certain financial institutions that experienced negative operating results including some of our clients have failed these consolidations and failures reduce our number of potential clients and may reduce our number of existing clients which could adversely affect our revenues even if the events do not reduce the aggregate activities of the consolidated entities further if our clients fail andor merge with or are acquired by other entities that are not our clients or that use fewer of our services they may discontinue or reduce use of our services it is also possible that larger financial institutions resulting from consolidations would have greater leverage in negotiating terms or could decide to perform inhouse some or all of the services we currently provide or could provide any of these developments could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

if we fail to innovate or adapt our services to changes in technology or in the marketplace or if our ongoing efforts to upgrade our technology are not successful we could lose clients or our clients could lose customers and we could have difficulty attracting new clients for our services 

the markets for our services are characterized by constant technological changes frequent introductions of new services and evolving industry standards our future success will be significantly affected by our ability to enhance our current solutions and develop and introduce new solutions and services that address the increasingly sophisticated needs of our clients and their customers in addition as more of our revenue and market demand shifts to software as a service saas business process as a service bpaas cloud and new disruptive technologies the need to keep pace with rapid technology changes becomes more acute these initiatives carry the risks associated with any new solution development effort including cost overruns delays in delivery and performance issues there can be no assurance that we will be successful in developing marketing and selling new solutions or enhancements that meet these changing demands that we will not experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development introduction and marketing of these solutions or enhancements or that our new solutions and enhancements will adequately meet the demands of the marketplace and achieve market acceptance any of these developments could have an adverse impact on our future revenues andor business prospects 

 12 

we operate in a competitive business environment and if we are unable to compete effectively our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 

the market for our services is intensely competitive our competitors vary in size and in the scope and breadth of the solutions and services they offer some of our competitors have substantial resources we face direct competition from third parties and since many of our larger potential clients have historically developed their key applications inhouse and therefore view their system requirements from a makeversusbuy perspective we also often compete against our potential clients’ inhouse capacities in addition the markets in which we compete have recently attracted increasing competition from smaller startups with disruptive technologies which are receiving increasing investments global banks and businesses controlled by combinations of global banks and global internet companies that are introducing competitive products and services into the marketplace particularly in the payments area emerging technologies and increased competition may also have the effect of unbundling bank solutions and result in picking off solutions we are currently providing from our legacy systems international competitors are also now targeting and entering the us market with greater force there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors or that the competitive pressures we face in the markets in which we operate will not materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations see item 1 business competition 

global economic political and other conditions including business cycles and consumer confidence may adversely affect our clients or trends in consumer spending which may adversely impact the demand for our services and our revenue and profitability 

a significant portion of our revenue is derived from transaction processing fees the global transaction processing industries depend heavily upon the overall level of consumer business and government spending any change in economic factors including a sustained deterioration in general economic conditions or consumer confidence particularly in the united states or increases in interest rates in key countries in which we operate may adversely affect consumer spending including related consumer debt further reduce check writing and change credit and debit card usage and as a result adversely affect our financial performance by reducing the number or average purchase amount of transactions that we service 

when there is a slowdown or downturn in the economy a drop in stock market levels or trading volumes or an event that disrupts the financial markets our business and financial results particularly with respect to our capital markets businesses may suffer for a number of reasons customers may react to worsening conditions by reducing their capital expenditures in general or by specifically reducing their information technology spending in addition customers may curtail or discontinue trading operations delay or cancel information technology projects or seek to lower their costs by renegotiating vendor contracts moreover competitors may respond to market conditions by lowering prices and attempting to lure away our customers to lower cost solutions any more protective trade policies or actions taken by the us may also result in other countries reducing or making more expensive services permitted to be provided by us based companies if any of these circumstances remain in effect for an extended period of time there could be a material adverse effect on our financial results 

constraints within global financial markets or international regulatory requirements could constrain our financial institution clients ability to purchase our services impacting our future growth and profitability 

a significant number of our clients and potential clients may hold sovereign debt of economically struggling nations or be subject to international banking regulatory requirements such as basel iii and a set of further reforms known as basel iv scheduled to be phased in commencing in january 2022 which may require changes in their capitalization and hence the amount of their working capital available to purchase our services these potential constraints could alter the ability of clients or potential clients to purchase our services and thus could have a significant impact on our future growth and profitability 

the sales and implementation cycles for many of our software and service offerings can be lengthy and require significant investment from both our clients and fis if we fail to close sales or if a client chooses not to complete an installation after expending significant time and resources to do so our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 

the sales and associated deployment of many of our software or service offerings often involve significant capital commitments by our clients andor fis potential clients generally commit significant resources to an evaluation of available software and services and require us to expend substantial time effort and money educating them prior to sales further as part of the sale or deployment of our software and services clients may also require fis to perform significant related services to complete a proof of concept or custom development to meet their needs all of the aforementioned activities may require the expenditure of significant funds and management resources and ultimately the client may determine not to close the sale or 

 13 

complete the implementation if we are unsuccessful in closing sales or if the client decides not to complete an implementation after we expend significant funds and management resources or we experience delays it could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our results may fluctuate from period to period because of the lengthy and unpredictable sales cycle for our software changes in our mix of licenses and services activity by competitors and customer budgeting operational requirements or renewal cycles 

particularly with respect to our gfs segment our operating results may fluctuate from period to period and be difficult to predict in a particular period due to the timing and magnitude of software license sales and other factors we offer a number of our software solutions on a license basis which means that the customer has the right to run the software on its own or a third party’s hardware we generally recognize license revenue when the license contract is signed the software is delivered and the term has begun the value of the license often depends on a number of customerspecific factors such as the number of customer locations users or accounts the sales cycle for a software license may be lengthy and take unexpected turns thus it is difficult to predict when software sales will occur or how much revenue they will generate because there are few incremental costs associated with software sales our operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year due to the timing and magnitude of software sales our results may also vary as a result of pricing pressures increased cost of equipment the evolving and unpredictable markets in which our solutions and services are sold changes in accounting principles and competitors’ new solutions or services 

in addition there are a number of other factors that could cause our sales and results of operation to fluctuate from period to period including the following 

  

 

failure to obtain new clients or renew client contracts on favorable terms could adversely affect results of operations and financial condition 

we may face pricing pressure in obtaining and retaining our clients larger clients may be able to seek price reductions from us when they renew a contract when a contract is extended or when the clients business has significant volume changes they may also reduce services if they decide to move services inhouse further our smaller and midsize clients may also exert pricing pressure particularly on renewal due to pricing competition or other economic needs or pressures being experienced by the client on some occasions this pricing pressure results in lower revenue from a client than we had anticipated based on our previous agreement with that client this reduction in revenue could result in an adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

further failure to renew client contracts on favorable terms could have an adverse effect on our business our contracts with clients generally run for several years and include liquidated damage provisions that provide for early termination fees terms are generally renegotiated prior to the end of a contracts term if we are not successful in achieving a high rate of contract renewals on favorable terms our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

our business and operating results could be adversely affected if we experience business interruptions errors or failure in connection with our or thirdparty information technology and communication systems and other software and hardware used in connection with our business if we experience defects or design errors in the software solutions we offer or more generally if the thirdparty vendors we rely upon are unwilling or unable to provide the services we need to effectively operate our business 

many of our services including our transformation services are based on sophisticated software and computing systems and we may encounter delays when developing new technology solutions and services further the technology solutions underlying our services have occasionally contained and may in the future contain undetected errors or defects when first introduced or when new versions are released in addition we may experience difficulties in installing or integrating our 

 14 

technologies on platforms used by our clients or our clients may cancel a project after we have expended significant effort and resources to complete an installation finally our systems and operations could be exposed to damage or interruption from fire natural disaster power loss telecommunications failure unauthorized entry and computer viruses defects in our technology solutions errors or delays in the processing of electronic transactions or other difficulties could result in i interruption of business operations ii delay in market acceptance iii additional development and remediation costs iv diversion of technical and other resources v loss of clients vi negative publicity or vii exposure to liability claims any one or more of the foregoing could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations although we attempt to limit our potential liability through controls including system redundancies security controls application development and testing controls and disclaimers and limitationofliability provisions in our license and client agreements we cannot be certain that these measures will always be successful in preventing disruption or limiting our liability 

further most of the solutions we offer are very complex software systems that are regularly updated no matter how careful the design and development complex software often contains errors and defects when first introduced and when major new updates or enhancements are released if errors or defects are discovered in current or future solutions we may not be able to correct them in a timely manner if at all in our development of updates and enhancements to our software solutions we may make a major design error that makes the solution operate incorrectly or less efficiently the failure of software to properly perform could result in the company and its clients being subjected to losses or liability including censures fines or other sanctions by the applicable regulatory authorities and we could be liable to parties who are financially harmed by those errors in addition such errors could cause the company to lose revenues lose clients or damage its reputation 

in addition we generally depend on a number of third parties both in the united states and internationally to supply elements of our systems computers research and market data connectivity communication network infrastructure other equipment and related support and maintenance we cannot be certain that any of these third parties will be able to continue providing these services to effectively meet our evolving needs if our vendors or in certain cases vendors of our customers fail to meet their obligations provide poor or untimely service or we are unable to make alternative arrangements for the provision of these services we may in turn fail to provide our services or to meet our obligations to our customers and our business financial condition and operating results could be materially harmed 

  

the doddfrank act the cfpb and state regulatory authorities such as the new york state department of financial services may result in business changes for certain of our businesses and clients that have or could have an adverse effect on our financial condition revenues results of operations or prospects for future growth and overall business 

the doddfrank act represented a comprehensive overhaul of the regulations governing the financial services industry within the united states the doddfrank act established the cfpb and provided the cfpb with rulemaking authority with respect to certain federal consumer protection statutes as well as examination and supervisory authority over consumer reporting agencies including chexsystems 

the cfpb continues to establish rules and regulations for regulating financial and nonfinancial institutions and providers to those institutions to ensure adequate protection of consumer privacy and to ensure consumers are not impacted by deceptive business practices these rules and regulations govern our clients or potential clients and also govern certain of our businesses these regulations have resulted and may further result in the need for fis to make capital investments to modify our solutions and services to facilitate our clients and potential clients compliance as well as to deploy additional processes or reporting to comply with these regulations in the future we may be subject to additional expense to ensure continued compliance with applicable laws and regulations and to investigate defend andor remedy actual or alleged violations further requirements of the regulations have resulted and could further result in changes in our business practices our clients business practices and those of other marketplace participants that may alter the delivery of services to consumers which have impacted or could further impact the demand for our software and services as well as alter the type or volume of transactions that we process on behalf of our clients as a result these requirements or proposed or future requirements could have an adverse impact on our financial condition revenues results of operations prospects for future growth and overall business 

the new york department of financial services has enacted new rules that require covered financial institutions to establish and maintain cybersecurity programs the impact of these rules and any future rules may require fis to be subject to additional regulation and adopt additional business practices that could require additional capital expenditures or impact our operating results changes to state money transmission laws and regulations including changing interpretations and the implementation of new or varying regulatory requirements may result in the need for additional money transmitter licenses these changes could result in increased costs of compliance as well as fines or penalties 

 15 

many of our clients are subject to a regulatory environment and to industry standards that may change in a manner that reduces the types or volume of solutions or services we provide or may reduce the type or number of transactions in which our clients engage and therefore reduce our revenues 

our clients are subject to a number of government regulations and industry standards with which our services must comply our clients must ensure that our services and related solutions work within the extensive and evolving regulatory and industry requirements applicable to them federal state foreign or industry authorities could adopt laws rules or regulations affecting our clients businesses that could lead to increased operating costs and could reduce the convenience and functionality of our services possibly resulting in reduced market acceptance in addition action by regulatory authorities relating to credit availability data usage privacy or other related regulatory developments could have an adverse effect on our clients and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition revenues results of operations prospects for future growth and overall business elimination of regulatory requirements could also adversely affect the sales of our solutions designed to help clients comply with complex regulatory environments 

our revenues from the sale of services to members of visa mastercard american express discover and other similar organizations are dependent upon our continued certification and sponsorship and the loss or suspension of certification or sponsorship could adversely affect our business 

in order to provide our card processing services we must be certified including applicable sponsorship by visa mastercard american express discover and other similar organizations these certifications are dependent upon our continued adherence to the standards of the issuing bodies and sponsoring member banks the member financial institutions some of which are our competitors set the standards with which we must comply if we fail to comply with these standards we could be fined our certifications could be suspended or our registration could be terminated the suspension or termination of our certifications or any changes in the rules and regulations governing visa mastercard american express discover or other similar organizations could result in a reduction in revenue or increased costs of operation which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business 

changes in card association and debit network fees or products could increase costs or otherwise limit our operations 

from time to time card associations and debit networks increase the interchange fees that they charge it is possible that competitive pressures will result in our absorption of a portion of such increases in the future which would increase our operating costs reduce our profit margin and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations furthermore the rules and regulations of the various card associations and networks prescribe certain capital requirements any increase in the capital level required would further limit our use of capital for other purposes 

interchange fees and related practices have been receiving significant legal and regulatory scrutiny worldwide the resulting regulatory changes that could occur from proposed regulations could alter the fees charged by card associations and debit networks worldwide such changes could have an adverse impact on our business or financial condition due to reductions or changes in types of transactions processed on behalf of our clients 

our securities brokerage operations are highly regulated and subject to risks that are not encountered in our other businesses 

one of our subsidiaries is an sec registered brokerdealer in the us and others are authorized by the fca to conduct certain regulated business in the uk domestic and foreign regulatory and selfregulatory organizations such as the sec finra and the fca can among other things fine censure issue ceaseanddesist orders against and suspend or expel a brokerdealer or its officers or employees for failure to comply with the many laws and regulations that govern brokerage activities those laws and regulations derive from a variety of policy considerations and address a wide range of topics including those designed to protect customers of brokerdealers and the privacy of their information and those designed to protect the integrity of the markets such as laws and regulations requiring brokerdealers to report suspicious activity of customers sanctions for failure to comply with such laws and regulations may arise out of currentlyconducted activities or those conducted in prior periods our ability to comply with these laws and regulations is largely dependent on our establishment maintenance and enforcement of an effective brokerage compliance program failure to establish maintain and enforce the required brokerage compliance procedures even if unintentional could subject us to significant losses lead to disciplinary or other actions and tarnish our reputation regulations affecting the brokerage industry may change which could adversely affect our financial results 

we are exposed to certain risks relating to the execution services provided by our brokerage operations to our customers and counterparties which include other brokerdealers active traders hedge funds asset managers and other institutional and 

 16 

noninstitutional clients these risks include but are not limited to customers or counterparties failing to pay for or deliver securities trading errors the inability or failure to settle trades and trade execution system failures as trading in the us securities markets has become more automated the potential impact of a trading error or a rapid series of errors caused by a computer or human error or a malicious act has become greater in our other businesses we generally can disclaim liability for trading losses that may be caused by our software but in our brokerage operations we may not be able to limit our liability for trading losses or failed trades even when we are not at fault as a result we may suffer losses that are disproportionately large compared to the relatively modest profit contributions of our brokerage operations 

privacy laws and regulations such as the gdpr require fis to adopt new business practices and contractual provisions in existing and new contracts which may require transitional and incremental expenses which may impact our future operating results 

new privacy laws such as the gdpr in the eu continue to develop in ways we cannot predict privacy laws may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to country and impose inconsistent or conflicting requirements complying with varying jurisdictional requirements could increase the costs and complexity of compliance and associated recordkeeping costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business violations of privacy laws can result in significant penalties and damage to our brand and business 

implementation of the gdpr has required changes to certain of our business practices thereby increasing our costs we ha ve put into place a thorough compliance program to comply with the known obligations under the gdpr and have performed data protection impact assessments for our businesses that are in scope and have executed data protection agreements with the clients and vendors of those businesses if certain of our clients and vendors fail to recognize the importance andor applicability of these requirements and do not respond to our request for such amendments both parties may be subject to penalties and fines for noncompliance failure to comply with the requirements of the gdpr could result in significant penalties and loss of business among other things 

new privacy laws in california and brazil are expected to issue clarifying regulations prior to becoming effective in 2020 so we will continue to have uncertainties about what we will be expected to comply with these laws until they are issued including the costs and efforts of compliance there are also several additional privacy laws being considered by state legislatures the federal legislature and countries around the world so a more substantial compliance effort with varying regimes in different jurisdictions is considered probable in the future which will increase the costs and complexities of our business 

if we fail to comply with applicable regulations or to meet regulatory expectations our business results of operations or financial condition could be adversely impacted 

the majority of our data processing services for financial institutions are not directly subject to federal or state regulations specifically applicable to financial institutions such as banks thrifts and credit unions however as a provider of services to these financial institutions our data processing operations are examined on a regular basis by various federal and state regulatory authorities and by international regulatory authorities such as the fca in certain jurisdictions if we fail to comply with any applicable regulations or guidelines for operations of a data services provider we could be subject to regulatory actions or rating changes may not meet contractual obligations and may suffer harm to our client relationships or reputation failure to meet the aforementioned requirements or to adapt to new requirements at the federal state or international level could inhibit our ability to retain existing clients or obtain new clients which could have an adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition 

in addition to our data processing services described above we also have business operations that store process or transmit consumer information or have direct relationships with consumers that are obligated to comply with regulations including but not limited to the federal fair credit reporting act the federal fair debt collection practices act and applicable privacy requirements further our international businesses must comply with applicable laws such as the us foreign corrupt practices act failure to maintain compliance with or adapt to changes in any of the aforementioned requirements could result in fines penalties or regulatory actions that could have an adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition 

high profile payment card industry or digital banking security breaches could impact consumer payment behavior patterns in the future and reduce our card payment transaction volumes 

  we are unable to predict whether or when high profile card payment or digital banking security breaches will occur and if they occur whether consumers will transact less on their payment cards or reduce their digital banking service if consumers 

 17 

transact less on cards issued by our clients or reduce digital banking services and we are not able to adapt to offer our clients alternative technologies it could have a significant adverse impact on our revenue and related earnings 

misappropriation of our intellectual property and proprietary rights or a finding that our patents are invalid could impair our competitive position 

our ability to compete depends in some part upon our proprietary solutions and technology despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our services or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary or challenge the validity of our patents with governmental authorities policing unauthorized use of our proprietary rights is difficult we cannot make any assurances that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of technology or that the agreements entered into for that purpose will be enforceable effective patent trademark service mark copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our applications and services are made available online misappropriation of our intellectual property or potential litigation concerning such matters could have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 

if our applications or services are found to infringe the proprietary rights of others we may be required to change our business practices and may also become subject to significant costs and monetary penalties 

as our information technology applications and services develop we are increasingly subject to infringement claims any claims whether with or without merit could i be expensive and timeconsuming to defend ii result in an injunction or other equitable relief which could cause us to cease making licensing or using applications that incorporate the challenged intellectual property iii require us to redesign our applications if feasible iv divert management’s attention and resources and v require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements in order to obtain the right to use necessary technologies or pay damages resulting from any infringing use 

some of our solutions contain open source software and any failure to comply with the terms of one or more of these open source licenses could negatively affect our business 

we use a limited amount of software licensed by its authors or other third parties under socalled open source licenses and may continue to use such software in the future some of these licenses contain requirements that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the open source software and that we license such modifications or derivative works under the terms of a particular open source license or other license granting third parties certain rights of further use by the terms of certain open source licenses we could be required to release the source code of our proprietary software if we combine our proprietary software with open source software in a certain manner additionally the terms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by united states or other courts and there is a risk that these licenses could be construed in a manner that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our solutions in addition to risks related to license requirements usage of open source software can lead to greater risks than use of thirdparty commercial software as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on origin of the software we have established processes to help alleviate these risks including a review process for screening requests from our development organizations for the use of open source but we cannot be sure that all open source is submitted for approval prior to use in our solutions in addition many of the risks associated with usage of open source cannot be eliminated and could if not properly addressed negatively affect our business 

lack of system integrity fraudulent payments credit quality and undetected errors related to funds settlement or the availability of clearing services could result in a financial loss 

we settle funds on behalf of financial institutions other businesses and consumers and receive funds from clients card issuers payment networks and consumers on a daily basis for a variety of transaction types transactions facilitated by us include debit card credit card electronic bill payment transactions banking payments and check clearing that supports consumers financial institutions and other businesses these payment activities rely upon the technology infrastructure that facilitates the verification of activity with counterparties the facilitation of the payment as well as the detection or prevention of fraudulent payments if our continuity of operations integrity of processing or ability to detect or prevent fraudulent payments were compromised this could result in a financial loss to us in addition we rely on various financial institutions to provide ach services in support of funds settlement for certain of our solutions if we are unable to obtain such ach services in the future that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations in addition we may issue credit to consumers financial institutions or other businesses as part of the funds settlement a default on this credit by a counterparty could result in a financial loss to us furthermore if one of our clients for which we facilitate settlement suffers a fraudulent event due to an error of their controls we may suffer a financial loss if the client does not have sufficient capital to cover the loss

the referendum on the united kingdom’s membership in the european union could cause disruption to and create uncertainty surrounding our business 

the referendum on the united kingdom’s membership in the european union referred to as brexit approving the exit of the united kingdom from the european union could cause disruptions to and create uncertainty surrounding our business including affecting our relationships with our existing and future clients suppliers and employees which could have an adverse effect on our business financial results and operations the effects of brexit will depend on the agreements if any the uk makes with the eu to retain access to eu markets at the time brexit takes effect march 29 2019 if not suspendeddelayed during a transitional period or more permanently in addition because the terms of trade between the uk and jurisdictions other than the eu may be currently governed by trade agreements between the eu and such other jurisdictions the uk may be required to negotiate new terms of trade with such other jurisdictions these potential measures could disrupt the markets we serve and the tax jurisdictions in which we operate and adversely change tax benefits or liabilities in these or other jurisdictions and may cause us to lose clients suppliers and employees in addition brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the uk determines which eu laws to replace or replicate 

actions to implement brexit may also create global economic uncertainty which may cause our clients to closely monitor their costs and reduce their spending on our solutions and services 

any of these effects of brexit among others could materially adversely affect our business business opportunities results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

failure to properly manage or mitigate risks in the operation of our wealth and retirement businesses in the us and the uk could have adverse liability consequences 

 we have wealth and retirement businesses in the us and uk engaged in processing securities transactions on behalf of clients and serving as a custodian failure to properly manage or mitigate risks in those operations and increased volatility in the financial markets may increase the potential for and magnitude of resulting losses including those that may arise from human errors or omissions defects or interruptions in computer or communications systems or breakdowns in processes or in internal controls human errors or omissions may include failures to comply with applicable laws or corporate policies and procedures theft fraud or misappropriation of assets whether arising from the intentional actions of internal personnel or external third parties     in addition the usbased business holds charters in the states of georgia and delaware which exposes us to further regulatory compliance requirements of the georgia department of banking and finance and the office of the commissioner of banking in the state of delaware the us wealth and retirement business is required to hold certain levels of regulatory capital as defined by the state banking regulators in the states in which it holds a bank or trust charter delaware and georgia in the uk our platform securities and brokerdealer businesses are regulated by the fca and are subject to further regulatory capital requireme nts one consequence of brexit may be that the loss of the ability to “passport” regulated business from the uk to the eu may result in our having to add operations of the business in a country in the eu that may subject us to further regulatory requirements and costs in that country 

our business is subject to the risks of international operations including movements in foreign currency exchange rates 

the international operations of fis represented approximately 26  of our total 2018 revenues and are largely conducted in currencies other than the us dollar including the british pound brazilian real euro and indian rupee our business and financial results could be adversely affected due to a variety of factors including the following 

 • unexpected or unfavorable changes in foreign laws regulatory requirements and related interpretations 

• difficulty of effective enforcement of contractual provisions in local jurisdictions 

• inadequate intellectual property protection in foreign countries 



 19 

 control regulations particularly in emerging markets 

in foreign countries particularly in those with developing economies certain business practices may exist that are prohibited by laws and regulations applicable to us such as the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and other anticorruption laws although our policies and procedures require compliance with these laws and are designed to facilitate compliance with these laws our employees contractors and agents may take actions in violation of applicable laws or our policies any such violation even if prohibited by our policies could have a material adverse effect on our business and 

reputation 

as we expand our international operations more of our clients may pay us in foreign currencies conducting business in currencies other than us dollars subjects us to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that can negatively impact our results period to period including relative to analyst estimates or guidance our primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to foreign currencies in brazil europe including the united kingdom and parts of asia the us dollar value of our net investments in foreign operations the periodic conversion of foreigndenominated earnings to the us dollar our reporting currency and our results of operations and in some cases cash flows could be adversely affected in a material manner by movements in foreign currency exchange rates these risks could cause an adverse effect on the business financial position and results of operations of the company 

we have businesses in emerging markets that may experience significant economic volatility 

 we have operations in emerging markets primarily in brazil india southeast asia the middle east and africa these emerging market economies tend to be more volatile than the more established markets we serve in north america and europe which could add volatility to our future revenues and earnings 

failure to attract and retain skilled technical employees or senior management personnel could harm our ability to grow 

our future success depends upon our ability to attract and retain highlyskilled technical personnel because the development of our solutions and services requires knowledge of computer hardware operating system software system management software and application software our technical personnel must be proficient in a number of disciplines competition for such technical personnel is intense and our failure to hire and retain talented personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

our future growth will also require sales and marketing financial and administrative personnel to develop and support new solutions and services to enhance and support current solutions and services and to expand operational and financial systems there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain the necessary personnel to accomplish our growth strategies and we may experience constraints that could adversely affect our ability to satisfy client demand in a timely fashion 

our ability to maintain compliance with applicable laws rules and regulations and to manage and monitor the risks facing our business relies upon the ability to maintain skilled compliance security risk and audit professionals competition for such skillsets is intense and our failure to hire and retain talented personnel could have an adverse effect on our internal control environment and impact our operating results 

our senior management team has significant experience in the financial services industry and the loss of this leadership could have an adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition further the loss of this leadership may have an adverse impact on senior managements ability to provide effective oversight and strategic direction for all key functions within the company which could impact our future business operating results and financial condition 

we are the subject of various legal proceedings that could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability 

we are involved in various litigation matters including in some instances classaction cases and patent infringement litigation if we are unsuccessful in our defense of litigation matters we may be forced to pay damages andor change our business practices any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

  

 20 

unfavorable resolution of tax contingencies or unfavorable future tax law changes could adversely affect our tax expense 

our tax returns and positions are subject to review and audit by federal state local and international taxing authorities an unfavorable outcome to a tax audit could result in higher tax expense and could negatively impact our effective tax rate financial position results of operations and cash flows in the current andor future periods the us enacted significant tax reform in 2017 and certain provisions of the new law could have an adverse impact to us unfavorable future tax law changes could also result in negative impacts in addition taxlaw amendments in the united states and other jurisdictions could significantly impact how united states multinational corporations are taxed although we cannot predict whether or in what form such legislation will pass if enacted it could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 

a material weakness in our internal controls could have a material adverse effect on us 

effectiv e  internal controls are necessary for us to provide reasonable assurance with respect to our financial reports and to adequately mitigate risk of fraud if we cannot provide reasonable assurance with respect to our financial reports and adequately mitigate risk of fraud our reputation and operating results could be harmed internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations including the possibility of human error the circumvention or overriding of controls or fraud therefore even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements in addition projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

  

a material weakness is a deficiency or combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting could adversely impact our ability to provide timely and accurate financial information if we are unable to report financial information timely and accurately or to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures we could be subject to among other things regulatory or enforcement actions by the sec any one of which could adversely affect our business prospects 

risks related to business combinations and ventures 

strategic transactions including acquisitions and divestitures involve significant risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

strategic acquisitions and divestitures we have made in the past and may make in the future present significant risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows these risks include the following 



 21 

 

the future results of our brazilian operations may not meet our financial goals following the unwinding of the brazilian venture 

on december 31 2018 we closed a transaction with banco bradesco to unwind the brazilian venture under this agreement the brazilian venture spunoff certain assets of the business that also provide services to nonbradesco clients to a new whollyowned fis subsidiary the subsidiary entered into a longterm commercial agreement to provide current and new services to banco bradesco effective january 1 2019 that include software licensing maintenance application management card portfolio migration business process outsourcing fraud management and professional services as a result of the transaction banco bradesco owns 100 of the entity that previously housed the brazilian venture and its remaining assets that relate to card processing for banco bradesco which banco bradesco will perform internally the transaction is expected to result in an annualized reduction in fis’ reported revenue of approximately 225 million 

while fis expects the net earnings from nonbradesco customers and the current and new services provided to bradesco by fis to largely replace the net earnings lost from the unwinding of the brazilian venture no assurance can be made in this regard and fis may fail to meet its financial goals to grow the business following the closing of the transaction further it is possible that existing nonbradesco clients may reduce the amount of services we perform for them following the unwinding of the brazilian venture in addition the costs of operating in brazil on a standalone basis could be higher than we anticipate 

for further detail on our brazilian venture see note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

there could be significant liability for us if all or part of the as splitoff were determined to be taxable for us federal or state income tax purposes 

on march 31 2014 sungard completed the splitoff of its availability services as business to its existing stockholders including its private equity owners on a taxfree and prorata basis the “as splitoff” at the time sungard received opinions from outside tax counsel to the effect that the as splitoff should qualify for taxfree treatment as transactions described in section 355 and related provisions of the internal revenue code as amended the “code” in addition actions taken following the as splitoff including the sungard acquisition and certain 50 percent or greater changes by vote or value of the stock ownership of the new entity conducting the as business may cause the as splitoff to be taxable to fis in connection with the sungard acquisition we and sungard received opinions of outside tax counsel to the effect that the sungard acquisition should not cause the as splitoff to fail to so qualify 

notwithstanding the receipt of tax opinions the taxfree treatment of the as splitoff is not free from doubt and there is a risk that the internal revenue service the irs a state taxing authority or a court could conclude to the contrary that the separation of the as business from sungard may not qualify as taxfree transactions an opinion of tax counsel is not binding on the irs state taxing authorities or any court and as a result there can be no assurance that a tax authority will not challenge the taxfree treatment of all or part of the as splitoff or that if litigated a court would not agree with the irs or a state taxing authority further these tax opinions rely on certain facts assumptions representations warranties and covenants from sungard the new entity conducting the as business and from some of sungard’s stockholders regarding the past and future conduct of the companies’ respective businesses share ownership and other matters if any of the facts assumptions representations warranties and covenants on which the opinions rely is inaccurate or incomplete or not satisfied the opinions may no longer be valid moreover the irs or state taxing authority could determine on audit that the as splitoff is taxable if it determines that any of these facts assumptions representations warranties or covenants are not correct or have been violated or if it disagrees with one or more conclusions in the opinions or for other reasons 

if the as splitoff is determined to be taxable we and possibly our stockholders could incur significant income tax liabilities these tax liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 22 

actions taken by sungard availability services capital inc or its stockholders could cause the as splitoff to fail to qualify as a taxfree transaction and sungard availability services capital inc may be unable to fully indemnify sungard for the resulting significant tax liabilities 

pursuant to the tax sharing and disaffiliation agreement tax sharing agreement that sungard entered into with sungard availability services capital inc spinco spinco is required to indemnify sungard for certain taxes relating to the as splitoff that result from i any breach of the representations or the covenants made by spinco regarding the preservation of the intended taxfree treatment of the as splitoff ii any action or omission that is inconsistent with the representations statements warranties and covenants provided to tax counsel in connection with their delivery of tax opinions to sungard with respect to the as splitoff and iii any other action or omission that was likely to give rise to such taxes when taken in each case by spinco or any of its subsidiaries conversely if any such taxes are the result of such a breach or certain other actions or omissions by sungard sungard would be wholly responsible for such taxes in addition if any part of the as splitoff fails to qualify for the intended taxfree treatment for reasons other than those for which sungard or spinco would be wholly responsible pursuant to the provisions described above spinco will be obligated to indemnify sungard for 23 of the liability for taxes imposed in respect of the as splitoff and sungard would bear the remainder of such taxes if spinco is required to indemnify sungard for any of the foregoing reasons spinco’s indemnification liabilities could potentially exceed its net asset value and spinco may be unable to fully reimburse or indemnify sungard for its significant tax liabilities arising from the as splitoff as provided by the tax sharing agreement 

we have substantial investments in recorded goodwill and other intangible assets as a result of prior acquisitions and a severe or extended economic downturn could cause these investments to become impaired requiring writedowns that would reduce our operating income 

as of december 31 2018  goodwill aggregated to 135 billion  or 570  of total assets and other indefinitelived intangible assets aggregated to 43 million  or 02  of total assets current accounting rules require goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets to be assessed for impairment at least annually or whenever changes in circumstances indicate potential impairment factors that may be considered a change in circumstance include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results a significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization and negative industry or economic trends the results of our 2018 annual assessment of the recoverability of goodwill indicated that the fair values of the company’s reporting units were in excess of the carrying values of those reporting units and thus no goodwill impairment existed as of december 31 2018 likewise the fair value of indefinitelived intangible assets was also in excess of the carrying value of those assets as of december 31 2018 however if worldwide or united states economic conditions decline significantly with negative impacts to bank spending and consumer behavior  or if other business or market changes impact our outlook  the carrying amount of our goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets may no longer be recoverable and we may be required to record an impairment charge which would have a negative impact on our results of operations 

as of december 31 2018  intangible assets with finite useful lives aggregated to 3089 million  or 130  of total assets current accounting rules require intangible assets with finite useful lives to be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable factors that may be considered a change in circumstance include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results a significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization and negative industry or economic trends 

we will continue to monitor the fair value of our intangible assets as well as our market capitalization and the impact of any economic downturn on our business to determine if there is an impairment in future periods 

risks related to our indebtedness 

our existing debt levels and future levels under existing facilities and debt service requirements may adversely affect our financial condition or operational flexibility and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our outstanding indebtedness 

as of december 31 2018  we had total debt of approximately 90 billion  this level of debt or any increase in our debt level could have adverse consequences for our business financial condition operating results and operational flexibility including the following i the debt level may cause us to have difficulty borrowing money in the future for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions or other purposes ii our debt level may limit operational flexibility and our ability to pursue business opportunities and implement certain business strategies iii some of our debt has a variable rate of interest which exposes us to the risk of increased interest rates iv we have a higher level of debt than some of our competitors or potential 

 23 

competitors which may cause a competitive disadvantage and may reduce flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions including increased competition and vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  v there are significant maturities on our debt that we may not be able to repay at maturity or that may be refinanced at higher rates and vi  if we fail to satisfy our obligations under our outstanding debt or fail to comply with the financial or other restrictive covenants contained in the indenture governing our senior notes or our credit facility an event of default could result that could cause all of our debt to become due and payable 

we may be adversely affected by changes in libor reporting practices or the method in which libor is determined 

as of december 31 2018  we had outstanding approximately 208 million  of variable debt that was indexed to the london interbank offered rate libor on july 27 2017 the financial conduct authority the “fca” announced its intention to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for calibration of libor to the administrator of libor after 2021 it is not possible to predict the further effect of the rules or policies of the fca any changes in the methods by which libor is determined or any other reforms to libor that may be enacted in the united kingdom the european union or elsewhere any such developments may cause libor to perform differently than in the past or cease to exist in addition any other legal or regulatory changes made by the fca ice benchmark administration limited the european money markets institute formerly euriborebf the european commission or any other successor governance or oversight body or future changes adopted by such body in the method by which libor is determined or the transition from libor to a successor benchmark rate may result in among other things a sudden or prolonged increase or decrease in libor a delay in the publication of libor and changes in the rules or methodologies in libor which may discourage market participants from continuing to administer or to participate in libor’s determination and in certain situations could result in libor no longer being determined and published if a published us dollar libor rate is unavailable after 2021 the interest rates on our debt which is indexed to libor will be determined using various alternative methods any of which may result in interest obligations which are more than or do not otherwise correlate over time with the payments that would have been made on such debt if us dollar libor was available in its current form further the same costs and risks that may lead to the discontinuation or unavailability of us dollar libor may make one or more of the alternative methods impossible or impracticable to determine any of these proposals or consequences could have a material adverse effect on our financing costs 

rising interest rates could increase our borrowing costs 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our shortterm commercial paper borrowings revolving credit facility and interest rate derivatives in the future we may have additional borrowings under existing or new variablerate debt increases in interest rates on variablerate debt would increase our interest expense a rising interest rate environment could increase the cost of refinancing existing debt and incurring new debt which could have an adverse effect on our financing costs 

credit ratings if lowered below investment grade could adversely affect our cost of funds and liquidity 

the company maintains investment grade credit ratings from the major us rating agencies on its senior unsecured debt sp bbb moodys baa2 fitch bbb as well as its commercial paper program sp a2 moodys p2 fitch f2 failure to maintain investment grade rating levels could adversely affect the company’s cost of funds and liquidity and access to certain capital markets but would not have an adverse effect on the company’s ability to access its existing revolving credit facility

overview 

fis is a global leader in financial services technology providing solutions and services to clients in the retail and institutional banking payments capital markets asset management and wealth and retirement markets through the depth and breadth of our solutions portfolio global capabilities and domain expertise fis serves clients in over 130 countries headquartered in jacksonville florida fis employs more than 47000 people worldwide and holds leadership positions in payment processing financial software and banking solutions providing software services and outsourcing of the technology that empowers the financial world fis is a fortune 500 company and is a member of the standard  poor’s 500 ®  index 

we have grown organically as well as through acquisitions which have contributed critical applications and services that complement or enhance our existing offerings diversifying our revenue by customer geography and service offering we evaluate possible acquisitions that might contribute to our growth or performance on an ongoing basis 

  

       fis reports its financial performance based on three segments integrated financial solutions ifs global financial solutions gfs and corporate and other a description of these segments is included in note 19 to the notes to consolidated financial statements revenue by segment and the adjusted ebitda of our segments are discussed below in segment results of operations 

  

business trends and conditions 

our revenue is primarily derived from a combination of recurring technology and processing services professional services and software license fees the majority of our revenue has historically been recurring and has been provided under multiyear contracts that contribute relative stability to our revenue stream these services in general are considered critical to our clients operations a considerable portion of our recurring revenue is derived from transaction processing fees that fluctuate with the level of accounts and card transactions among other variable measures associated with consumer commercial and capital markets activity professional services revenue is typically nonrecurring and sales of software licenses are less predictable a portion of which can be regarded as discretionary spending by our clients 

we continue to assist financial institutions in migrating to outsourced integrated technology solutions to improve their profitability and address increasing and ongoing regulatory requirements as a provider of outsourcing solutions we benefit from multiyear recurring revenue streams which help moderate the effects of broader yeartoyear economic and market changes that otherwise might have a larger impact on our results of operations we believe our integrated solutions and outsourced services are well positioned to address this outsourcing trend across the markets we serve 

over the last three years we have moved approximately 50 of our server compute to our fis cloud located in our strategic data centers and our goal is to increase that percentage to 65 by the end of 2019 and 80 by the end of 2021 this allows us to further enhance security for our clients’ data and increases the flexibility and speed with which we can provide services and solutions to our clients eventually at lesser cost concurrently we have continued to consolidate our data centers closing 10 additional data centers in 2018 our consolidation has generated a savings for the company as of yearend 2018 exceeding 100 million in run rate annual expense reduction since the program’s inception in mid2016 we plan to close and consolidate approximately 20 more data centers by 2021 which should result in additional run rate annual expense reduction of about 150 million 

we continue to invest in modernization innovation and integrated solutions and services in order to meet the demands of the markets we serve and compete with global banks international providers and disruptive technology innovators we invest both organically and through investment opportunities in companies building complementary technologies in the financial services space our internal efforts in research and development activities have related primarily to the modernization of our proprietary core systems design and development of next generation digital and innovative solutions and development of 

 32 

processing systems and related software applications and risk management platforms we have increased our investments in these areas in each of the last three years we expect to continue our practice of investing an appropriate level of resources to maintain enhance and extend the functionality of our proprietary systems and existing software applications to develop new and innovative software applications and systems to address emerging technology trends in response to the needs of our clients and to enhance the capabilities of our outsourcing infrastructure 

  

consumer preference continues to shift from traditional branch banking services to digital banking solutions and our clients seek to provide a single integrated banking experience through their branch mobile internet and voice banking channels we have been providing our large regional banking customers in the us with digital one an integrated digital banking platform and are now adding functionality and offering digital one to our community bank clients to provide a consistent omnichannel experience for consumers of banking services across selfservice channels like mobile banking and online banking as well as supporting channels for bank staff operating in bank branches and contact centers the uniform customer experience will extend to support a broad range of financial services including opening new accounts servicing of existing accounts providing money movement services personal financial management as well as a broad range of other consumer small business and commercial banking capabilities digital one will be integrated into and will extend the core banking platforms offered by fis and will also be offered to customers of nonfis core banking systems 

  

we co ntinue to see demand for innovative solutions in the payments market that will deliver faster more convenient payment solutions in mobile channels internet applications and cards we believe digital payments will grow and partially replace existing payment tender volumes over time as consumers and merchants embrace the convenience incremental services and benefits additionally new formidable nontraditional payments competitors and large merchants are investing in and innovating digital payment technologies to address the emerging market opportunity and it is unclear the extent to which particular technologies or services will succeed we believe the growth of digital payments continues to present both an opportunity and a risk to us as the market develops although we cannot predict which digital payment technologies or solutions will be successful we cautiously believe our client relationships payments infrastructure and experience adapted solutions and emerging solutions are well positioned to maintain or grow our clients existing payment volumes which is our focus 

we anticipate consolidation within the banking industry will continue primarily in the form of merger and acquisition activity among financial institutions which we believe as a whole is detrimental to our business however consolidation resulting from specific merger and acquisition transactions may be beneficial to our business when consolidations of financial institutions occur merger partners often operate systems obtained from competing service providers the newly formed entity generally makes a determination to migrate its core and payments systems to a single platform when a financial institution processing client is involved in a consolidation we may benefit by their expanding the use of our services if such services are chosen to survive the consolidation and support the newly combined entity conversely we may lose revenue if we are providing services to both entities or if a client of ours is involved in a consolidation and our services are not chosen to survive the consolidation and support the newly combined entity it is also possible that larger financial institutions resulting from consolidation may have greater leverage in negotiating terms or could decide to perform inhouse some or all of the services that we currently provide or could provide we seek to mitigate the risks of consolidations by offering other competitive services to take advantage of specific opportunities at the surviving company 

in certain of the international markets in which we do business we continue to experience growth on a constant currency basis demand for our solutions may also continue to be driven in developing countries by governmentled financial inclusion policies aiming to reduce the unbanked population and by growth in the middle classes in these markets driving the need for more sophisticated banking solutions the majority of our international revenue is generated by clients in brazil the united kingdom germany canada and india for the full year of 2019 we anticipate an approximate 45 million adverse impact to revenue due to foreign currency translation although the actual amount of impact is uncertain due to the many factors that affect exchange rates 

  

on december 31 2018 fis closed the transaction we previously announced to unwind the brazilian venture with banco bradesco under this agreement the brazilian venture spunoff certain assets of the business that also provide services to nonbradesco clients to a new whollyowned fis subsidiary this subsidiary entered into a longterm commercial agreement to provide current and new services to banco bradesco effective january 1 2019 that include software licensing maintenance application management card portfolio migration business process outsourcing fraud management and professional services as a result of the transaction banco bradesco owns 100 of the entity that previously housed the brazilian venture and its remaining assets that relate to card processing for banco bradesco which banco bradesco will perform internally the transaction is expected to result in an annualized reduction in fis’ reported revenue of approximately 225 million in addition it resulted in impairment charges of 95 million in the third quarter of 2018 for further detail on our brazilian

venture see note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and item 1a risk factors  included elsewhere in this report 

globally attacks on information technology systems continue to grow in frequency complexity and sophistication this is a trend we expect to continue such attacks have become a point of focus for individuals businesses and governmental entities the objectives of these attacks include among other things gaining unauthorized access to systems to facilitate financial fraud disrupt operations cause denial of service events corrupt data and steal nonpublic information these circumstances present both a threat and an opportunity for fis as part of our business we electronically receive process store and transmit a wide range of confidential information including sensitive customer information and personal consumer data we also operate payment cash access and prepaid card systems 

fis remains focused on making strategic investments in information security to protect our clients and our information systems this includes both capital expenditures and operating expense on hardware software personnel and consulting services we also participate in industry and governmental initiatives to improve information security for our clients through the expertise we have gained with this ongoing focus and involvement we have developed fraud security risk management and compliance solutions to target this growth opportunity in the financial services industry 

as described in note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements on july 31 2017 we sold a majority interest in certain of our consulting businesses to affiliates of cdr these businesses had lower margins than many of our other businesses the consulting businesses sold were included within the gfs and ifs segments also on february 1 2017 we sold our pse business which had been included in our corporate and other segment these divestitures affect the comparability of our results of operations for the 2018 2017 and 2016 periods presented 

critical accounting policies 

the accounting policies described below are those we consider critical in preparing our consolidated financial statements these policies require management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures with respect to contingent liabilities and assets at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods actual amounts could differ from those estimates see note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a more detailed description of the significant accounting policies that have been followed in preparing our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

the company generates revenue in a number of ways including from the delivery of account or transactionbased processing saas bpaas cloud offerings software licensing softwarerelated services and professional services we are frequently a party to multiple concurrent contracts with the same client these situations require judgment to determine whether the individual contracts should be combined or evaluated separately for purposes of revenue recognition in making this determination we consider the timing of negotiating and executing the contracts whether the different elements of the contracts are negotiated as a package with a single commercial objective whether the solutions or services promised in the contracts are a single performance obligation and whether any of the payment terms of the contracts are interrelated our individual contracts also frequently include multiple promised solutions or services at contract inception we assess the solutions and services promised in our contracts with customers and identify a performance obligation for each promise to transfer to the customer a solution or service or bundle of solutions or services that is distinct  ie if a solution or service is separately identifiable from other items in the bundled package and if a customer can benefit from it on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the customer we must apply judgment in these circumstances in determining whether individual promised solutions or services can be considered distinct or should instead be combined with other promised solutions or services in the contract we recognize revenue when or as we satisfy a performance obligation by transferring control of a solution or service to a customer we must use judgment to determine the appropriate measure of progress for performance obligations satisfied over time and the timing of when the customer obtains control for performance obligations satisfied at a point in time judgment is also required in estimating and allocating variable consideration to one or more but not all performance obligations in a contract determining the standalone selling prices of each performance obligation and allocating the transaction price to each distinct performance obligation in a contract 

due to the large number broad nature and average size of individual contracts we are party to the impact of judgments and assumptions that we apply in recognizing revenue for any single contract is not likely to have a material effect on our consolidated operations or financial position however the broader accounting policy assumptions that we apply across similar contracts or classes of clients could significantly influence the timing and amount of revenue recognized in our historical and 

 34 

future results of operations or financial position additional information about our revenue recognition policies is included in note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

computer software 

computer software includes the fair value of software acquired in business combinations purchased software and capitalized software development costs purchased software is recorded at cost and amortized using the straightline method over its estimated useful life which is generally three to five years software acquired in business combinations is recorded at its fair value and amortized using straightline or accelerated methods over its estimated useful life which is three to 10 years as discussed below in the critical accounting policy section purchase accounting  as of december 31 2018  and 2017  computer software net of accumulated amortization was 18 billion  and 17 billion  respectively and amortization of computer software was 468 million  436 million  and 396 million  for the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively balances related to acquired software represent a significant portion of these balances particularly for the periods after the acquisition of sungard which resulted in acquired software of 674 million 

the capitalization of software development costs is governed by fasb asc subtopic 98520 if the software is to be sold leased or otherwise marketed or by fasb asc subtopic 35040 if the software is for internal use after the technological feasibility of the software has been established for software to be marketed or at the beginning of application development for internaluse software software development costs which include primarily salaries and related payroll costs and costs of independent contractors incurred during development are capitalized research and development costs incurred prior to the establishment of technological feasibility for software to be marketed or prior to application development for internaluse software are expensed as incurred evaluating whether technological feasibility has been achieved requires the use of management judgment 

software development costs are amortized on a productbyproduct basis commencing on the date of general release of the solutions for software to be marketed or the date placed in service for internaluse software software development costs for software to be marketed are amortized using the greater of 1 the straightline method over its estimated useful life which ranges from three to 10 years or 2 the ratio of current revenues to total anticipated revenues over its useful life 

in determining useful lives management considers historical results and technological trends that may influence the estimate useful lives for all computer software range from three to 10 years 

we also assess the recorded value of computer software for impairment on a regular basis by comparing the carrying value to the estimated future cash flows to be generated by the underlying software asset for software to be marketed there are inherent uncertainties in determining the expected useful life or cash flows to be generated from computer software for the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively we have not had more than minimal charges for impairments of software while we have not historically experienced significant changes in these balances due to changes in estimates our results of operations could be subject to such changes in the future 

purchase accounting 

we are required to allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction at their estimated fair values the estimates used to determine the fair value of longlived assets such as intangible assets or computer software are complex and require a significant amount of management judgment we generally engage independent valuation specialists to assist us in making fair value determinations 

if the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the combination occurs we are required to record provisional amounts in the financial statements for the items for which the accounting is incomplete adjustments to provisional amounts initially recorded that are identified during the measurement period are recognized in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined this includes any effect on earnings of changes in depreciation amortization or other income effects as a result of the change to the provisional amounts calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date during the measurement period we are also required to recognize additional assets or liabilities if new information is obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that if known would have resulted in the recognition of those assets and liabilities as of that date the measurement period ends the sooner of one year from the combination date or when we receive the information we were seeking about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date or we learn that more information is not obtainable 

we are also required to estimate the useful lives of intangible assets to determine the amount of acquisitionrelated intangible asset amortization expense to record in future periods we periodically review the estimated useful lives assigned to 

 35 

our finitelived intangible assets to determine whether such estimated useful lives continue to be appropriate additionally we review our indefinitelived intangible assets to determine if there is any change in circumstances that may indicate the asset’s useful life is no longer indefinite 

we had no significant business combinations during the 2018  and 2017  periods 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives should not be amortized but shall be tested for impairment annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate potential impairment fasb asc subtopic 35020 allows an entity first to assess qualitatively whether it is more likely than not that a reporting units carrying amount exceeds its fair value referred to in the guidance as step zero if an entity concludes that it is more likely than not that a reporting units fair value is less than its carrying amount that is a likelihood of more than 50 percent the step one quantitative assessment must be performed for that reporting unit fasb asc subtopic 35020 provides examples of events and circumstances that should be considered in performing the step zero qualitative assessment including macroeconomic conditions industry and market considerations cost factors overall financial performance events affecting a reporting unit or the entity as a whole and a sustained decrease in share price performance of a qualitative impairment assessment requires judgment   

in applying the quantitative analysis we determine the fair value of our reporting units based on a weighted average of multiple valuation techniques principally a combination of an income approach and a market approach the income approach calculates a value based upon the present value of estimated future cash flows while the market approach uses earnings multiples of similarly situated guideline public companies if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the reporting unit’s net assets goodwill is not impaired and further testing is not required 

  we assess goodwill for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter or more frequently if circumstances indicate potential impairment for each of 2018  2017  and 2016 we began our annual impairment test with the step zero qualitative assessment in performing the step zero qualitative assessment for each year examining those factors most likely to affect our valuations we concluded that it remained more likely than not that the fair value of each of our reporting units continued to exceed their carrying amounts consequently we did not perform a step one quantitative assessment specifically for the purpose of our annual impairment test for these years 

similar to the fasb asc subtopic 35020 guidance for goodwill fasb asc subtopic 35030 allows an organization to first perform a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that an indefinitelived intangible asset has been impaired we assess indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter or more frequently if circumstances indicate potential impairment for 2016 we engaged independent specialists to perform a valuation of our indefinitelived intangible assets using a form of income approach valuation known as the relieffromroyalty method there was substantial excess of fair value over carrying value for our indefinitelived intangible assets in the 2016 independent valuations based upon this quantitative assessment performed there was no impairment for 2016 for each of 2018  and 2017  we performed a qualitative assessment examining those factors most likely to affect our valuations and concluded that it remained more likely than not that our indefinitelived intangible assets were not impaired consequently we did not perform a quantitative impairment assessment specifically for the purpose of our annual impairment test for either of these years 

determining the fair value of a reporting unit or acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives involves judgment and the use of significant estimates and assumptions which include assumptions regarding forecasted revenue growth rates operating margins capital expenditures tax rates and other factors used to calculate estimated future cash flows in addition riskadjusted discount rates and future economic and market conditions and other assumptions are applied goodwill was 135 billion  and 137 billion  as of december 31 2018  and 2017  respectively and indefinitelived intangible assets were 43 million  and 48 million  as of december 31 2018  and 2017  respectively as a result a meaningful change in one or more of the underlying forecasts estimates or assumptions used in testing these assets for impairment could result in a material impact on the companys results of operations and financial position however because there was a substantial excess of fair value over carrying value in our previous independent valuations performed in 2015 for goodwill and 2016 for indefinitelived intangible assets we believe the likelihood of obtaining materially different results based on a change of assumptions is low

revenue 

revenue for 2018  decreased 245 million  or 28  from 2017  due to 1 the reduction in revenue from the sale of the capco consulting business and the risk and compliance consulting business during the third quarter of 2017 2 the reduction in revenue from the sale of the pse business during the first quarter of 2017 and 3 the reduction in revenue from the sale of the certegy check services business unit in north america during the third quarter of 2018 this decrease was partially offset by 1 increased volumes in banking and wealth solutions excluding the effects of the sale of the risk and compliance consulting business 2 increased sales for gfs banking and payments solutions 3 growth in corporate and digital solutions 

 38 

4 growth in retail payments and 5 payments growth in latin america additionally 2018  was impacted by a 40 million unfavorable foreign currency impact primarily resulting from a stronger us dollar versus the brazilian real 

  

revenue for 2017  decreased 163 million  or 18  from 2016  due to the reduction in revenue from the sale of the pse business during the first quarter of 2017 and the sale of the capco consulting business and the risk and compliance consulting business during the third quarter of 2017 these decreases were partially offset by 1 increased volumes in banking and wealth solutions excluding the effects of the sale of the risk and compliance consulting business 2 volume growth in payment solutions in brazil 3 continued growth with our existing customers for our posttrade derivative solutions and 4 growth in corporate and digital solutions the 2017 period also benefited from a lower purchase accounting adjustment as compared to the 2016 period to reduce sungard acquired deferred revenue to fair value and a 16 million favorable foreign currency impact primarily resulting from a stronger brazilian real versus the us dollar partially offset by a weaker pound sterling see segment results of operations for more detailed explanation 

cost of revenue and gross profit 

cost of revenues totaled 5569 million   5794 million  and  5895 million  during 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively resulting in gross profit of 2854 million  2874 million  and 2936 million  respectively gross profit as a percentage of revenues gross margin was 339  332  and 332  in 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively the decrease in gross profit for 2018  as compared to 2017  primarily resulted from the revenue variances noted above the gross profit percentage for 2018  as compared to 2017  benefited from higher margin software licenses and the realization of ongoing expense synergies 

 

selling general and administrative expenses 

selling general and administrative expenses for 2018  decreased 141 million  or 98  from 2017  the yearoveryear decrease is primarily driven by the sale of pse during the first quarter of 2017 the sale of the capco consulting business and risk and compliance consulting business during the third quarter of 2017 the sale of certegy check services business unit in north america during the third quarter of 2018 and cost management initiatives 

selling general and administrative expenses for 2017  decreased 265 million  or 155  from 2016  primarily driven by the sale of pse during the first quarter of 2017 the sale of the capco consulting business and risk and compliance consulting business during the third quarter of 2017 and integration and cost management initiatives 

operating income 

operating income totaled 1458 million  1432 million  and 1229 million  for 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively operating income as a percentage of revenue operating margin was 173  165  and 139  for 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively the annual changes in operating income resulted from the revenue and cost variances addressed above the change in operating margin during 2018 was negatively impacted by asset impairments of 95 million related to the unwinding of the brazilian venture notwithstanding the asset impairments however operating margins improved primarily from cost management initiatives and the capco consulting business divestiture during 2017 the increase in operating margin from 2017 as compared to 2016 resulted primarily from integration and cost management initiatives 

total other income expense net 

interest expense is typically the primary component of total other income expense net 

the decrease of 45 million  in interest expense in 2018  as compared to 2017  is primarily due to a lower weightedaverage interest rate on the outstanding debt and benefits realized from interest rate swaps executed in the fourth quarter of 2018 which are discussed in note 11 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

the decrease of 44 million  in interest expense in 2017  as compared to 2016  is primarily due to lower outstanding debt and lower weightedaverage interest rate on the outstanding debt 

other income expense net for 2018  includes a pretax loss of 54 million on the sale of the certegy check services business unit in north america and 12 million to unwind the brazilian venture partially offset by a pretax gain of 19 million on the sale of reliance trust company of delaware 

other income expense net for 2017  includes 1 a pretax charge of 171 million in tender premiums and the writeoff of previously capitalized debt issuance costs on the repurchase of approximately 2000 million in aggregate principal of debt

during 2016 fis paid down the 2017 term loans and partially paid down the 2018 term loans resulting in a pretax charge upon extinguishment of approximately 2 million  due to the writeoff associated with previously capitalized debt issue costs additionally in 2016 as a result of these debt pay downs fis terminated interest rate swaps with a notional amount totaling 1250 million  resulting in a pretax loss of 2 million  due to the release of fair value changes from other comprehensive earnings 

provision benefit for income taxes 

provision benefit for income taxes from continuing operations totaled 208 million  321 million  and 291 million  for 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively this resulted in an effective tax rate on continuing operations of 188  329  and 348  for 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively the effective tax rate for the 2018  period included the impact of the reduction in the us federal income tax rate from 35 to 21 due to tax reform enacted december 22 2017 and a net detriment of 33 million due to the book basis in excess of the tax basis of certain businesses sold during the year the effective tax rate for the 2017  period included a net benefit of 761 million related to tax reform items including 48 million of tax credits due to tax planning strategies implemented in the fourth quarter and a net detriment of 180 million due to the book basis in excess of the tax basis of certain businesses sold during the year the effective tax rate for the 2016 period did not include a net benefit for the recognition of excess tax benefit for stock compensation as the effective date of asu 201609 was for reporting periods beginning after december 15 2016

liquidity and capital resources 

cash requirements 

our ongoing cash requirements include operating expenses income taxes mandatory debt service payments capital expenditures stockholder dividends working capital and timing differences in settlementrelated assets and liabilities and may include discretionary debt repayments share repurchases and business acquisitions our principal sources of funds are cash generated by operations and borrowings including the capacity under our revolving credit facility and the commercial paper program described in note 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

as of december 31 2018  we had cash and cash equivalents of 703 million  and debt of 8985 million  including the current portion net of capitalized debt issuance costs of the 703 million  cash and cash equivalents approximately 340 million  is held by our foreign entities the majority of our domestic cash and cash equivalents represents net depositsintransit at the balance sheet dates and relates to daily settlement activity we expect that cash and cash equivalents plus cash flows from operations over the next 12 months will be sufficient to fund our operating cash requirements capital expenditures and mandatory debt service 

we currently expect to continue to pay quarterly dividends however the amount declaration and payment of future dividends is at the discretion of our board of directors and depends on among other things our investment opportunities results of operations financial condition cash requirements future prospects and other factors that may be considered relevant by our board of directors including legal and contractual restrictions additionally the payment of cash dividends may be limited by covenants in certain debt agreements a regular quarterly dividend of 035 per common share is payable on march 29 2019 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on march 15 2019 

on july 20 2017 our board of directors approved a plan authorizing repurchases of up to 40 billion of our outstanding common stock in the open market at prevailing market prices or in privately negotiated transactions through december 31 2020 this share repurchase authorization replaced any existing share repurchase authorization 

cash flows from operations 

cash flows from operations were 1993 million  1741 million  and 1925 million  in 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively our net cash provided by operating activities consists primarily of net earnings adjusted to add back depreciation and amortization cash flows from operations increased 252 million  in 2018  and decreased 184 million  in 2017  the 2018  increase in cash flows from operations is primarily due to lower trade receivables from increased collections resulting from a reduction in days sales outstanding these increases were partially offset by us federal estimated income tax payments normally due in the third and fourth quarters of 2017 that were paid during the first quarter of 2018 due to the hurricane irma relief program and timing of working capital the 2017  decrease in cash flows from operations is primarily due to increased trade receivables resulting from timing differences in billing and collections and increased deferred contract costs 

capital expenditures and other investing activities 

our principal capital expenditures are for computer software purchased and internally developed and additions to property and equipment we invested approximately 622 million  613 million  and 616 million  in capital expenditures excluding capital leases and other financing obligations during 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively we expect to invest approximately 75 of 2019 revenue in capital expenditures 

in 2017 cash flows from investing activities included proceeds from the sale of businesses and investments primarily relating to the sale of pse and the capco consulting and risk and compliance businesses

recent accounting pronouncements 

        recently adopted accounting guidance 

on march 30 2016 the fasb issued asu no 201609 asu 201609 compensation  stock compensation topic 718 improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting  the amendments were intended to simplify and improve the accounting for employee sharebased payments under the new guidance all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies overunder compensation expense recognized will be reflected in the income statement as they occur this will replace the prior guidance which required tax benefits that exceed compensation expense windfalls to be recognized in equity it also eliminates the need to maintain a windfall pool and removes the requirement to delay recognizing a windfall until it reduces current taxes payable the new guidance also changes the cash flow presentation of excess tax benefits classifying them as operating inflows consistent with other cash flows related to income taxes under prior guidance windfalls were classified as financing activities these changes may result in more volatile net earnings similarly effective tax rates are subject to more variability since the new guidance reflects all tax benefit excesses and deficiencies in tax expense under prior practice stock compensation generally did not impact the effective tax rate since any difference between compensation expense and the ultimate tax deduction was reflected in additional paid in capital also under the new guidance excess tax benefits are no longer to be included in assumed proceeds from applying the treasury stock method when computing diluted earnings per share since they no longer are recognized in additional paid in capital consequently the reduction to common stock equivalents for assumed purchases from proceeds are lower and the impact of common stock equivalents are more dilutive for public companies the amendments are effective for annual periods beginning after december 15 2016 and interim periods within those annual periods thus asu 201609 was effective for fis as of january 1 2017 fis applied prospectively the recording of excess tax benefits as income tax expense and the presentation of those benefits as an operating activity within the statement of cash flows and therefore prior periods have not been adjusted during 2016 we recorded 32 million to consolidated equity as excess tax benefits from our stock plans 

in august 2016 the fasb issued asu no 201615 asu 201615 statement of cash flows topic 230 classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments  the amendments are meant to reduce the diversity in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented in the statement of cash flows asu 201615 provides guidance as to the presentation on the statement of cash flows for eight specific cash flow issues which are 1 debt prepayment for debt 

 44 

extinguishment costs 2 settlement of zerocoupon debt instruments or other debt instruments with coupon interest rates that are insignificant in relation to the effective interest rate of the borrowing 3 contingent consideration payments made after a business combination 4 proceeds for the settlement of insurance claims 5 proceeds from the settlement of corporateowned life insurance policies including bankowned life insurance policies 6 distributions received from equity method investees 7 beneficial interests in securitization transactions and 8 separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle for public companies the amendments are effective for annual periods beginning after december 15 2018 and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after december 15 2019 early adoption is permitted for any organization in any interim or annual period fis elected to adopt this standard in the third quarter of 2017 fis has applied the presentation guidance above to its statements of cash flows and all adjustments have been reflected on a retrospective basis the primary impact of adopting the new guidance is our 2017 presentation of debt prepayment and related costs being reflected in financing activities rather than operating activities 

in august 2017 the fasb issued asu no 201712 asu 201712 derivatives and hedging topic 815  targeted improvements to accounting for hedging activities  the amendments were meant to improve the financial reporting of hedging relationships to better portray the economic results of an entity’s risk management activities in its financial statements the amendments in this update also make certain targeted improvements to simplify the application of the hedge accounting guidance in current gaap asu 201712 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2018 including interim periods within those fiscal years the asu allows for early adoption in any interim period after issuance of the update fis elected to adopt this standard as of january 1 2018 the adoption of this asu did not have an impact on the companys consolidated financial statements 

in march 2017 the fasb issued asu no 201707 asu 201707 compensation  retirement benefits  the asu improves the presentation of net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit cost in the statements of operations under asu 201707 the service cost component of the net periodic benefit cost is disclosed in the same income statement line item as other employee compensation costs arising from services rendered during the period and the other components are reported separately from the line item that includes the service cost and outside of any subtotal of operating income asu 201707 is effective for annual periods beginning after december 15 2017 and early adoption is permitted fis adopted the provisions of asu 201707 as of january 1 2018 as a result there was no material effect on the companys consolidated financial statements 

in november 2016 the fasb issued asu no 201618 asu 201618 statement of cash flows topic 230 restricted cash  asu 201618   requires companies to include restricted amounts with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning and end of period total amounts shown on the statements of cash flows fis adopted the provisions of asu 201618 as of january 1 2018 as a result there was no material effect on the company’s consolidated financial statements 

in january 2016 the fasb issued asu no 201601 asu 201601 recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities  asu 201601 amends guidance on the classification and measurement of financial instruments including significant revisions in accounting related to the classification and measurement of investments in equity securities and presentation of certain fair value changes for financial liabilities when the fair value option is elected the amendment requires equity securities to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized through net earnings and amends certain disclosure requirements associated with the fair value of financial instruments in the period of adoption the company is required to reclassify the unrealized gainslosses on equity securities within accumulated other comprehensive income loss to retained earnings in february 2018 the fasb issued asu no 201803 technical corrections and improvements to financial instruments  overall subtopic 82510    which clarified certain aspects of the previously issued asu fis adopted the provisions of asu 201601 as of january 1 2018 as a result there was no material effect on the company’s consolidated financial statements 

       in may 2014 the fasb issued asu no 201409 topic 606 revenue from contracts with customers topic 606  topic 606 amends substantially all authoritative literature for revenue recognition including industryspecific requirements and converges the guidance under this topic with that of the international financial reporting standards it also includes guidance on accounting for the incremental costs of obtaining and costs incurred to fulfill a contract with a customer topic 606 implements a fivestep process for customer contract revenue recognition that focuses on transfer of control as opposed to transfer of risk and rewards topic 606 also requires enhanced disclosures regarding the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows from contracts with customers the fasb has issued several amendments to topic 606 including further guidance on principal versus agent consideration clarification on identifying performance obligations and accounting for licenses of intellectual property 

 45 

the effective date of topic 606 was postponed to reporting periods beginning after december 15 2017 with early adoption allowed for reporting periods beginning after december 15 2016 we adopted the new standard effective january 1 2018 

entities can transition to the standard with retrospective application to the earliest years presented in their financial statements retrospectively using certain practical expedients or with a cumulativeeffect adjustment as of the date of adoption we adopted the new standard using the retrospective method with the application of certain practical expedient s on may 10 2018 the company filed a current report on form 8k to recast its consolidated financial statements for each of the years in the threeyear period ended december 31 2017 to reflect our retrospective application of asu 201409 

the largest impacts from the adoption of topic 606 on our revenue recognition are related to the following areas 

 

impacts related to other changes introduced by the standard were substantially less significant than those listed above 

upon retrospective application of topic 606 our revenue decreased by approximately 455 million and 410 million and net earnings decreased approximately 58 million and 43 million for the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016 respectively for the year ended december 31 2017 the net earnings decrease included additional tax expense of approximately 21 million due to the remeasurement of deferred tax assets the impact of topic 606 on our 2017 and 2016 operating results may or may not be representative of the impact on subsequent years’ results we have not calculated the impact of topic 606 on our 2018 operating results as compared to not applying topic 606 

    recent accounting guidance not yet adopted      

on february 25 2016 the fasb issued asu no 201602 leases topic 842  which requires lessees to recognize leases onbalance sheet and disclose key information about leasing arrangements topic 842 was subsequently amended by asu no 201801 land easement practical expedient for transition to topic 842  asu no 201810 codification improvements to topic 842 leases  asu no 201811 targeted improvements  and asu no 201820 leases topic 842 narrowscope improvements for lessors  collectively the new standard the new standard establishes a rightofuse model rou that requires a lessee to recognize a rou asset and lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with a term longer than 12 months leases will be classified as finance or operating with classification affecting the pattern and classification of expense recognition in the income statement under the new standard lessor accounting is largely unchanged 

the new standard is effective for public business entities on january 1 2019 with early adoption permitted a modified retrospective transition approach is required applying the new standard to all leases existing at the date of initial application an entity may choose to use either 1 its effective date or 2 the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements as its date of initial application if an entity chooses the second option the transition requirements for existing leases also apply to leases entered into between the date of initial application and the effective date the entity must also recast its comparative period financial statements and provide the disclosures required by the new standard for the comparative periods we will adopt the new standard effective january 1 2019 and use the effective date as our date of initial application consequently financial information will not be updated and the disclosures required under the new standard will not be provided for dates and periods before january 1 2019 

the new standard provides a number of optional practical expedients in transition we expect to elect the package of practical expedients which permits us not to reassess under the new standard our prior conclusions about lease identification lease classification and initial direct costs we do not expect to elect the useofhindsight or the practical expedient pertaining to land easements the new standard also provides practical expedients for an entity’s ongoing accounting we currently expect to elect the practical expedient to not separate lease and nonlease components for all of our leases we do not currently expect to elect the shortterm lease recognition exemption 

 46 

we expect that this standard will have an immaterial effect on results of operations while we continue to assess all of the effects of adoption we currently believe the most significant effects relate to the recognition of new rou assets and lease liabilities on our balance sheet for our real estate operating leases and providing new disclosures about our leasing activities    on adoption we currently expect to recognize additional rou assets and lease liabilities for operating leases ranging from 400 million  to 500 million  

  on june 16 2016 the fasb issued asu no 201613 asu 201613  financial instruments  credit losses topic 326 measurements on credit losses of financial instruments  this asu was subsequently amended by asu no 201819 codification improvements to topic 326 financial instruments  credit losses  collectively topic 326 the primary objectives of topic 326 are to implement new methodology for calculating credit losses on financial instruments eg trade receivables based on expected credit losses and to broaden the types of information companies must use when calculating the estimated losses under current guidance the credit losses are calculated based on multiple credit impairment objectives and recognition is delayed until the loss is probable to occur under the new guidance financial assets measured at amortized cost basis must be shown as the net amount expected to be collected the credit loss allowance is a contravaluation account availableforsale securities should continue to be recognized in a similar manner to current gaap however the allowance should be presented as an allowance instead of a writedown of the basis of the asset for public business entities the amendments are effective for annual periods beginning after december 15 2019 and interim periods within those annual periods early adoption is permitted for any organization in any interim or annual period beginning after december 15 2018 we do not plan to early adopt and expect that the new guidance will not have a material impact on our financial statement presentation financial position or results of operations 

on august 29 2018 the fasb issued asu no 201815 asu 201815 intangibles  goodwill and other  internaluse software subtopic 35040 customer’s accounting for implementation costs incurred in a cloud computing arrangement that is a service contract  this asu clarifies that implementation costs incurred by customers in cloud computing arrangements should be deferred and recognized over the term of the arrangement if those costs would be capitalized by the customer in a software licensing arrangement under the internaluse software guidance the provisions in asu 201815 should be applied either retrospectively or prospectively to all implementation costs incurred after the date of adoption for public business entities asu 201815 is effective for annual periods beginning after december 15 2019 and interim periods within those annual periods early adoption is permitted we are currently assessing the impact the adoption of asu 201815 will have on our financial position and results of operations

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risks 

tableend 

  market risk 

we are exposed to market risks primarily from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates we periodically use certain derivative financial instruments including interest rate swaps and foreign currency forward contracts to manage interest rate and foreign currency risk we do not use derivatives for trading purposes to generate income or to engage in speculative activity 

interest rate risk 

in addition to existing cash balances and cash provided by operating activities we use fixedrate and variablerate debt to finance our operations we are exposed to interest rate risk on these debt obligations and related interest rate swaps 

the senior notes as described in note 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements represent the majority of our fixedrate longterm debt obligations as of december 31 2018  the carrying value excluding unamortized discounts of the senior notes was 8476 million  as of december 31 2018  the fair value of the senior notes was approximately 8336 million  as of december 31 2018  the potential reduction in fair value of the senior notes from a hypothetical 10  percent increase in market interest rates would not be material to the overall fair value of the debt 

our floating rate risk principally relates to borrowings under our commercial paper program and revolving credit facility as defined in note 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and an interest swap on our fixedrate longterm debt at december 31 2018  our weightedaverage cost of debt was 33  with a weightedaverage maturity of 75  years 89  of our debt was fixedrate and the remaining 11  of our debt was floating rate a 100 basis point increase in the weightedaverage interest rate on our floating rate debt would have increased our 2018  interest expense by 10 million  we performed the foregoing sensitivity analysis based solely on the principal amount of our floating rate debt as of december 31 2018  this 

 47 

sensitivity analysis does not take into account any changes that occurred in the prior 12 months or that may take place in the next 12 months in the amount of our outstanding debt further this sensitivity analysis assumes the change in interest rates is applicable for an entire year for comparison purposes based on principal amounts of floating rate debt outstanding as of december 31 2017  and calculated in the same manner as set forth above an increase of 100 basis points in the weightedaverage interest rate would have increased our annual interest expense by approximately 2 million  

as of december 31 2018  we entered into the following interest rate swap transaction converting the interest rate exposure on our senior euro notes due july 2024 from fixed to variable in millions 



1 0507 in effect as of december 31 2018  

we designated the interest rate swap as a fair value hedge for accounting purposes as described in note 11 of the notes to consolidated financial statements a 100 basis point increase in the 3month euribor rate would increase our annual interest expense by approximately 6 million  

foreign currency risk 

we are exposed to foreign currency risks that arise from normal business operations these risks include the translation of local currency balances of foreign subsidiaries transaction gains and losses associated with intercompany loans with foreign subsidiaries and transactions denominated in currencies other than a locations functional currency we manage the exposure to these risks through a combination of normal operating activities and the use of foreign currency forward contracts and nonderivative and derivative investment hedges contracts are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries 

our exposure to foreign currency exchange risks generally arises from our nonus operations to the extent they are conducted in local currency changes in foreign currency exchange rates affect translations of revenue denominated in currencies other than the us dollar during the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  we generated approximately 1542 million  1821 million  and 1908 million  respectively in revenue denominated in currencies other than the us dollar the major currencies to which our revenues are exposed are the brazilian real the euro the british pound sterling and the indian rupee a 10 move in average exchange rates for these currencies assuming a simultaneous and immediate 10 change in all of such rates for the relevant period would have resulted in the following increase or decrease in our reported revenue for the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  in millions 



while our results of operations have been impacted by the effects of currency fluctuations our international operations revenue and expenses are generally denominated in local currency which reduces our economic exposure to foreign exchange risk in those jurisdictions 

  

revenue included 40 million  of unfavorable and 16 million  of favorable foreign currency impact during 2018  and 2017  respectively resulting from changes in the us dollar net earnings attributable to fis common stockholders included 12 million  of unfavorable and 2 million  of favorable foreign currency impact during 2018  and 2017  respectively resulting from changes in the us dollar for the full year of 2019 we anticipate an approximate 45 million adverse impact to revenue due to foreign currency translation although the actual amount of impact is uncertain due to the many factors that affect exchange rates 

 48 

our foreign exchange risk management policy permits the use of derivative instruments such as forward contracts and options to reduce volatility in our results of operations andor cash flows resulting from foreign exchange rate fluctuations we do not enter into foreign currency derivative instruments for trading purposes or to engage in speculative activity we do periodically enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency exposure to intercompany loans and other balance sheet items we did not have any significant forward contracts as of december 31 2018  or 2017 the company also utilizes organic foreign currency denominated debt and crosscurrency interest rate swaps designated as net investment hedges in order to reduce the volatility of the net investment value of certain of its euro and pound sterling functional subsidiaries see note 11 of the notes to consolidated financial statements

sales and marketing 

we have experienced sales personnel with expertise in particular services and markets as well as in the needs of particular types of customers we believe that focusing our expertise in specific markets eg global financial institutions north american financial institutions and tailoring integrated solution sets of particular value to participants in those markets enables us to leverage opportunities to crosssell and upsell we continue to realign our sales teams to better match our solution expertise with the market opportunity and customer demand we target the majority of our potential customers via direct andor indirect field sales as well as inbound and outbound lead generation and telesales efforts 

our global marketing strategy is to develop and lead the execution of the ifs and gfs strategic marketing plans in support of their revenue and profitability goals and the fis brand key components include thought leadership integrated programs with consistent message development internal and external communications client conference content management web content creation and management trade shows demand generation campaigns and collateral development and management 

patents copyrights trademarks and other intellectual property 

the company owns intellectual property including trademarks trade names copyrights and patents which we believe is important to our future success although we acquired the trademarks and trade names used by sungard we note that following the splitoff of the availability services “as” business by sungard in 2014 as has the right to use the sungard availability services name which does not include the right to use the sungard name or its derivatives 

we rely on a combination of contractual restrictions internal security practices patents copyrights and applicable law to establish and protect our software technology and expertise worldwide we rely on trademark law to protect our rights in our brands we intend to continue taking appropriate measures to protect our intellectual property rights including by legal action when necessary and appropriate in general we own the proprietary rights necessary for the conduct of our business although we do license certain items from third parties under armslength agreements for varying terms including some open source licenses 

competition 

the markets for our solutions and services are intensely competitive depending on the business line in both our ifs and gfs segments our primary competitors include internal technology departments within financial institutions retailers data processing or software development departments of large companies or large computer manufacturers companies that deliver software and integrated services to the financial services industry thirdparty payment processors securities exchanges asset managers card associations clearing networks or associations trust companies independent computer services firms companies that develop and deploy software applications companies owned by global banks selling new competitive solutions companies that provide customized development implementation and support services disruptive technology innovators and business process outsourcing companies many of these companies compete with us across multiple solutions markets and geographies some of these competitors possess greater financial sales and marketing resources than we do competitive factors impacting the success of our services across our segments include the quality of the technologybased application or service application features and functions ease of delivery and integration the ability to maintain enhance and support the applications or services price and overall relationship management we believe we compete favorably in each of these categories in addition we believe our financial services industry expertise combined with our ability to offer multiple applications services and integrated solutions to individual clients enhances our competitiveness against companies with more limited offerings 

research and development 

 7 

our research and development activities have related primarily to the design and development of processing systems and related software applications and risk management platforms we expect to continue our practice of investing an appropriate level of resources to maintain enhance and extend the functionality of our proprietary systems and existing software applications to develop new and innovative software applications and systems to address emerging technology trends in response to the needs of our clients and to enhance the capabilities of our outsourcing infrastructure in addition we intend to offer services compatible with new and emerging delivery channels 

as part of our research and development process we evaluate current and emerging technology for compatibility with our existing and future software platforms to this end we engage with various hardware and software vendors in evaluation of various infrastructure components where appropriate we use thirdparty technology components in the development of our software applications and service offerings in the case of nearly all of our thirdparty software enterprise license agreements exist for the thirdparty component and either alternative suppliers exist or transfer rights exist to ensure the continuity of supply as a result we are not materially dependent upon any thirdparty technology components thirdparty software may be used for highly specialized business functions which we may not be able to develop internally within time and budget constraints additionally thirdparty software may be used for commoditytype functions within a technology platform environment we work with our clients to determine the appropriate timing and approach to introducing technology or infrastructure changes to our applications and services during the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  approximately 2 to 5 of revenues were noncapitalizable research and development expense 

government regulation 

our services are subject to a broad range of complex federal state and foreign regulation and requirements as well as requirements under the rules of selfregulatory organizations including federal truthinlending and truthinsavings rules regulation aa unfair or deceptive acts or practices data protection and privacy laws usury laws laws governing state trust charters the equal credit opportunity act the electronic funds transfer act the fair credit reporting act the fair debt collection practices act the bank secrecy act the usa patriot act the internal revenue code the employee retirement income security act the health insurance portability and accountability act the community reinvestment act and the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the doddfrank act the securities exchange act of 1934 the 1934 act the investment advisors act of 1940 the 1940 act the us foreign corrupt practices act and uk bribery act and the rules and regulations of the financial industry regulatory authority “finra” the securities and exchange commission “sec” and the financial conduct authority in the uk “fca” the compliance of our services and applications with these and other applicable laws and regulations depends on a variety of factors including the manner in which our clients use them in some cases we are directly subject to regulatory oversight and examination in other cases our clients are contractually responsible for determining what is required of them under applicable laws and regulations so that we can assist them in their compliance efforts in either case the failure of our services to comply with applicable laws and regulations may result in restrictions on our ability to provide those services andor the imposition of civil fines andor criminal penalties the principal areas of regulation impacting our business are 

 

our usbased wealth and retirement business holds charters in the states of georgia and delaware which makes us subject to the regulatory compliance requirements of the georgia department of banking and finance and the state of 

 8 

delaware office of the state bank commissioner as a result we are also authorized to provide trust services in various additional states subject to additional applicable state regulations 

 

our subsidiaries also include an secregistered investment adviser and secregistered transfer agent our registered investment adviser is subject to the fiduciary and other obligations imposed on investment advisors under the 1940 act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder as well as various state securities laws our registered transfer agent is subject to the 1934 act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder these laws and regulations generally grant the sec and other supervisory bodies broad administrative powers to address noncompliance with regulatory requirements sanctions that may be imposed for noncompliance with these requirements include the suspension of individual employees limitations on engaging in certain activities for specified periods of time or for specified types of clients the revocation of registrations other censures and significant fines 

subsidiaries engaged in activities outside the us are regulated by various government agencies in the particular jurisdiction where they are chartered incorporated andor conduct their business activity for example pursuant to the uk financial services and markets act 2000 fsma certain of our subsidiaries are subject to regulations promulgated and administered by the fca the fsma and rules promulgated thereunder govern all aspects of the uk investment business including sales research and trading practices provision of investment advice use and safekeeping of client funds and securities regulatory capital record keeping margin practices and procedures approval standards for individuals antimoney laundering periodic reporting and settlement procedures 

 

our financial institution clients operating in the united states are required to comply with privacy regulations imposed under the grammleachbliley act referred to as “glba” glba places restrictions on the use of nonpublic personal information all financial institutions must disclose detailed privacy policies to their customers and offer them the opportunity to direct the financial institution not to share information with third parties the regulations under glba however permit financial institutions to share information with nonaffiliated parties who perform services for the financial institutions as a provider of services to financial institutions we are required to comply with the privacy laws and are bound by the same limitations on disclosure of the information received from our clients as apply to the financial institutions themselves a determination that there have been violations of privacy laws could expose us to significant damage awards fines and other penalties that could individually or in the aggregate materially harm our business and reputation 

in october 2015 the european court of justice ruled that the useu safe harbor framework clauses a compliance method by which we relied in portions of our business to transfer personal data regarding citizens of the eu to the us could no longer be relied upon the us and eu authorities have agreed in principle on a replacement for safe harbor known as “privacy shield” the privacy shield approach has not been fully endorsed by all relevant parties 

 9 

and there have already been challenges to this initiative in the european justice system while we have certified certain lines of business under the privacy shield we have chosen to adopt eu model clauses published by the european commission as the primary basis for the export of data from the eu to the us 

the eu has recently adopted a comprehensive overhaul of its data protection regime from the current national legislative approach to a single european economic area privacy regulation the general data protection regulation “gdpr” which comes into effect on may 26 2018 the proposed eu data protection regime imposes a strict data compliance regime and extends the scope of the eu data protection law to all foreign companies processing data of eu residents although the gdpr will apply across the eu without a need for local implementing legislation as has been the case under the current data protection regime local data protection authorities “dpas” will still have the ability to interpret the gdpr which has the potential to create inconsistencies on a countrybycountry basis the company has adopted a comprehensive global privacy program to assess and manage these evolving risks including contract terms to comply with this new law 

 

we are also subject to certain economic and trade sanctions programs that are administered by the us treasury’s office of foreign assets control referred to as “ofac” which prohibit or restrict transactions to or from or dealings with specified countries their governments and in certain circumstances their nationals and with individuals and entities that are speciallydesignated nationals of those countries narcotics traffickers and terrorists or terrorist organizations similar antimoney laundering laws apply to movements of currency and payments through electronic transactions and to dealings with persons specified in lists maintained by the country equivalents to ofac in several other countries we have implemented policies procedures and internal controls that are designed to comply with the regulations and economic sanctions programs administered by ofac outside the us applicable laws rules and regulations similarly require designated types of financial institutions to implement antimoney laundering programs we have implemented policies procedures and internal controls that are designed to comply with all applicable antimoney laundering laws and regulations 

 

our consumer reporting and facing businesses are subject to cfpb bulletin 20137 an update to the former regulation a unfair deceptive acts or practices which states the definition of unfair deceptive or abusive acts or practices udaap this specific bulletin states that udaaps can cause significant financial injury to consumers erode consumer confidence and undermine fair competition in the financial marketplace original creditors and other covered persons and service providers under the doddfrank act involved in collecting debt related to any consumer financial product or service are subject to the prohibition against udaaps in the doddfrank act 



 10 

trade commission as well as state attorneys general and other agencies have enforcement responsibility over the collection laws as well as the various credit reporting laws 

 

the foregoing list of laws and regulations to which our company is subject is not exhaustive and the regulatory framework governing our operations changes continuously enactment of new laws and regulations may increasingly affect the operations of our business directly and indirectly which could result in substantial regulatory compliance costs litigation expense adverse publicity andor loss of revenue 

information security 

globally attacks on information technology systems continue to grow in frequency complexity and sophistication such attacks have become a point of focus for individuals businesses and governmental entities the objectives of these attacks include among other things gaining unauthorized access to systems to facilitate financial fraud disrupt operations cause denial of service events corrupt data and steal nonpublic sensitive information as part of our business we electronically receive process store and transmit a wide range of confidential information including sensitive customer information and personal consumer data we also operate payment cash access and prepaid card systems 

fis remains focused on making strategic investments in information security to protect our clients and our information systems this includes both capital expenditures and operating expenses on hardware software personnel and consulting services we also participate in industry and governmental initiatives to improve information security for our clients

risk factors 

tableend 

in addition to the normal risks of business we are subject to significant risks and uncertainties including those listed below and others described elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k any of the risks described herein could result in a significant adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

risks related to our business and operations 

 11 

security breaches or attacks or our failure to comply with information security laws or regulations or industry security requirements could harm our business by disrupting our delivery of services and damaging our reputation and could result in a breach of one or more client contracts 

we electronically receive process store and transmit sensitive business information of our clients in addition we collect personal consumer data such as names and addresses social security numbers drivers license numbers cardholder data and payment history records such information is necessary to support our clients’ transaction processing and to conduct our check authorization and collection businesses the uninterrupted operation of our information systems as well as the confidentiality of the customerconsumer information that resides on such systems is critical to our successful operation for that reason cybersecurity is one of the principal operational risks we face as a provider of services to financial institutions if we fail to maintain an adequate security infrastructure adapt to emerging security threats or implement sufficient security standards and technology to protect against security breaches the confidentiality of the information we secure could be compromised unauthorized access to our computer systems or databases could result in the theft or publication of confidential information the deletion or modification of records damages from legal actions from clients andor their customers otherwise cause interruptions in our operations and damage to our reputation these risks are greater with increased information transmission over the internet and the increasing level of sophistication posed by cyber criminals 

as a provider of services to financial institutions and a provider of card processing services we are bound by the same limitations on disclosure of the information we receive from our clients as apply to the clients themselves if we fail to comply with these regulations and industry security requirements we could be exposed to damages from legal actions from clients andor their customers governmental proceedings governmental notice requirements and the imposition of fines or prohibitions on card processing services in addition if more restrictive privacy laws rules or industry security requirements are adopted in the future on the federal or state level or by a specific industry body they could have an adverse impact on us through increased costs or restrictions on business processes any inability to prevent security or privacy breaches or the perception that such breaches may occur could cause our existing clients to lose confidence in our systems and terminate their agreements with us inhibit our ability to attract new clients result in increasing regulation or bring about other adverse consequences from the government agencies that regulate our business 

entity mergers or consolidations and business failures in the banking and financial services industry could adversely affect our business by eliminating some of our existing and potential clients and making us more dependent on a more limited number of clients 

there has been and continues to be substantial consolidation activity in the banking and financial services industry in addition many financial institutions that experienced negative operating results including some of our clients have failed these consolidations and failures reduce our number of potential clients and may reduce our number of existing clients which could adversely affect our revenues even if the events do not reduce the aggregate activities of the consolidated entities further if our clients fail andor merge with or are acquired by other entities that are not our clients or that use fewer of our services they may discontinue or reduce use of our services it is also possible that larger financial institutions resulting from consolidations would have greater leverage in negotiating terms or could decide to perform inhouse some or all of the services we currently provide or could provide any of these developments could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

if we fail to innovate or adapt our services to changes in technology or in the marketplace or if our ongoing efforts to upgrade our technology are not successful we could lose clients or our clients could lose customers and have difficulty attracting new clients for our services 

the markets for our services are characterized by constant technological changes frequent introductions of new services and evolving industry standards our future success will be significantly affected by our ability to enhance our current solutions and develop and introduce new solutions and services that address the increasingly sophisticated needs of our clients and their customers in addition as more of our revenue and market demand shifts to saas cloud bpaas and new disruptive technologies the need to keep pace with rapid technology changes becomes more acute these initiatives carry the risks associated with any new solution development effort including cost overruns delays in delivery and performance issues there can be no assurance that we will be successful in developing marketing and selling new solutions that meet these changing demands that we will not experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development introduction and marketing of these solutions or that our new solutions and their enhancements will adequately meet the demands of the marketplace and achieve market acceptance any of these developments could have an adverse impact on our future revenues andor business prospects 

 12 

we operate in a competitive business environment and if we are unable to compete effectively our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 

the market for our services is intensely competitive our competitors vary in size and in the scope and breadth of the solutions and services they offer some of our competitors have substantial resources we face direct competition from third parties and since many of our larger potential clients have historically developed their key applications inhouse and therefore view their system requirements from a makeversusbuy perspective we also often compete against our potential clients’ inhouse capacities in addition the markets in which we compete have recently attracted increasing competition from smaller startups with disruptive technologies which are receiving increasing investments global banks and businesses controlled by a combination of global banks and global internet companies that are introducing competitive products and services into the marketplace particularly in the payments area emerging technologies and increased competition may also have the effect of unbundling bank solutions and result in picking off solutions we are currently providing from our legacy systems international competitors are also now targeting and entering the us market with greater force there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors or that the competitive pressures we face in the markets in which we operate will not materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations see item i business competition  

global economic political and other conditions including business cycles and consumer confidence may adversely affect our clients or trends in consumer spending which may adversely impact the demand for our services and our revenue and profitability 

a significant portion of our revenue is derived from transaction processing fees the global transaction processing industries depend heavily upon the overall level of consumer business and government spending any change in economic factors including a sustained deterioration in general economic conditions or consumer confidence particularly in the united states or increases in interest rates in key countries in which we operate may adversely affect consumer spending including related consumer debt further reduce check writing and change credit and debit card usage and as a result adversely affect our financial performance by reducing the number or average purchase amount of transactions that we service 

when there is a slowdown or downturn in the economy a drop in stock market levels or trading volumes or an event that disrupts the financial markets our business and financial results particularly with respect to our capital markets businesses may suffer for a number of reasons customers may react to worsening conditions by reducing their capital expenditures in general or by specifically reducing their information technology spending in addition customers may curtail or discontinue trading operations delay or cancel information technology projects or seek to lower their costs by renegotiating vendor contracts moreover competitors may respond to market conditions by lowering prices and attempting to lure away our customers to lower cost solutions any more protective trade policies or actions taken by the us may also result in other countries reducing or making more expensive services permitted to be provided by us based companies if any of these circumstances remain in effect for an extended period of time there could be a material adverse effect on our financial results 

constraints within global financial markets or international regulatory requirements could constrain our financial institution clients ability to purchase our services impacting our future growth and profitability 

a significant number of our clients and potential clients may hold sovereign debt of economically struggling nations or be subject to emerging international requirements such as basel iii which could require changes in their capitalization and hence the amount of their working capital available to purchase our services these potential constraints could alter the ability of clients or potential clients to purchase our services and thus could have a significant impact on our future growth and profitability 

the sales and implementation cycles for many of our software and service offerings can be lengthy and require significant investment from both our clients and fis if we fail to close sales or if a client chooses not to complete an installation after expending significant time and resources to do so our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 

the sales and associated deployment of many of our software or service offerings often involve significant capital commitments by our clients andor fis potential clients generally commit significant resources to an evaluation of available software and services and require us to expend substantial time effort and money educating them prior to sales further as part of the sale or deployment of our software and services clients may also require fis to perform significant related services to complete a proof of concept or custom development to meet their needs all of the aforementioned activities may expend significant funds and management resources and ultimately the client may determine not to close the sale or complete the implementation if we are unsuccessful in closing sales or if the client decides not to complete an implementation after we 

 13 

expend significant funds and management resources or we experience delays it could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our results may fluctuate from period to period because of the lengthy and unpredictable sales cycle for our software changes in our mix of licenses and services activity by competitors and customer budgeting operational requirements or renewal cycles 

particularly with respect to gfs our operating results may fluctuate from period to period and be difficult to predict in a particular period due to the timing and magnitude of software license sales and other factors we offer a number of our software solutions on a license basis which means that the customer has the right to run the software on its own computers the customer usually makes a significant upfront payment to license software which we generally recognize as revenue when the license contract is signed and the software is delivered the size of the upfront payment often depends on a number of factors that are different for each customer such as the number of customer locations users or accounts the sales cycle for a software license may be lengthy and take unexpected turns further our customers’ business models are shifting away from paying upfront license fees to paying periodic rental fees for services thus it is difficult to predict when software sales will occur or how much revenue they will generate since there are few incremental costs associated with software sales our operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year due to the timing and magnitude of software sales our results may also vary as a result of pricing pressures increased cost of equipment the evolving and unpredictable markets in which our solutions and services are sold changes in accounting principles and competitors’ new solutions or services 

in addition there are a number of other factors that could cause our sales and results of operation to fluctuate from period to period including 

  

 

failure to obtain new clients or renew client contracts on favorable terms could adversely affect results of operations and financial condition 

we may face pricing pressure in obtaining and retaining our clients larger clients may be able to seek price reductions from us when they renew a contract when a contract is extended or when the clients business has significant volume changes they may also reduce services if they decide to move services inhouse further our smaller and midsize clients may also exert pricing pressure particularly on renewal due to pricing competition or other economic needs or pressures being experienced by the client on some occasions this pricing pressure results in lower revenue from a client than we had anticipated based on our previous agreement with that client this reduction in revenue could result in an adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

further failure to renew client contracts on favorable terms could have an adverse effect on our business our contracts with clients generally run for several years and include liquidated damage provisions that provide for early termination fees terms are generally renegotiated prior to the end of a contracts term if we are not successful in achieving a high rate of contract renewals on favorable terms our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

our business and operating results could be adversely affected if we experience business interruptions errors or failure in connection with our or thirdparty information technology and communication systems and other software and hardware used in connection with our business if we experience defects or design errors in the software solutions we offer or more generally if the thirdparty vendors we rely upon are unwilling or unable to provide the services we need to effectively operate our business 

many of our services including our transformation services are based on sophisticated software and computing systems and we may encounter delays when developing new technology solutions and services further the technology solutions underlying our services have occasionally contained and may in the future contain undetected errors or defects when first introduced or when new versions are released in addition we may experience difficulties in installing or integrating our

technologies on platforms used by our clients or our clients may cancel a project after we have expended significant effort and resources to complete an installation finally our systems and operations could be exposed to damage or interruption from fire natural disaster power loss telecommunications failure unauthorized entry and computer viruses defects in our technology solutions errors or delays in the processing of electronic transactions or other difficulties could result in i interruption of business operations ii delay in market acceptance iii additional development and remediation costs iv diversion of technical and other resources v loss of clients vi negative publicity or vii exposure to liability claims any one or more of the foregoing could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations although we attempt to limit our potential liability through controls including system redundancies security controls application development and testing controls and disclaimers and limitationofliability provisions in our license and client agreements we cannot be certain that these measures will always be successful in preventing disruption or limiting our liability 

further most of the solutions we offer are very complex software systems that are regularly updated no matter how careful the design and development complex software often contains errors and defects when first introduced and when major new updates or enhancements are released if errors or defects are discovered in current or future solutions we may not be able to correct them in a timely manner if at all in our development of updates and enhancements to our software solutions we may make a major design error that makes the solution operate incorrectly or less efficiently the failure of software to properly perform could result in the company and its clients being subjected to losses or liability including censures fines or other sanctions by the applicable regulatory authorities and we could be liable to parties who are financially harmed by those errors in addition such errors could cause the company to lose revenues lose clients or damage its reputation 

in addition we generally depend on a number of third parties both in the united states and internationally to supply elements of our systems computers research and market data connectivity communication network infrastructure other equipment and related support and maintenance we cannot be certain that any of these third parties will be able to continue providing these services to effectively meet our evolving needs if our vendors or in certain cases vendors of our customers fail to meet their obligations provide poor or untimely service or we are unable to make alternative arrangements for the provision of these services we may in turn fail to provide our services or to meet our obligations to our customers and our business financial condition and operating results could be materially harmed 

  

the doddfrank act may result in business changes for our clients that have or could have an adverse effect on our financial condition revenues results of operations or prospects for future growth and overall business  

our clients are required to comply with numerous regulations the doddfrank act and associated durbin amendment were passed and signed into law in 2010 the doddfrank act represents a comprehensive overhaul of the regulations governing the financial services industry within the united states the doddfrank act established the cfpb and requires this and other federal agencies to implement many new regulations which have the potential to increase the amount and types of regulation on areas of our business that were not previously regulated 

several regulations and rules have or will be written and implemented as directed by the doddfrank act these rules and regulations have or will require our clients or potential clients to comply with requirements and could require us to directly comply with regulations these requirements have or could result in the need for fis to make capital investments to modify our solutions and services to facilitate our clients and potential clients compliance as well as to deploy additional processes or reporting to comply with regulations further requirements of the regulations have or could result in changes in our clients business practices and those of other marketplace participants that may alter the delivery of services to consumers which have or could impact the demand for our software and services as well as alter the type or volume of transactions that we process on behalf of our clients as a result these requirements have or could have an adverse impact on our financial condition revenues results of operations prospects for future growth and overall business 

many of our clients are subject to a regulatory environment and to industry standards that may change in a manner that reduces the types or volume of solutions or services we provide or may reduce the type or number of transactions in which our clients engage and therefore reduces our revenues 

our clients are subject to a number of government regulations and industry standards with which our services must comply our clients must ensure that our services and related solutions work within the extensive and evolving regulatory and industry requirements applicable to them federal state foreign or industry authorities could adopt laws rules or regulations affecting our clients businesses that could lead to increased operating costs and could reduce the convenience and functionality of our services possibly resulting in reduced market acceptance in addition action by regulatory authorities relating to credit availability data usage privacy or other related regulatory developments could have an adverse effect on our clients and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition revenues results of operations prospects for future 

 15 

growth and overall business elimination of regulatory requirements could also adversely affect the sales of our solutions designed to help clients comply with complex regulatory environments 

regulations enacted by the cfpb or state regulatory authorities such as the new york state department of financial services may require fis to adopt new business practices which may require capital investment andor incremental expenses which could impact our future operating results 

the cfpb regulates financial and nonfinancial institutions and providers to those institutions the cfpb continues to establish rules for regulating nonfinancial institution providers to ensure adequate protection of consumer privacy and to ensure consumers are not impacted by deceptive business practices the new york department of financial services has enacted new rules that require covered financial institutions to establish and maintain cyber security programs the impact of these rules and any future rules may require fis to be subject to additional regulation and adopt additional business practices that could require additional capital expenditures or impact our operating results changes to state money transmission laws and regulations including changing interpretations and the implementation of new or varying regulatory requirements may result in the need for additional money transmitter licenses these changes could result in increased costs of compliance as well as fines or penalties 

our revenues from the sale of services to members of visa mastercard american express discover and other similar organizations are dependent upon our continued certification and sponsorship and the loss or suspension of certification or sponsorship could adversely affect our business 

in order to provide our card processing services we must be certified including applicable sponsorship by visa mastercard american express discover and other similar organizations these certifications are dependent upon our continued adherence to the standards of the issuing bodies and sponsoring member banks the member financial institutions some of which are our competitors set the standards with which we must comply if we fail to comply with these standards we could be fined our certifications could be suspended or our registration could be terminated the suspension or termination of our certifications or any changes in the rules and regulations governing visa mastercard american express discover or other similar organizations could result in a reduction in revenue or increased costs of operation which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business 

changes in card association and debit network fees or products could increase costs or otherwise limit our operations 

from time to time card associations and debit networks increase the interchange fees that they charge it is possible that competitive pressures will result in our absorption of a portion of such increases in the future which would increase our operating costs reduce our profit margin and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations furthermore the rules and regulations of the various card associations and networks prescribe certain capital requirements any increase in the capital level required would further limit our use of capital for other purposes 

interchange fees and related practices have been receiving significant legal and regulatory scrutiny worldwide the resulting regulatory changes that could occur from proposed regulations could alter the fees charged by card associations and debit networks worldwide such changes could have an adverse impact on our business or financial condition due to reductions or changes in types of transactions processed on behalf of our clients 

our securities brokerage operations are highly regulated and subject to risks that are not encountered in our other businesses 

one of our subsidiaries is an sec registered brokerdealer in the us and others are authorized by the fca to conduct certain regulated business in the uk domestic and foreign regulatory and selfregulatory organizations such as the sec finra and the fca can among other things fine censure issue ceaseanddesist orders against and suspend or expel a brokerdealer or its officers or employees for failure to comply with the many laws and regulations that govern brokerage activities those laws and regulations derive from a variety of policy considerations and address a wide range of topics including those designed to protect customers of brokerdealers and the privacy of their information and those designed to protect the integrity of the markets such as laws and regulations requiring brokerdealers to report suspicious activity of customers sanctions for failure to comply with such laws and regulations may arise out of currentlyconducted activities or those conducted in prior periods our ability to comply with these laws and regulations is largely dependent on our establishment maintenance and enforcement of an effective brokerage compliance program failure to establish maintain and enforce the required brokerage compliance procedures even if unintentional could subject us to significant losses lead to disciplinary or other actions and tarnish our reputation regulations affecting the brokerage industry may change which could adversely affect our financial results 

 16 

we are exposed to certain risks relating to the execution services provided by our brokerage operations to our customers and counterparties which include other brokerdealers active traders hedge funds asset managers and other institutional and noninstitutional clients these risks include but are not limited to customers or counterparties failing to pay for or deliver securities trading errors the inability or failure to settle trades and trade execution system failures as trading in the us securities markets has become more automated the potential impact of a trading error or a rapid series of errors caused by a computer or human error or a malicious act has become greater in our other businesses we generally can disclaim liability for trading losses that may be caused by our software but in our brokerage operations we may not be able to limit our liability for trading losses or failed trades even when we are not at fault as a result we may suffer losses that are disproportionately large compared to the relatively modest profit contributions of our brokerage operations 

privacy laws and regulations such as the gdpr require fis to adopt new business practices and contractual provisions in existing and new contracts which may require transitional and incremental expenses which may impact our future operating results 

new privacy laws such as the gdpr continue to develop in ways we cannot predict privacy laws may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to country and impose inconsistent or conflicting requirements complying with varying jurisdictional requirements could increase the costs and complexity of compliance or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business and violations of privacy laws can result in significant penalties and damage to our brand and business 

implementation of the gdpr will require changes to certain of our business practices thereby increasing our costs failure to comply with the requirements of the gdpr could result in significant penalties and loss of business among other things 

if we fail to comply with applicable regulations or to meet regulatory expectations our business results of operations or financial condition could be adversely impacted 

the majority of our data processing services for financial institutions are not directly subject to federal or state regulations specifically applicable to financial institutions such as banks thrifts and credit unions however as a provider of services to these financial institutions our data processing operations are examined on a regular basis by various federal and state regulatory authorities and by international regulatory authorities such as the fca in certain jurisdictions if we fail to comply with any applicable regulations or guidelines for operations of a data services provider we could be subject to regulatory actions or rating changes may not meet contractual obligations and may suffer harm to our client relationships or reputation failure to meet the aforementioned requirements or to adapt to new requirements at the federal state or international level could inhibit our ability to retain existing clients or obtain new clients which could have an adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition 

in addition to our data processing services described above we also have business operations that store process or transmit consumer information or have direct relationships with consumers that are obligated to comply with regulations including but not limited to the federal fair credit reporting act the federal fair debt collection practices act and applicable privacy requirements further our international businesses must comply with applicable laws such as the us foreign corrupt practices act failure to maintain compliance with or adapt to changes in any of the aforementioned requirements could result in fines penalties or regulatory actions that could have an adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition 

high profile payment card industry or digital banking security breaches could impact consumer payment behavior patterns in the future and reduce our card payment transaction volumes 

  we are unable to predict whether or when high profile card payment or digital banking security breaches will occur and if they occur whether consumers will transact less on their payment cards or reduce their digital banking service if consumers transact less on cards issued by our clients or reduce digital banking services and we are not able to adapt to offer our clients alternative technologies it could have a significant adverse impact on our revenue and related earnings 

misappropriation of our intellectual property and proprietary rights or a finding that our patents are invalid could impair our competitive position 

our ability to compete depends in some part upon our proprietary solutions and technology despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our services or to obtain and use information that we 

 17 

regard as proprietary or challenge the validity of our patents with governmental authorities policing unauthorized use of our proprietary rights is difficult we cannot make any assurances that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of technology or that the agreements entered into for that purpose will be enforceable effective patent trademark service mark copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our applications and services are made available online misappropriation of our intellectual property or potential litigation concerning such matters could have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 

if our applications or services are found to infringe the proprietary rights of others we may be required to change our business practices and may also become subject to significant costs and monetary penalties 

as our information technology applications and services develop we are increasingly subject to infringement claims any claims whether with or without merit could i be expensive and timeconsuming to defend ii result in an injunction or other equitable relief which could cause us to cease making licensing or using applications that incorporate the challenged intellectual property iii require us to redesign our applications if feasible iv divert management’s attention and resources and v require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements in order to obtain the right to use necessary technologies or pay damages resulting from any infringing use 

some of our solutions contain “open source” software and any failure to comply with the terms of one or more of these open source licenses could negatively affect our business 

we use a limited amount of software licensed by its authors or other third parties under socalled “open source” licenses and may continue to use such software in the future some of these licenses contain requirements that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the open source software and that we license such modifications or derivative works under the terms of a particular open source license or other license granting third parties certain rights of further use by the terms of certain open source licenses we could be required to release the source code of our proprietary software if we combine our proprietary software with open source software in a certain manner additionally the terms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by united states or other courts and there is a risk that these licenses could be construed in a manner that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our solutions in addition to risks related to license requirements usage of open source software can lead to greater risks than use of thirdparty commercial software as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on origin of the software we have established processes to help alleviate these risks including a review process for screening requests from our development organizations for the use of open source but we cannot be sure that all open source is submitted for approval prior to use in our solutions in addition many of the risks associated with usage of open source cannot be eliminated and could if not properly addressed negatively affect our business 

we face liability to our merchant clients if checks that we have guaranteed are dishonored by the check writer’s bank 

if checks that we have guaranteed are dishonored by the check writers banks we must reimburse our merchant clients for the checks face value and pursue collection from the check writers in some cases we recognize a liability to our merchant clients for estimated check returns and a receivable for amounts we estimate we will recover from the check writers based on historical experience and other relevant factors the estimated check returns and recovery amounts are subject to the risk that actual amounts returned may exceed our estimates and actual amounts recovered by us may be less than our estimates changes in economic conditions the risk characteristics and composition of our clients and other factors could impact our actual and projected amounts 

lack of system integrity fraudulent payments credit quality and undetected errors related to funds settlement or the availability of clearing services could result in a financial loss 

we settle funds on behalf of financial institutions other businesses and consumers and receive funds from clients card issuers payment networks and consumers on a daily basis for a variety of transaction types transactions facilitated by us include debit card credit card electronic bill payment transactions banking payments and check clearing that supports consumers financial institutions and other businesses these payment activities rely upon the technology infrastructure that facilitates the verification of activity with counterparties the facilitation of the payment as well as the detection or prevention of fraudulent payments if our continuity of operations integrity of processing or ability to detect or prevent fraudulent payments were compromised this could result in a financial loss to us in addition we rely on various financial institutions to provide ach services in support of funds settlement for certain of our solutions if we are unable to obtain such ach services in the future that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations in addition we may issue credit to consumers financial institutions or other businesses as part of the funds settlement a default on this credit by a counterparty could result in a financial loss to us furthermore if one of our clients for which we facilitate 

 18 

settlement suffers a fraudulent event due to an error of their controls we may suffer a financial loss if the client does not have sufficient capital to cover the loss 

failure to properly manage or mitigate risks in the operation of our wealth and retirement businesses in the us and the uk could have adverse liability consequences 

 we have wealth and retirement businesses in the us and uk engaged in processing securities transactions on behalf of clients and serving as a custodian failure to properly manage or mitigate risks in those operations and increased volatility in the financial markets may increase the potential for and magnitude of resulting losses including those that may arise from human errors or omissions defects or interruptions in computer or communications systems or breakdowns in processes or in internal controls human errors or omissions may include failures to comply with applicable laws or corporate policies and procedures theft fraud or misappropriation of assets whether arising from the intentional actions of internal personnel or external third parties     in addition the usbased business holds charters in the states of georgia and delaware which exposes us to further regulatory compliance requirements of the georgia department of banking and finance and the office of the commissioner of banking in the state of delaware the us wealth and retirement business is required to hold certain levels of regulatory capital as defined by the state banking regulators in the states in which they hold a bank or trust charter delaware and georgia in the uk our platform securities and broker dealer businesses are regulated by the fca and are subject to further regulatory capital requirements we also have registered investment advisor and transfer agent businesses regulated by the sec and subject to further regulatory requirements 

our business is subject to the risks of international operations including movements in foreign currency exchange rates 

the international operations of fis represented approximately 26 of our total 2017 revenues and are largely conducted in currencies other than the us dollar including the british pound brazilian real euro and indian rupee our business and financial results could be adversely affected due to a variety of factors including 

 • unexpected or unfavorable changes in foreign laws regulatory requirements and related interpretations 

• difficulty of effective enforcement of contractual provisions in local jurisdictions 

• inadequate intellectual property protection in foreign countries 

 control regulations particularly in emerging markets 

in foreign countries particularly in those with developing economies certain business practices may exist that are prohibited by laws and regulations applicable to us such as the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and other anticorruption laws although our policies and procedures require compliance with these laws and are designed to facilitate compliance with these laws our employees contractors and agents may take actions in violation of applicable laws or our policies any such violation even if prohibited by our policies could have a material adverse effect on our business and 

reputation 

as we expand our international operations more of our clients may pay us in foreign currencies conducting business in currencies other than us dollars subjects us to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that can negatively impact our results period to period including relative to analyst estimates or guidance our primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to foreign currencies in brazil europe including the united kingdom australia and parts of asia the us dollar value of our net investments in foreign operations the periodic conversion of foreigndenominated earnings to the us dollar our reporting currency and our results of operations and in some cases cash flows could be adversely affected in a material manner by movements in foreign currency exchange rates these risks could cause an adverse effect on the business financial position and results of operations of the company 

 19 

the referendum on the united kingdom’s membership in the european union could cause disruption to and create uncertainty surrounding our business 

the referendum on the united kingdom’s the uk membership in the european union the eu referred to as “brexit” approving the exit of the united kingdom from the european union could cause disruptions to and create uncertainty surrounding our business including affecting our relationships with our existing and future clients suppliers and employees which could have an adverse effect on our business financial results and operations the uk government has commenced negotiations to determine the future terms of the uk’s relationship with the eu including the terms of trade between the uk and the eu and other nations the effects of brexit will depend on any agreements the uk makes to retain access to eu markets either during a transitional period or more permanently in addition because the terms of trade between the uk and jurisdictions other than the eu may be currently governed by trade agreements between the eu and such other jurisdictions the uk may be required to negotiate new terms of trade with such other jurisdictions these potential measures could disrupt the markets we serve and the tax jurisdictions in which we operate and adversely change tax benefits or liabilities in these or other jurisdictions and may cause us to lose clients suppliers and employees in addition brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the uk determines which eu laws to replace or replicate 

actions to implement brexit may also create global economic uncertainty which may cause our clients to closely monitor their costs and reduce their spending on our solutions and services 

any of these effects of brexit among others could materially adversely affect our business business opportunities results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we have businesses in emerging markets that may experience significant economic volatility 

 we have operations in emerging markets primarily in brazil india southeast asia the middle east and africa these emerging market economies tend to be more volatile than the more established markets we serve in north america and europe which could add volatility to our future revenues and earnings 

failure to attract and retain skilled technical employees or senior management personnel could harm our ability to grow 

our future success depends upon our ability to attract and retain highlyskilled technical personnel because the development of our solutions and services requires knowledge of computer hardware operating system software system management software and application software our technical personnel must be proficient in a number of disciplines competition for such technical personnel is intense and our failure to hire and retain talented personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

our future growth will also require sales and marketing financial and administrative personnel to develop and support new solutions and services to enhance and support current solutions and services and to expand operational and financial systems there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain the necessary personnel to accomplish our growth strategies and we may experience constraints that could adversely affect our ability to satisfy client demand in a timely fashion 

our ability to maintain compliance with applicable laws rules and regulations and to manage and monitor the risks facing our business relies upon the ability to maintain skilled compliance security risk and audit professionals competition for such skillsets is intense and our failure to hire and retain talented personnel could have an adverse effect on our internal control environment and impact our operating results 

our senior management team has significant experience in the financial services industry and the loss of this leadership could have an adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition further the loss of this leadership may have an adverse impact on senior managements ability to provide effective oversight and strategic direction for all key functions within the company which could impact our future business operating results and financial condition 

we are the subject of various legal proceedings that could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability 

we are involved in various litigation matters including in some cases classaction and patent infringement litigation if we are unsuccessful in our defense of litigation matters we may be forced to pay damages andor change our business practices any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

 20 

 unfavorable resolution of tax contingencies or unfavorable future tax law changes could adversely affect our tax expense 

our tax returns and positions are subject to review and audit by federal state local and international taxing authorities an unfavorable outcome to a tax audit could result in higher tax expense and could negatively impact our effective tax rate financial position results of operations and cash flows in the current andor future periods the us recently enacted significant tax reform and certain provisions of the new law could have an adverse impact to us unfavorable future tax law changes could also result in negative impacts in addition taxlaw amendments in the united states and other jurisdictions could significantly impact how united states multinational corporations are taxed although we cannot predict whether or in what form such legislation will pass if enacted it could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 

a material weakness in our internal controls could have a material adverse effect on us 

effectiv e  internal controls are necessary for us to provide reasonable assurance with respect to our financial reports and to adequately mitigate risk of fraud if we cannot provide reasonable assurance with respect to our financial reports and adequately mitigate risk of fraud our reputation and operating results could be harmed internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations including the possibility of human error the circumvention or overriding of controls or fraud therefore even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements in addition projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

  

a material weakness is a deficiency or combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting could adversely impact our ability to provide timely and accurate financial information if we are unable to report financial information timely and accurately or to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures we could be subject to among other things regulatory or enforcement actions by the sec any one of which could adversely affect our business prospects 

risks related to business combinations and ventures 

we continue to incur substantial expenses related to the sungard acquisition which was completed on november 30 2015 and the integration of sungard 

we continue to incur substantial expenses in connection with the integration of sungard we continue to integrate a large number of processes policies procedures operations technologies and systems including information technology data centers purchasing accounting and finance sales billing information security risk legal marketing and human resources including payroll and employee benefits while we have attempted to estimate the aftertax integration and restructuring costs and other costs incurred to execute the transaction following completion of the sungard acquisition many of the expenses that will be incurred are by their nature difficult to estimate accurately although we expect that the realization of efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses will offset incremental transaction mergerrelated and restructuring costs over time we cannot give any assurance that this net benefit will be achieved in the near term or at all 

there could be significant liability for us if all or part of the as splitoff were determined to be taxable for us federal or state income tax purposes 

on march 31 2014 sungard completed the splitoff of its availability services as business to its existing stockholders including its private equity owners on a taxfree and prorata basis the “as splitoff” at the time sungard received opinions from outside tax counsel to the effect that the as splitoff should qualify for taxfree treatment as transactions described in section 355 and related provisions of the internal revenue code as amended the “code” in addition actions taken following the as splitoff including the sungard acquisition and certain 50 percent or greater changes by vote or value of the stock ownership of the new entity conducting the as business may cause the as splitoff to be taxable to fis in connection with the sungard acquisition we and sungard received opinions of outside tax counsel to the effect that the sungard acquisition should not cause the as splitoff to fail to so qualify 

notwithstanding the receipt of tax opinions the taxfree treatment of the as splitoff is not free from doubt and there is a risk that the internal revenue service the “irs” a state taxing authority or a court could conclude to the contrary that the separation of the as business from sungard may not qualify as taxfree transactions an opinion of tax counsel is not binding on the irs state taxing authorities or any court and as a result there can be no assurance that a tax authority will not challenge the 

 21 

taxfree treatment of all or part of the as splitoff or that if litigated a court would not agree with the irs or a state taxing authority further these tax opinions rely on certain facts assumptions representations warranties and covenants from sungard the new entity conducting the as business and from some of sungard’s stockholders regarding the past and future conduct of the companies’ respective businesses share ownership and other matters if any of the facts assumptions representations warranties and covenants on which the opinions rely is inaccurate or incomplete or not satisfied the opinions may no longer be valid moreover the irs or state taxing authority could determine on audit that the as splitoff is taxable if it determines that any of these facts assumptions representations warranties or covenants are not correct or have been violated or if it disagrees with one or more conclusions in the opinions or for other reasons 

if the as splitoff is determined to be taxable we and possibly our stockholders could incur significant income tax liabilities these tax liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

actions taken by sungard availability services capital inc or its stockholders could cause the as splitoff to fail to qualify as a taxfree transaction and sungard availability services capital inc may be unable to fully indemnify sungard for the resulting significant tax liabilities 

pursuant to the tax sharing and disaffiliation agreement “tax sharing agreement” that sungard entered into with sungard availability services capital inc “spinco” spinco is required to indemnify sungard for certain taxes relating to the as splitoff that result from i any breach of the representations or the covenants made by spinco regarding the preservation of the intended taxfree treatment of the as splitoff ii any action or omission that is inconsistent with the representations statements warranties and covenants provided to tax counsel in connection with their delivery of tax opinions to sungard with respect to the as splitoff and iii any other action or omission that was likely to give rise to such taxes when taken in each case by spinco or any of its subsidiaries conversely if any such taxes are the result of such a breach or certain other actions or omissions by sungard sungard would be wholly responsible for such taxes in addition if any part of the as splitoff fails to qualify for the intended taxfree treatment for reasons other than those for which sungard or spinco would be wholly responsible pursuant to the provisions described above spinco will be obligated to indemnify sungard for 23 of the liability for taxes imposed in respect of the as splitoff and sungard would bear the remainder of such taxes if spinco is required to indemnify sungard for any of the foregoing reasons spinco’s indemnification liabilities could potentially exceed its net asset value and spinco may be unable to fully reimburse or indemnify sungard for its significant tax liabilities arising from the as splitoff as provided by the tax sharing agreement 

we have a substantial investment in our brazilian venture and obtain significant revenue through that venture that would be lost and result in significant termination costs if our venture partner were to terminate the agreement to the extent not replaced by further commercial agreements 

brazilian venture revenue attributable to our brazilian venture partner banco bradesco was 317 million  in 2017 the contract that we have with our brazilian venture partner allows for the termination or partial termination of the contract which ends september 30 2020 at any point during the 10year term if minimum targets are met minimum targets under the brazilian venture agreement have been met and the parties have begun negotiations to determine their future business relationship during these negotiations the brazilian venture agreement remains in effect depending on the results of these negotiations our future revenue and earnings growth in brazil could be adversely impacted for further detail on our brazilian venture see note 17 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

additionally the brazilian venture employs approximately 11000 employees in brazil who would have the ability to file labor claims if their employment is terminated if our brazilian venture partner were to terminate the agreement we and they may be subject to labor claims filed by employees of the brazilian venture these claims if realized could result in a significant cost and impact to our earnings 

we have substantial investments in recorded goodwill and other intangible assets as a result of prior acquisitions and a severe or extended economic downturn could cause these investments to become impaired requiring writedowns that would reduce our operating income 

as of december 31 2017 goodwill aggregated to 137 billion  or 560  of total assets and other indefinitelived intangible assets aggregated to 48 million  or 02  of total assets current accounting rules require goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets to be assessed for impairment at least annually or whenever changes in circumstances indicate potential impairment factors that may be considered a change in circumstance include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results a significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization and negative industry or economic trends the results of our 2017 annual assessment of the recoverability of goodwill indicated that the fair values of the company’s reporting units were in excess of the carrying values of those reporting units and thus no goodwill 

 22 

impairment existed as of december 31 2017 likewise the fair value of indefinitelived intangible assets was also in excess of the carrying value of those assets as of december 31 2017 however if worldwide or united states economic conditions decline significantly with negative impacts to bank spending and consumer behavior  or if other business or market changes impact our outlook  the carrying amount of our goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets may no longer be recoverable and we may be required to record an impairment charge which would have a negative impact on our results of operations 

as of december 31 2017 intangible assets with finite useful lives aggregated to 3902 million  or 159  of total assets current accounting rules require intangible assets with finite useful lives to be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable factors that may be considered a change in circumstance include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results a significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization and negative industry or economic trends 

we will continue to monitor the fair value of our intangible assets as well as our market capitalization and the impact of any economic downturn on our business to determine if there is an impairment in future periods 

risks related to our indebtedness 

our existing debt levels and future levels under existing facilities and debt service requirements may adversely affect our financial condition or operational flexibility and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our outstanding indebtedness 

as of december 31 2017 we had total debt of approximately 88 billion  this level of debt or any increase in our debt level could have adverse consequences for our business financial condition operating results and operational flexibility including the following i the debt level may cause us to have difficulty borrowing money in the future for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions or other purposes ii our debt level may limit operational flexibility and our ability to pursue business opportunities and implement certain business strategies iii some of our debt has a variable rate of interest which exposes us to the risk of increased interest rates iv we have a higher level of debt than some of our competitors or potential competitors which may cause a competitive disadvantage and may reduce flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions including increased competition and vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  v there are significant maturities on our debt that we may not be able to repay at maturity or that may be refinanced at higher rates and vi  if we fail to satisfy our obligations under our outstanding debt or fail to comply with the financial or other restrictive covenants contained in the indenture governing our senior notes or our credit facility an event of default could result that could cause all of our debt to become due and payable

the following section discusses management’s view of the financial condition and results of operations of fis and its consolidated subsidiaries as of december 31 2017  and 2016  and for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  

this section should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes of fis included elsewhere in this annual report management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forwardlooking statements see “forwardlooking statements” and “risk factors” for a discussion of the uncertainties risks and assumptions associated with these forwardlooking statements that could cause future results to differ materially from those reflected in this section 

overview 

fis is a global leader in financial services technology with a focus on retail and institutional banking payments asset management and wealth and retirement risk and compliance and outsourcing solutions through the depth and breadth of our solutions portfolio global capabilities and domain expertise fis serves more than 20000 clients in over 130 countries headquartered in jacksonville florida fis employs more than 53000 people worldwide and holds leadership positions in payment processing financial software and banking solutions providing software services and outsourcing of the technology that empowers the financial world fis is a fortune 500 company and is a member of the standard  poor’s 500 ®  index 

we have grown organically as well as through acquisitions which have contributed critical applications and services that complement or enhance our existing offerings diversifying our revenues by customer geography and service offering the completion of the sungard acquisition on november 30 2015 increased our existing portfolio to include solutions that automate a wide range of complex business processes for financial services institutions and corporate and government treasury departments 

  

       in 2015 fis finalized a reorganization and began reporting its financial performance based on three segments integrated financial solutions “ifs” global financial solutions “gfs” and corporate and other we recast all previous periods to 

conform to the new segment presentation following our november 30 2015 acquisition of sungard the sungard business was included within the gfs segment as its economic characteristics international business model and various 

other factors largely aligned with those of our gfs segment as we further integrated the acquired sungard businesses through march 31 2016 we reclassified certain sungard businesses corporate liquidity and wealth and retirement that are 

oriented more to the retail banking and payments activities of ifs into that segment certain other businesses from both sungard public sector and education businesses which were divested in february 2017 and legacy fis global commercial services and retail check processing were reclassified to the corporate and other segment as were sungard administrative expenses prior periods were reclassified to conform to the current segment presentation a description of these segments is included in note 19 of the notes to consolidated financial statements revenues by segment and the results of operations of our segments are discussed below in segment results of operations 

  

business trends and conditions 

our revenue is primarily derived from a combination of recurring technology and processing services professional services and software license fees the majority of our revenue has historically been recurring and has been provided under multiyear contracts that contribute relative stability to our revenue stream these services in general are considered critical to our clients operations a considerable portion of these recurring revenues is derived from transaction processing fees that fluctuate with the level of accounts and card transactions among other variable measures associated with consumer commercial and capital markets activity professional services revenues are typically nonrecurring and sales of software licenses are less predictable a portion of which can be regarded as discretionary spending by our clients 

       the sungard acquisition broadened our solution portfolio enabling us to expand beyond our traditional banking and payments markets into the institutional and wholesale side of financial institutions as well as other capital markets organizations it also significantly expanded our existing solutions and client base in wealth and retirement treasury and corporate payments these solutions are in demand among our regional and community financial institution clients as they look for ways to replace highly regulated fee revenues the combination also favorably impacted our revenue mix with a greater concentration of license revenues and higher margin services through the integration of sungard into our existing operations we achieved significant cost savings around administration and technology expenses and exited 2017 with a cost synergy runrate savings exceeding 325 million 

  

 31 

we are actively migrating many financial institutions to outsourced integrated technology solutions to improve their profitability and address increasing and ongoing regulatory requirements as a provider of outsourcing solutions we benefit from multiyear recurring revenue streams which help moderate the effects of broader yeartoyear economic and market changes that otherwise might have a larger impact on our results of operations we believe our integrated solutions and outsourced services are well positioned to address this outsourcing trend across the markets we serve 

  

consumer preference continues to shift from traditional branch banking services to digital banking solutions and our clients seek to provide a single integrated banking experience through their branch mobile internet and voice banking channels we are focused on enabling our clients to deliver this experience to their customers through our integrated solutions and services we continue to innovate and invest in these integrated solutions and services to assist clients as they address this market demand this is an area of ongoing competition from global banks international providers and disruptive technology innovators 

  

we continue to see demand for innovative solutions in the payments market that will deliver faster more convenient payment solutions in mobile channels internet applications and cards we believe digital payments will grow and partially replace existing payment tender volumes over time as consumers and merchants embrace the convenience incremental services and benefits digital payment volume is growing significantly but does not yet represent a meaningful amount of the payments market additionally new formidable nontraditional payments competitors and large merchants are investing in and innovating digital payment technologies to address the emerging market opportunity and it is unclear the extent to which particular technologies or services will succeed we believe the growth of digital payments continues to present both an opportunity and a risk to us as the market develops although we cannot predict which digital payment technologies or solutions will be successful we cautiously believe our client relationships payments infrastructure and experience adapted solutions and emerging solutions are well positioned to maintain or grow our clients existing payment volumes which is our focus 

high profile north american merchant payment card information security breaches have pushed the payment card industry towards emv integrated circuit cards as financial institutions card networks and merchants seek to improve information security and reduce fraud costs we invested in our card management solutions and card manufacturing and processing capabilities to accommodate emv integrated circuit cards so we can continue to guide our clients through this technology transition and grow our card driven businesses a large portion of the migration to emv is complete the remaining migration will continue as financial institutions issue replacement cards 

we anticipate consolidation within the banking industry will continue primarily in the form of merger and acquisition activity which we believe as a whole is detrimental to our business however consolidation resulting from specific merger and acquisition transactions may be beneficial to our business when consolidations of financial institutions occur merger partners often operate systems obtained from competing service providers the newly formed entity generally makes a determination to migrate its core and payments systems to a single platform when a financial institution processing client is involved in a consolidation we may benefit by their expanding the use of our services if such services are chosen to survive the consolidation and support the newly combined entity conversely we may lose revenue if we are providing services to both entities or if a client of ours is involved in a consolidation and our services are not chosen to survive the consolidation and support the newly combined entity it is also possible that larger financial institutions resulting from consolidation may have greater leverage in negotiating terms or could decide to perform inhouse some or all of the services that we currently provide or could provide we seek to mitigate the risks of consolidations by offering other competitive services to take advantage of specific opportunities at the surviving company 

notwithstanding challenging global economic conditions our ongoing international business continued to experience growth on a constant currency basis demand for our solutions may also continue to be driven in developing countries by governmentled financial inclusion policies aiming to reduce the unbanked population and by growth in the middle classes in these markets driving the need for more sophisticated banking solutions the majority of our european revenue is generated by clients in the united kingdom france and germany in 2017 we have experienced minimal foreign currency impacts 

  

brazilian venture revenue attributable to our brazilian venture partner banco bradesco was 317 million  in 2017 the contract that we have with our brazilian venture partner allows for the termination or partial termination of the contract which ends september 30 2020 at any point during the 10year term if minimum targets are met minimum targets under the brazilian venture agreement have been met and the parties have begun negotiations to determine their future business relationship during these negotiations the brazilian venture agreement remains in effect depending on the results of these negotiations our future revenue and earnings growth in brazil could be adversely impacted for further detail on our brazilian venture see note 17 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

 32 

globally attacks on information technology systems continue to grow in frequency complexity and sophistication this is a trend we expect to continue such attacks have become a point of focus for individuals businesses and governmental entities the objectives of these attacks include among other things gaining unauthorized access to systems to facilitate financial fraud disrupt operations cause denial of service events corrupt data and steal nonpublic information these circumstances present both a threat and an opportunity for fis as part of our business we electronically receive process store and transmit a wide range of confidential information including sensitive customer information and personal consumer data we also operate payment cash access and prepaid card systems 

fis remains focused on making strategic investments in information security to protect our clients and our information systems this includes both capital expenditures and operating expense on hardware software personnel and consulting services we also participate in industry and governmental initiatives to improve information security for our clients through the expertise we have gained with this ongoing focus and involvement we have developed fraud security risk management and compliance solutions to target this growth opportunity in the financial services industry 

as described in note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements on july 31 2017 we sold a majority interest in certain of our consulting businesses to affiliates of cdr these businesses had lower margins than many of our other businesses the consulting businesses sold were included within the gfs and ifs segments also on feburary 1 2017 we sold our pse business which had been included in our corporate and other segment 

critical accounting policies 

the accounting policies described below are those we consider critical in preparing our consolidated financial statements these policies require management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures with respect to contingent liabilities and assets at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods actual amounts could differ from those estimates see note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a more detailed description of the significant accounting policies that have been followed in preparing our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

the company generates revenues from the delivery of bank processing credit and debit card processing services other payment processing services professional services software licensing software as a service saas business process as a service bpaas cloud revenue and software related services revenues are recognized when evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred fees are fixed or determinable and collection is considered probable each of these primary revenue recognition criteria requires exercising an appropriate level of judgment we are frequently a party to multiple concurrent contracts with the same client these situations require judgment to determine whether the individual contracts should be aggregated or evaluated separately for purposes of revenue recognition in making this determination we consider the timing of negotiating and executing the contracts whether the different elements of the contracts are interdependent and whether any of the payment terms of the contracts are interrelated our individual contracts also frequently include multiple elements we must apply judgment in these circumstances in determining whether individual elements can be considered separate units of accounting or should instead be accounted for in combination with other deliverables judgment is also required in ascribing fair value to each deliverable for purposes of allocating consideration 

for certain agreements we use contract accounting if the arrangement with the customer includes significant customization modification or production of software for these arrangements we use the percentageofcompletion method which requires the use of reasonable estimates of total revenues and contract hours these estimates are revised and updated at each reporting period additionally a small percentage of revenues including some equipment sales and merchant interchange fees are recognized on a netofcost basis because the company is not the primary obligor among other criteria the determination of gross versus net recognition requires judgment in evaluating the companys contractual obligations to the customer 

due to the large number broad nature and average size of individual contracts we are party to the impact of judgments and assumptions that we apply in recognizing revenue for any single contract is not likely to have a material effect on our consolidated operations or financial position however the broader accounting policy assumptions that we apply across similar arrangements or classes of clients could significantly influence the timing and amount of revenue recognized in our historical and future results of operations or financial position additional information about our revenue recognition policies is included in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements 

computer software 

 33 

computer software includes the fair value of software acquired in business combinations purchased software and capitalized software development costs purchased software is recorded at cost and amortized using the straightline method over its estimated useful life which is generally three to five years software acquired in business combinations is recorded at its fair value and amortized using straightline or accelerated methods over its estimated useful life which is three to ten years as discussed below in the critical accounting policy section purchase accounting as of december 31 2017 and december 31 2016 computer software net of accumulated amortization was 17 billion  and 16 billion  respectively and amortization of computer software was 436 million  396 million  and 229 million  for the years ended december 31 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively balances related to acquired software represent a significant portion of these balances particularly for the periods after the acquisition of sungard which resulted in acquired software of 674 million  

the capitalization of software development costs is governed by fasb asc subtopic 98520 if the software is to be sold leased or otherwise marketed or by fasb asc subtopic 35040 if the software is for internal use after the technological feasibility of the software has been established for software to be marketed or at the beginning of application development for internaluse software software development costs which include primarily salaries and related payroll costs and costs of independent contractors incurred during development are capitalized research and development costs incurred prior to the establishment of technological feasibility for software to be marketed or prior to application development for internaluse software are expensed as incurred evaluating whether technological feasibility has been achieved requires the use of management judgment 

software development costs are amortized on a productbyproduct basis commencing on the date of general release of the solutions for software to be marketed or the date placed in service for internaluse software software development costs for software to be marketed are amortized using the greater of 1 the straightline method over its estimated useful life which ranges from three to 10 years or 2 the ratio of current revenues to total anticipated revenues over its useful life 

in determining useful lives management considers historical results and technological trends that may influence the estimate useful lives for all computer software range from three to 10 years 

we also assess the recorded value of computer software for impairment on a regular basis by comparing the carrying value to the estimated future cash flows to be generated by the underlying software asset for software to be marketed there are inherent uncertainties in determining the expected useful life or cash flows to be generated from computer software for the years ended december 31 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively we have not had more than minimal charges for impairments of software while we have not historically experienced significant changes in these balances due to changes in estimates our results of operations could be subject to such changes in the future 

purchase accounting 

we are required to allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction at their estimated fair values the estimates used to determine the fair value of longlived assets such as intangible assets or computer software are complex and require a significant amount of management judgment we generally engage independent valuation specialists to assist us in making fair value determinations 

if the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the combination occurs we are required to record provisional amounts in the financial statements for the items for which the accounting is incomplete adjustments to provisional amounts initially recorded that are identified during the measurement period are recognized in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined this includes any effect on earnings of changes in depreciation amortization or other income effects as a result of the change to the provisional amounts calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date during the measurement period we are also required to recognize additional assets or liabilities if new information is obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that if known would have resulted in the recognition of those assets and liabilities as of that date the measurement period ends the sooner of one year from the combination date or when we receive the information we were seeking about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date or we learn that more information is not obtainable 

we are also required to estimate the useful lives of intangible assets to determine the amount of acquisitionrelated intangible asset amortization expense to record in future periods we periodically review the estimated useful lives assigned to our finitelived intangible assets to determine whether such estimated useful lives continue to be appropriate additionally we review our indefinitelived intangible assets to determine if there is any change in circumstances that may indicate the asset’s useful life is no longer indefinite 

 34 

we had no significant business combinations during the 2016 and 2017 periods 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives should not be amortized but shall be tested for impairment annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate potential impairment fasb asc topic 350 allows an entity first to assess qualitatively whether it is more likely than not that a reporting units carrying amount exceeds its fair value referred to in the guidance as step zero if an entity concludes that it is more likely than not that a reporting units fair value is less than its carrying amount that is a likelihood of more than 50 percent the step one quantitative assessment must be performed for that reporting unit asc topic 350 provides examples of events and circumstances that should be considered in performing the step zero qualitative assessment including macroeconomic conditions industry and market considerations cost factors overall financial performance events affecting a reporting unit or the entity as a whole and a sustained decrease in share price   

in applying the quantitative analysis we determine the fair value of our reporting units based on a weighted average of multiple valuation techniques principally a combination of an income approach and a market approach the income approach calculates a value based upon the present value of estimated future cash flows while the market approach uses earnings multiples of similarly situated guideline public companies if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the reporting unit’s net assets goodwill is not impaired and further testing is not required 

  we assess goodwill for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter using a september 30 measurement date unless circumstances require a more frequent measurement for each of 2017 and 2016 we began our annual impairment test with the step zero qualitative analysis in performing the step zero qualitative analysis for each year examining those factors most likely to affect our valuations we concluded that it remained more likely than not that the fair value of each of our reporting units continued to exceed their carrying amounts consequently we did not perform a step one quantitative analysis specifically for the purpose of our annual impairment test in any year presented in these financial statements 

we also estimate the fair value of acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives and compare this amount to the underlying carrying value annually similar to the asc topic 350 guidance for goodwill asc section 3601035 allows an organization to first perform a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that an indefinitelived intangible asset has been impaired 

we engaged independent specialists to perform a valuation of our indefinitelived intangible assets in 2016 and 2015 using a form of income approach valuation known as the relieffromroyalty method for 2017 we began our assessment of indefinite lived intangibles with the step zero qualitative analysis because there was a substantial excess of fair value over carrying value for each of our indefinitelived intangible assets based on the 2016 and 2015 independent valuations based upon the results of these assessments there were no indications of impairment 

determining the fair value of a reporting unit or acquired intangible assets with indefinitelives involves judgment and the use of significant estimates and assumptions which include assumptions regarding forecasted revenue growth rates operating margins capital expenditures tax rates and other factors used to calculate estimated future cash flows in addition riskadjusted discount rates and future economic and market conditions and other assumptions are applied goodwill was 137 billion  and 142 billion  as of december 31 2017 and 2016 respectively and indefinitelived intangibles was 48 million  and 80 million  as of december 31 2017 and 2016 respectively as a result a meaningful change in one or more of the underlying forecasts estimates or assumptions used in testing these assets for impairment could result in a material impact on the companys results of operations and financial position however because there was a substantial excess of fair value over carrying value in each of our previous independent valuations we believe the likelihood of obtaining materially different results based on a change of assumptions is low 

accounting for income taxes 

as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements we are required to determine income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate this process involves estimating actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing recognition of items for income tax and financial reporting purposes these differences result in deferred income tax assets and liabilities which are included within the consolidated balance sheets management uses bests estimates and assumptions available during this process 

 35 

we must then assess the likelihood that deferred income tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely establish a valuation allowance to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase or decrease this allowance in a period we must reflect this increase or decrease as an expense or benefit within income tax expense in the consolidated statements of earnings we consider history of losses forecasted earnings statutory usage limitations of the deferred tax asset and possible tax planning strategies in determining whether or not we believe a valuation allowance is necessary 

determination of the income tax expense requires estimates and can involve complex issues that may require an extended period to resolve further changes in the geographic mix of revenues or in the estimated level of annual pretax income can cause the overall effective income tax rate to vary from period to period we also receive periodic assessments from taxing authorities challenging our positions that must be taken into consideration in determining our tax reserves resolving these assessments which may or may not result in additional taxes due may also require an extended period of time we believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and we adequately account for any known tax contingencies we reserve for uncertain tax positions using a twostep process first we determine if the tax position meets the more likely than not recognition threshold based on all available evidence and second we estimate the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement we believe the estimates and assumptions used to support our evaluation of tax benefit realization are reasonable however final determination of prioryear tax liabilities either by settlement with tax authorities or expiration of statutes of limitations could be materially different than estimates reflected in assets and liabilities and historical income tax provisions the outcome of these final determinations could have a material effect on our income tax provision net income or cash flows in the period that a determination is made 

related party transactions 

we are a party to certain historical related party agreements as discussed in note 17 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of part ii of this annual report 

factors affecting comparability 

our consolidated financial statements included in this report which presents our financial position and results of operations reflect the following significant transactions 

 

 

fis 40  ownership in cardinal was initially valued at 172 million  and was recorded as an equity method investment included within other noncurrent assets on the consolidated balance sheet after the sale on july 31 2017 fis began to recognize the earnings in aftertax equity method investment earnings outside of operating income and segment adjusted ebitda for periods prior to july 31 2017 the capco consulting business and risk and compliance consulting business were included within operating income and segment adjusted ebitda 

 36 

 

 

 

as a result of the above transactions our financial position results of operations earnings per share and cash flows in the periods covered by the consolidated financial statements may not be directly comparable 

 37 

consolidated results of operations 

in millions except per share amounts 



 amounts may not sum due to rounding 

processing and services revenues 

processing and services revenues for 2017 decreased 118 million  or 13  due to the reduction in revenue from the sale of the pse business during the first quarter of 2017 and the sale of the capco consulting business and the risk and compliance consulting business during the third quarter of 2017 these decreases were partially offset by 1 increased demand in banking and wealth solutions excluding the effects of the risk and compliance consulting business sale 2 volume growth in payment solutions in brazil 3 continued growth with our existing customers for our posttrade derivative solutions and 4 growth in corporate and digital solutions the 2017 period also benefited from a lower purchase accounting adjustment as compared to the 2016 period to reduce sungard acquired deferred revenue to fair value and a 16 million favorable foreign currency 

 38 

impact primarily resulting from a stronger brazilian real versus the us dollar partially offset by a weaker pound sterling see segment results of operations for more detailed explanation 

  

processing and services revenues for 2016 increased 2645 million  or 401  due to incremental revenues from the sungard acquisition as well as growth in our consulting business increased demand for output solutions increased card processing volumes in brazil card production activities associated with the rollout of emv cards across the industry volume growth in debit payments and demand for regulatory and compliance solutions the processing and services revenue increase was partially offset by 192 million  of purchase accounting impact on deferred revenue all of which was recorded as a contrarevenue item and 100 million of unfavorable foreign currency impact primarily resulting from a stronger us dollar versus the pound sterling and brazilian real 

cost of revenues and gross profit 

cost of revenues totaled 6181 million  6233 million  and 4395 million  during 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively resulting in gross profit of 2942 million  3008 million  and 2201 million  respectively gross profit as a percentage of revenues “gross margin” was 322  326  and 334  in 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively the decrease in gross profit for 2017  as compared to 2016   primarily resulted from the revenue variances noted above the gross profit percentage for 2017  as compared to 2016  was negatively impacted by higher acquired intangible asset amortization expense resulting from the sungard acquisition partially offset by higher margin software licenses and the realization of ongoing expense synergies the gross profit for 2016  as compared to 2015  was negatively impacted by higher acquired intangible asset amortization expense and higher incentive compensation during 2016 this negative impact was partially offset by the addition of higher margin revenues from sungard as well as ongoing operating leverage in key markets outside of north america 

selling general and administrative expenses 

selling general and administrative expenses for 2017  decreased 260 million  or 152  the yearoveryear decrease is primarily driven by the sale of pse during the first quarter of 2017 the sale of the capco consulting business and risk and compliance consulting business during the third quarter of 2017 and integration and cost management initiatives 

selling general and administrative expenses for 2016  increased 608 million  or 552  primarily resulting from incremental expenses associated with the sungard acquisition and transaction costs severance and costs of integration activities relating to acquisitions totaling 281 million 

operating income 

operating income totaled 1492 million  1298 million  and 1099 million  for 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively operating income as a percentage of revenue “operating margin” was 164  140  and 167  for 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively the annual changes in operating income resulted from the revenue and cost variances addressed above the increase in operating margin resulted primarily from integration and cost management initiatives and revenue from higher margin item processing solutions 

total other income expense 

interest expense is typically the primary component of total other income expense however during 2017 other income expense was also a significant component 

the decrease of 44 million  in interest expense in 2017  as compared to 2016  is primarily due to lower outstanding debt and lower weighted average interest rate on the outstanding debt 

the increase of 204 million  in interest expense in 2016  as compared to 2015  is primarily due to higher outstanding debt associated with financing the sungard acquisition partially offset by lower borrowing rates as the result of the debt refinancing activity undertaken during 2016 

other income expense net for 2017 includes 1 a pretax charge of 171 million in tender premiums and the writeoff of previously capitalized debt issuance costs on the repurchase of approximately 2000 million in aggregate principal of debt securities 2 a net pretax loss of 29 million on the sale of the capco consulting and risk and compliance business and other divestitures 3 a pretax charge of approximately 25 million due to the redemption of the senior notes due march 2022 and the pay down of the 2018 term loans consisting of the call premium on the senior notes due march 2022 and the writeoff of 

 39 

previously capitalized debt issuance costs partially offset by 4 a pretax gain of 85 million on the sale of the pse business an 8 million pretax gain on an investment sale and a 12 million foreign currency gain 

during 2016 fis paid down the 2017 term loans and partially paid down the 2018 term loans resulting in a pretax charge upon extinguishment of approximately 2 million  due to the writeoff associated with previously capitalized debt issue costs additionally in 2016 as a result of these debt pay downs fis terminated interest rate swaps with a notional amount totaling 1250 million  resulting in a pretax loss of 2 million  due to the release of fair value changes from other comprehensive earnings both of the charges were included in other income expense net

liquidity and capital resources 

cash requirements 

our ongoing cash requirements include operating expenses income taxes mandatory debt service payments capital expenditures stockholder dividends working capital and timing differences in settlementrelated assets and liabilities and may include discretionary debt repayments share repurchases and business acquisitions our cash requirements also include payments for labor claims related to fis former item processing and remittance operations in brazil see note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements our principal sources of funds are cash generated by operations and borrowings including the capacity under our revolving loan described in note 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

as of december 31 2017  we had cash and cash equivalents of 665 million  and debt of 8763 million  including the current portion net of capitalized debt issuance costs of the 665 million  cash and cash equivalents approximately 415 million  is held by our foreign entities the majority of our domestic cash and cash equivalents represents net depositsintransit at the balance sheet dates and relates to daily settlement activity we expect that cash and cash equivalents plus cash flows from operations over the next twelve months will be sufficient to fund our operating cash requirements capital expenditures and mandatory debt service 

we currently expect to continue to pay quarterly dividends however the amount declaration and payment of future dividends is at the discretion of the board of directors and depends on among other things our investment opportunities results of operations financial condition cash requirements future prospects and other factors that may be considered relevant by our board of directors including legal and contractual restrictions additionally the payment of cash dividends may be limited by covenants in certain debt agreements a regular quarterly dividend of 032 per common share is payable on march 30 2018 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on march 16 2018 

cash flows from operations 

cash flows from operations were 1741 million  1925 million  and 1131 million  in 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively our net cash provided by operating activities consists primarily of net earnings adjusted to add back depreciation and amortization cash flows from operations decreased 184 million  in 2017  and increased 794 million  in 2016  the 2017  decrease in cash flows from operations is primarily due to increased trade receivables resulting from timing differences in billing and collections and increased deferred contract costs the 2016  increase in cash flows from operations is primarily due to increased net earnings after the add back of noncash depreciation and amortization as a result of sungard operations being included for the full year 

capital expenditures and other investing activities 

our principal capital expenditures are for computer software purchased and internally developed and additions to property and equipment we invested approximately 613 million  616 million  and 415 million  in capital expenditures during 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively we expect to invest approximately 7 of 2018 revenue in capital expenditures 

in 2017 cash provided by net proceeds from sale of businesses relates to the sale of pse and the capco consulting and risk and compliance businesses in 2016 and 2015 we used 0 million and 1720 million  of cash respectively for acquisitions and other equity investments see note 3 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the more significant items cash provided by net proceeds from sale of assets in 2015 relates principally to the sale of check warranty contracts and other assets in the gaming industry discussed in note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements

recent accounting pronouncements 

        recently adopted accounting guidance 

in september 2015 the fasb issued asu no 201516 business combinations topic 805 simplifying the accounting for measurementperiod adjustments asu 201516 asu 201516 requires adjustments to provisional amounts initially recorded in a business combination that are identified during the measurement period to be recognized in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined this includes any effect on earnings of changes in depreciation amortization or other income effects as a result of the change to the provisional amounts calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date asu 201516 also requires an entity to present separately on the face of the income statement or disclose in the notes the portion of the amount recorded in currentperiod earnings by line item that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date prior to the issuance of the standard entities were required to retrospectively apply adjustments made to provisional amounts recognized in a business combination the guidance is effective for the fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december 15 2015 this guidance requires fis to record and disclose any measurementperiod adjustments for the sungard acquisition or other future business combinations as current period adjustments as opposed to retroactive adjustments to the opening balance sheet of the acquired entity 

in november 2015 the fasb issued asu no 201517 asu 201517 income taxes topic 740 balance sheet classification of deferred taxes the amendment is intended to simplify the presentation of deferred taxes on the balance sheet under the new guidance deferred tax assets and liabilities are to be classified as noncurrent assets and liabilities this replaces the current guidance which requires the deferred tax assets and liabilities to be presented as current and noncurrent for public companies the amendments are effective for annual periods beginning after december 15 2016 and interim periods within those annual periods thus asu 201517 was effective for fis as of january 1 2017 fis applied prospectively the recording of deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent and therefore prior periods have not been adjusted 

 44 

on march 30 2016 the fasb issued asu no 201609 “asu 201609” “compensation  stock compensation topic 718 improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting” the amendments were intended to simplify and improve the accounting for employee sharebased payments under the new guidance all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies overunder compensation expense recognized will be reflected in the income statement as they occur this will replace the prior guidance which required tax benefits that exceed compensation expense windfalls to be recognized in equity it also eliminates the need to maintain a “windfall pool” and removes the requirement to delay recognizing a windfall until it reduces current taxes payable the new guidance also changes the cash flow presentation of excess tax benefits classifying them as operating inflows consistent with other cash flows related to income taxes under prior guidance windfalls were classified as financing activities these changes may result in more volatile net earnings similarly effective tax rates are subject to more variability since the new guidance reflects all tax benefit excesses and deficiencies in tax expense under prior practice stock compensation generally did not impact the effective tax rate since any difference between compensation expense and the ultimate tax deduction was reflected in additional paid in capital also under the new guidance excess tax benefits are no longer to be included in assumed proceeds from applying the treasury stock method when computing diluted earnings per share since they no longer are recognized in additional paid in capital consequently the reduction to common stock equivalents for assumed purchases from proceeds are lower and the impact of common stock equivalents are more dilutive for public companies the amendments are effective for annual periods beginning after december 15 2016 and interim periods within those annual periods thus asu 201609 was effective for fis as of january 1 2017 fis applied prospectively the recording of excess tax benefits as income tax expense and the presentation of those benefits as an operating activity within the statement of cash flows and therefore prior periods have not been adjusted during 2016 and 2015 we recorded 32 million and 29 million respectively to consolidated equity as excess tax benefits from our stock plans 

on august 26 2016 the fasb issued asu no 201615 “asu 201615 “statement of cash flows topic 230 classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments” the amendments are meant to reduce the diversity in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented in the statement of cash flows asu 201615 provides guidance as to the presentation on the statement of cash flows for eight specific cash flow issues which are 1 debt prepayment for debt extinguishment costs 2 settlement of zerocoupon debt instruments or other debt instruments with coupon interest rates that are insignificant in relation to the effective interest rate of the borrowing 3 contingent consideration payments made after a business combination 4 proceeds for the settlement of insurance claims 5 proceeds from the settlement of corporateowned life insurance policies including bankowned life insurance policies 6 distributions received from equity method investees 7 beneficial interests in securitization transactions and 8 separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle for public companies the amendments are effective for annual periods beginning after december 15 2018 and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after december 15 2019 early adoption is permitted for any organization in any interim or annual period fis elected to adopt this standard in the third quarter of 2017 fis has applied the presentation guidance above to its statements of cash flows and all adjustments have been reflected on a retrospecive basis the primary impact of adopting the new guidance is our 2017 presentation of debt prepayment and related costs being reflected in financing activities rather than operating activities this adoption impacts 2017 cash flows but had no impact on 2016 or 2015 

recent accounting guidance not yet adopted 

  

in may 2014 the fasb issued asu no 201409 “revenue from contracts with customers topic 606” “asu 201409” asu 201409 amends substantially all authoritative literature for revenue recognition including industryspecific requirements and converges the guidance under this topic with that of the international financial reporting standards it also includes guidance on accounting for the incremental costs of obtaining and costs incurred to fulfill a contract with a customer the asu implements a fivestep process for customer contract revenue recognition that focuses on transfer of control as opposed to transfer of risk and rewards the amendment also requires enhanced disclosures regarding the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenues and cash flows from contracts with customers the fasb has issued several amendments to topic 606 including further guidance on principal versus agent consideration clarification on identifying performance obligations and accounting for licenses of intellectual property 

the effective date of the standard was postponed to reporting periods beginning after december 15 2017 with early adoption allowed for reporting periods beginning after december 15 2016 we will adopt the new standard effective january 1 2018 

entities can transition to the standard with retrospective application to the earliest years presented in their financial statements retrospectively using certain practical expedients or with a cumulativeeffect adjustment as of the date of adoption we will adopt the new standard using the retrospective method with the application of certain practical expedients  

the largest impacts from the adoption of topic 606 on our revenue recognition are related to the following areas 

 45 

 

impacts related to other changes introduced by the standard were substantially less significant than those listed above 

upon retrospective application of topic 606 we estimate that our revenues will decrease by approximately 455 million and 410 million and that net income excluding tax reform impact will decrease approximately 35 million and 45 million for the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016 respectively for the year ended december 31 2017 the impact of tax reform on the application of topic 606 will result in additional tax expense of approximately 20 million due to the remeasurement of deferred tax assets we anticipate recording a net reduction to opening retained earnings of approximately 30 million as of january 1 2016 due to the cumulative impact of adopting the standard the impact of topic 606 on our 2017 and 2016 operating results may or may not be representative of the impact on subsequent years’ results 

       on february 25 2016 the fasb issued asu 201602 “leases topic 842” “asu 201602” under the new guidance lessees will be required to recognize the following for all leases with the exception of leases with a term of twelve months or less at the commencement date a a lease liability which is a lessees obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease measured on a discounted basis and b a rightofuse asset which is an asset that represents the lessee’s right to use or control the use of a specified asset for the lease term under the new guidance lessor accounting is largely unchanged the pronouncement requires a modified retrospective transition approach for leases existing at or entered into after the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements the modified retrospective approach would not require any transition accounting for leases that expire before the earliest comparative period presented a full retrospective transition approach is not permitted public business entities should apply the amendments in asu 201602 for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2018 including interim periods within those fiscal years early adoption is permitted we are currently assessing the impact the adoption of asu 201602 will have on our financial position and results of operations 

  on june 16 2016 the fasb issued asu no 201613 “asu 201613” “financial instrument  credit losses topic 326 measurements on credit losses of financial instruments” this asus primary objectives are to implement new methodology for calculating credit losses on financial instruments eg trade receivables based on expected credit losses and broadens the types of information companies must use when calculating the estimated losses under current guidance the credit losses are calculated based on multiple credit impairment objectives and recognition is delayed until the loss is probable to occur under the new guidance financial assets measured at amortized cost basis must now be shown as the net amount expected to be collected the credit loss allowance is a contravaluation account availableforsale securities should continue to be recognized in a similar manner to current gaap however the allowance should be presented as an allowance instead of a writedown of the basis of the asset for public companies that are sec filers the amendments are effective for annual periods beginning after december 15 2019 and interim periods within those annual periods early adoption is permitted for any organization in any interim or annual period beginning after december 15 2018 we do not plan to early adopt and expect that the new guidance will not have a material impact on our financial statement presentation financial position or results of operations

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risks 

tableend 

  market risk 

we are exposed to market risks primarily from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates we periodically use certain derivative financial instruments including interest rate swaps and foreign currency forward contracts to manage interest rate and foreign currency risk we do not use derivatives for trading purposes to generate income or to engage in speculative activity 

interest rate risk 

 46 

in addition to existing cash balances and cash provided by operating activities we use fixed rate and variable rate debt to finance our operations we are exposed to interest rate risk on these debt obligations and related interest rate swaps if any 

the senior notes as described in note 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements represent substantially all of our fixedrate longterm debt obligations as of december 31 2017  the carrying value of the senior notes was 8553 million  as of december 31 2017  the fair value of the senior notes was approximately 8709 million  as of december 31 2017  the potential reduction in fair value of the senior notes from a hypothetical 10  percent increase in market interest rates would not be material to the overall fair value of the debt 

our floating rate longterm debt obligations principally relate to borrowings under the fis credit agreement as defined in note 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements an increase of 100 basis points in the libor rate would increase our annual debt service under the fis credit agreement by approximately 2 million  based on principal amounts outstanding as of december 31 2017  we performed the foregoing sensitivity analysis based on the principal amount of our floating rate debt as of december 31 2017  this sensitivity analysis is based solely on the principal amount of such debt as of december 31 2017  and does not take into account any changes that occurred in the prior 12 months or that may take place in the next 12 months in the amount of our outstanding debt further in this sensitivity analysis the change in interest rates is assumed to be applicable for an entire year for comparison purposes based on principal amounts of floating rate debt outstanding as of december 31 2016  and calculated in the same manner as set forth above an increase of 100 basis points in the libor rate would have increased our annual interest expense by approximately 1 million  

as of december 31 2017 we had no outstanding interest rate swaps 

in september 2015 the company entered into treasury lock hedges with a total notional amount of 10 billion  reducing the risk of changes in the benchmark index component of the 10year treasury yield the company designated these derivatives as cash flow hedges on october 13 2015 in conjunction with the pricing of the 45 billion  senior notes the company terminated these treasury lock contracts for a cash settlement payment of 16 million  which was recorded as a component of other comprehensive earnings and will be reclassified as an adjustment to interest expense over the ten  years during which the related interest payments that were hedged will be recognized in income 

foreign currency risk 

we are exposed to foreign currency risks that arise from normal business operations these risks include the translation of local currency balances of foreign subsidiaries transaction gains and losses associated with intercompany loans with foreign subsidiaries and transactions denominated in currencies other than a locations functional currency we manage the exposure to these risks through a combination of normal operating activities and the use of foreign currency forward contracts and nonderivative investment hedges contracts are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries 

our exposure to foreign currency exchange risks generally arises from our nonus operations to the extent they are conducted in local currency changes in foreign currency exchange rates affect translations of revenues denominated in currencies other than the us dollar during the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  we generated approximately 1830 million  1909 million  and 1336 million  respectively in revenues denominated in currencies other than the us dollar the major currencies to which our revenues are exposed are the brazilian real the euro the british pound sterling and the indian rupee a 10 move in average exchange rates for these currencies assuming a simultaneous and immediate 10 change in all of such rates for the relevant period would have resulted in the following increase or decrease in our reported revenues for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  in millions 



while our results of operations have been impacted by the effects of currency fluctuations our international operations revenues and expenses are generally denominated in local currency which reduces our economic exposure to foreign exchange risk in those jurisdictions 

  

 47 

revenues included 16 million  favorable and 100 million  unfavorable and net earnings included 2 million  favorable and 10 million  unfavorable respectively of foreign currency impact during 2017  and 2016  resulting from changes in the us dollar during these years compared to the preceding year in 2018 we expect minimal foreign currency impact on our earnings 

our foreign exchange risk management policy permits the use of derivative instruments such as forward contracts and options to reduce volatility in our results of operations andor cash flows resulting from foreign exchange rate fluctuations we do not enter into foreign currency derivative instruments for trading purposes or to engage in speculative activity we do periodically enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency exposure to intercompany loans we did not have any of these derivatives as of december 31 2017  the company also utilizes nonderivative net investment hedges in order to reduce the volatility in the income statement caused by the changes in foreign currency exchange rates see note 11 of the notes to consolidated financial statements

competition 

 7 

the markets for our solutions and services are intensely competitive depending on the business line in both our ifs and gfs segments our primary competitors include internal technology departments within financial institutions and retailers data processing or software development departments of large companies or large computer manufacturers and companies that deliver software and integrated services to the financial services industry thirdparty payment processors securities exchanges asset managers card associations clearing networks or associations trust companies independent computer services firms companies that develop and deploy software applications companies owned by global banks selling new competitive solutions companies that provide customized development implementation and support services strategic consulting and technology consulting firms disruptive technology innovators and business process outsourcing companies many of these companies compete with us across multiple solutions markets and geographies some of these competitors possess greater financial sales and marketing resources than we do competitive factors impacting the success of our services across our segments include the quality of the technologybased application or service application features and functions ease of delivery and integration the ability of the provider to maintain enhance and support the applications or services price and overall relationship management we believe we compete favorably in each of these categories in addition we believe our financial services industry expertise combined with our ability to offer multiple applications services and integrated solutions to individual clients enhances our competitiveness against companies with more limited offerings 

research and development 

our research and development activities have related primarily to the design and development of processing systems and related software applications and risk management platforms we expect to continue our practice of investing an appropriate level of resources to maintain enhance and extend the functionality of our proprietary systems and existing software applications to develop new and innovative software applications and systems to address emerging technology trends in response to the needs of our clients and to enhance the capabilities of our outsourcing infrastructure in addition we intend to offer services compatible with new and emerging delivery channels

the foregoing list of laws and regulations to which our company is subject is not exhaustive and the regulatory framework governing our operations changes continuously enactment of new laws and regulations may increasingly affect the operations of our business directly and indirectly which could result in substantial regulatory compliance costs litigation expense adverse publicity andor loss of revenue

risk factors 

tableend 

in addition to the normal risks of business we are subject to significant risks and uncertainties including those listed below and others described elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k any of the risks described herein could result in a significant adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

risks related to our business and operations 

 11 

entity mergers or consolidations and business failures in the banking and financial services industry could adversely affect our business by eliminating some of our existing and potential clients and making us more dependent on a more limited number of clients 

there has been and continues to be substantial consolidation activity in the banking and financial services industry in addition many financial institutions that experienced negative operating results including some of our clients have failed these consolidations and failures reduce our number of potential clients and may reduce our number of existing clients which could adversely affect our revenues even if the events do not reduce the aggregate activities of the consolidated entities further if our clients fail andor merge with or are acquired by other entities that are not our clients or that use fewer of our services they may discontinue or reduce use of our services it is also possible that larger financial institutions resulting from consolidations would have greater leverage in negotiating terms or could decide to perform inhouse some or all of the services we currently provide or could provide any of these developments could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

if we fail to innovate or adapt our services to changes in technology or in the marketplace or if our ongoing efforts to upgrade our technology are not successful we could lose clients or our clients could lose customers and have difficulty attracting new clients for our services 

the markets for our services are characterized by constant technological changes frequent introductions of new services and evolving industry standards our future success will be significantly affected by our ability to enhance our current solutions and develop and introduce new solutions and services that address the increasingly sophisticated needs of our clients and their customers in addition as more of our revenue and market demand shifts to saas cloud bpaas and new disruptive technologies the need to keep pace with rapid technology changes becomes more acute these initiatives carry the risks associated with any new solution development effort including cost overruns delays in delivery and performance issues there can be no assurance that we will be successful in developing marketing and selling new solutions that meet these changing demands that we will not experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development introduction and marketing of these solutions or that our new solutions and their enhancements will adequately meet the demands of the marketplace and achieve market acceptance any of these developments could have an adverse impact on our future revenues andor business prospects 

we operate in a competitive business environment and if we are unable to compete effectively our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 

the market for our services is intensely competitive our competitors vary in size and in the scope and breadth of the solutions and services they offer some of our competitors have substantial resources we face direct competition from third parties and since many of our larger potential clients have historically developed their key applications inhouse and therefore view their system requirements from a makeversusbuy perspective we also often compete against our potential clients’ inhouse capacities in addition the markets in which we compete have recently attracted increasing competition from smaller startups with disruptive technologies which are receiving increasing investments global banks and businesses controlled by a combination of global banks and global internet companies that are introducing competitive products and services into the marketplace particularly in the payments area emerging technologies and increased competition may also have the effect of unbundling bank solutions and result in picking off solutions we are currently providing from our legacy systems international competitors are also now targeting and entering the us market with greater force there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors or that the competitive pressures we face in the markets in which we operate will not materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations see item i business competition  

global economic political and other conditions including business cycles and consumer confidence may adversely affect our clients or trends in consumer spending which may adversely impact the demand for our services and our revenue and profitability 

a significant portion of our revenue is derived from transaction processing fees the global transaction processing industries depend heavily upon the overall level of consumer business and government spending any change in economic factors including a sustained deterioration in general economic conditions or consumer confidence particularly in the united states or increases in interest rates in key countries in which we operate may adversely affect consumer spending including related consumer debt further reduce check writing and change credit and debit card usage and as a result adversely affect our financial performance by reducing the number or average purchase amount of transactions that we service 

 12 

when there is a slowdown or downturn in the economy a drop in stock market levels or trading volumes or an event that disrupts the financial markets our business and financial results particularly with respect to our capital markets businesses may suffer for a number of reasons customers may react to worsening conditions by reducing their capital expenditures in general or by specifically reducing their information technology spending in addition customers may curtail or discontinue trading operations delay or cancel information technology projects or seek to lower their costs by renegotiating vendor contracts moreover competitors may respond to market conditions by lowering prices and attempting to lure away our customers to lower cost solutions any more protective trade policies or actions taken by the us may also result in other countries reducing or making more expensive services permitted to be provided by us based companies if any of these circumstances remain in effect for an extended period of time there could be a material adverse effect on our financial results 

constraints within global financial markets or international regulatory requirements could constrain our financial institution clients ability to purchase our services impacting our future growth and profitability 

a significant number of our clients and potential clients may hold sovereign debt of economically struggling nations or be subject to emerging international requirements such as basel iii which could require changes in their capitalization and hence the amount of their working capital available to purchase our services these potential constraints could alter the ability of clients or potential clients to purchase our services and thus could have a significant impact on our future growth and profitability 

the sales and implementation cycles for many of our software and service offerings can be lengthy and require significant investment from both our clients and fis if we fail to close sales or if a client chooses not to complete an installation after expending significant time and resources to do so our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 

the sales and associated deployment of many of our software or service offerings often involve significant capital commitments by our clients andor fis potential clients generally commit significant resources to an evaluation of available software and services and require us to expend substantial time effort and money educating them prior to sales further as part of the sale or deployment of our software and services clients may also require fis to perform significant related services to complete a proof of concept or custom development to meet their needs all of the aforementioned activities may expend significant funds and management resources and ultimately the client may determine not to close the sale or complete the implementation if we are unsuccessful in closing sales or if the client decides not to complete an implementation after we expend significant funds and management resources or we experience delays it could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our results may fluctuate from period to period because of the lengthy and unpredictable sales cycle for our software changes in our mix of licenses and services activity by competitors and customer budgeting operational requirements or renewal cycles 

particularly with respect to gfs our operating results may fluctuate from period to period and be difficult to predict in a particular period due to the timing and magnitude of software license sales and other factors we offer a number of our software solutions on a license basis which means that the customer has the right to run the software on its own computers the customer usually makes a significant upfront payment to license software which we generally recognize as revenue when the license contract is signed and the software is delivered the size of the upfront payment often depends on a number of factors that are different for each customer such as the number of customer locations users or accounts the sales cycle for a software license may be lengthy and take unexpected turns further our customers’ business models are shifting away from paying upfront license fees to paying periodic rental fees for services thus it is difficult to predict when software sales will occur or how much revenue they will generate since there are few incremental costs associated with software sales our operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year due to the timing and magnitude of software sales our results may also vary as a result of pricing pressures increased cost of equipment the evolving and unpredictable markets in which our solutions and services are sold changes in accounting principles and competitors’ new solutions or services 

in addition there are a number of other factors that could cause our sales and results of operation to fluctuate from period to period including 

  



 13 

 

failure to obtain new clients or renew client contracts on favorable terms could adversely affect results of operations and financial condition 

we may face pricing pressure in obtaining and retaining our clients larger clients may be able to seek price reductions from us when they renew a contract when a contract is extended or when the clients business has significant volume changes they may also reduce services if they decide to move services inhouse further our smaller and midsize clients may also exert pricing pressure particularly on renewal due to pricing competition or other economic needs or pressures being experienced by the client on some occasions this pricing pressure results in lower revenue from a client than we had anticipated based on our previous agreement with that client this reduction in revenue could result in an adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

further failure to renew client contracts on favorable terms could have an adverse effect on our business our contracts with clients generally run for several years and include liquidated damage provisions that provide for early termination fees terms are generally renegotiated prior to the end of a contracts term if we are not successful in achieving a high rate of contract renewals on favorable terms our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

our business and operating results could be adversely affected if we experience business interruptions errors or failure in connection with our or thirdparty information technology and communication systems and other software and hardware used in connection with our business if we experience defects or design errors in the software solutions we offer or more generally if the thirdparty vendors we rely upon are unwilling or unable to provide the services we need to effectively operate our business 

many of our services including our transformation services are based on sophisticated software and computing systems and we may encounter delays when developing new technology solutions and services further the technology solutions underlying our services have occasionally contained and may in the future contain undetected errors or defects when first introduced or when new versions are released in addition we may experience difficulties in installing or integrating our technologies on platforms used by our clients or our clients may cancel a project after we have expended significant effort and resources to complete an installation finally our systems and operations could be exposed to damage or interruption from fire natural disaster power loss telecommunications failure unauthorized entry and computer viruses defects in our technology solutions errors or delays in the processing of electronic transactions or other difficulties could result in i interruption of business operations ii delay in market acceptance iii additional development and remediation costs iv diversion of technical and other resources v loss of clients vi negative publicity or vii exposure to liability claims any one or more of the foregoing could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations although we attempt to limit our potential liability through controls including system redundancies security controls application development and testing controls and disclaimers and limitationofliability provisions in our license and client agreements we cannot be certain that these measures will always be successful in preventing disruption or limiting our liability 

further most of the solutions we offer are very complex software systems that are regularly updated no matter how careful the design and development complex software often contains errors and defects when first introduced and when major new updates or enhancements are released if errors or defects are discovered in current or future solutions we may not be able to correct them in a timely manner if at all in our development of updates and enhancements to our software solutions we may make a major design error that makes the solution operate incorrectly or less efficiently the failure of software to properly perform could result in the company and its clients being subjected to losses or liability including censures fines or other sanctions by the applicable regulatory authorities and we could be liable to parties who are financially harmed by those errors in addition such errors could cause the company to lose revenues lose clients or damage its reputation 

in addition we generally depend on a number of third parties both in the united states and internationally to supply elements of our systems computers research and market data connectivity communication network infrastructure other equipment and related support and maintenance we cannot be certain that any of these third parties will be able to continue providing these services to effectively meet our evolving needs if our vendors or in certain cases vendors of our customers fail to meet their obligations provide poor or untimely service or we are unable to make alternative arrangements for the provision of these services we may in turn fail to provide our services or to meet our obligations to our customers and our business financial condition and operating results could be materially harmed

the doddfrank act may result in business changes for our clients that have or could have an adverse effect on our financial condition revenues results of operations or prospects for future growth and overall business  

our clients are required to comply with numerous regulations the doddfrank act and associated durbin amendment were passed and signed into law in 2010 the doddfrank act represents a comprehensive overhaul of the regulations governing the financial services industry within the united states the doddfrank act established the cfpb and requires this and other federal agencies to implement many new regulations which have the potential to increase the amount and types of regulation on areas of our business that were not previously regulated 

several regulations and rules have or will be written and implemented as directed by the doddfrank act these rules and regulations have or will require our clients or potential clients to comply with requirements and could require us to directly comply with regulations these requirements have or could result in the need for fis to make capital investments to modify our solutions and services to facilitate our clients and potential clients compliance as well as to deploy additional processes or reporting to comply with regulations further requirements of the regulations have or could result in changes in our clients business practices and those of other marketplace participants that may alter the delivery of services to consumers which have or could impact the demand for our software and services as well as alter the type or volume of transactions that we process on behalf of our clients as a result these requirements have or could have an adverse impact on our financial condition revenues results of operations prospects for future growth and overall business 

many of our clients are subject to a regulatory environment and to industry standards that may change in a manner that reduces the types or volume of solutions or services we provide or may reduce the type or number of transactions in which our clients engage and therefore reduces our revenues 

our clients are subject to a number of government regulations and industry standards with which our services must comply our clients must ensure that our services and related solutions work within the extensive and evolving regulatory and industry requirements applicable to them federal state foreign or industry authorities could adopt laws rules or regulations affecting our clients businesses that could lead to increased operating costs and could reduce the convenience and functionality of our services possibly resulting in reduced market acceptance in addition action by regulatory authorities relating to credit availability data usage privacy or other related regulatory developments could have an adverse effect on our clients and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition revenues results of operations prospects for future growth and overall business elimination of regulatory requirements could also adversely affect the sales of our solutions designed to help clients comply with complex regulatory environments 

regulations enacted by the cfpb or state regulatory authorities such as the new york state department of financial services may require fis to adopt new business practices which may require capital investment andor incremental expenses which could impact our future operating results 

the cfpb regulates financial and nonfinancial institutions and providers to those institutions the cfpb continues to establish rules for regulating nonfinancial institution providers to ensure adequate protection of consumer privacy and to ensure consumers are not impacted by deceptive business practices the new york department of financial services has proposed new rules that would require covered financial institutions to establish and maintain cyber security programs the impact of these rules and proposed rules may require fis to be subject to additional regulation and adopt additional business practices that could require additional capital expenditures or impact our operating results 

our revenues from the sale of services to members of visa mastercard american express discover and other similar organizations are dependent upon our continued certification and sponsorship and the loss or suspension of certification or sponsorship could adversely affect our business 

in order to provide our card processing services we must be certified including applicable sponsorship by visa mastercard american express discover and other similar organizations these certifications are dependent upon our continued adherence to the standards of the issuing bodies and sponsoring member banks the member financial institutions some of which are our competitors set the standards with which we must comply if we fail to comply with these standards we could be fined our certifications could be suspended or our registration could be terminated the suspension or termination of our certifications or any changes in the rules and regulations governing visa mastercard american express discover or other similar organizations could result in a reduction in revenue or increased costs of operation which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business 

changes in card association and debit network fees or products could increase costs or otherwise limit our operations 

 15 

from time to time card associations and debit networks increase the interchange fees that they charge it is possible that competitive pressures will result in our absorption of a portion of such increases in the future which would increase our operating costs reduce our profit margin and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations furthermore the rules and regulations of the various card associations and networks prescribe certain capital requirements any increase in the capital level required would further limit our use of capital for other purposes 

interchange fees and related practices have been receiving significant legal and regulatory scrutiny worldwide the resulting regulatory changes that could occur from proposed regulations could alter the fees charged by card associations and debit networks worldwide such changes could have an adverse impact on our business or financial condition due to reductions or changes in types of transactions processed on behalf of our clients 

our securities brokerage operations are highly regulated and subject to risks that are not encountered in our other businesses 

one of our subsidiaries is an sec registered brokerdealer in the us and others are authorized by the fca to conduct certain regulated business in the uk domestic and foreign regulatory and selfregulatory organizations such as the sec the finra and the fca can among other things fine censure issue ceaseanddesist orders against and suspend or expel a brokerdealer or its officers or employees for failure to comply with the many laws and regulations that govern brokerage activities such sanctions may arise out of currentlyconducted activities or those conducted in prior periods our ability to comply with these laws and regulations is largely dependent on our establishment maintenance and enforcement of an effective brokerage compliance program failure to establish maintain and enforce the required brokerage compliance procedures even if unintentional could subject us to significant losses lead to disciplinary or other actions and tarnish our reputation regulations affecting the brokerage industry may change which could adversely affect our financial results 

we are exposed to certain risks relating to the execution services provided by our brokerage operations to our customers and counterparties which include other brokerdealers active traders hedge funds asset managers and other institutional and noninstitutional clients these risks include but are not limited to customers or counterparties failing to pay for or deliver securities trading errors the inability or failure to settle trades and trade execution system failures in our other businesses we generally can disclaim liability for trading losses that may be caused by our software but in our brokerage operations we may not be able to limit our liability for trading losses or failed trades even when we are not at fault as a result we may suffer losses that are disproportionately large compared to the relatively modest profit contributions of our brokerage operations 

if we fail to comply with applicable regulations or to meet regulatory expectations our business results of operations or financial condition could be adversely impacted 

the majority of our data processing services for financial institutions are not directly subject to federal or state regulations specifically applicable to financial institutions such as banks thrifts and credit unions however as a provider of services to these financial institutions our data processing operations are examined on a regular basis by various federal and state regulatory authorities and by international regulatory authorities such as the fca in certain jurisdictions if we fail to comply with any applicable regulations or guidelines for operations of a data services provider we could be subject to regulatory actions or rating changes may not meet contractual obligations and may suffer harm to our client relationships or reputation failure to meet the aforementioned requirements or to adapt to new requirements at the federal state or international level could inhibit our ability to retain existing clients or obtain new clients which could have an adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition 

in addition to our data processing services described above we also have business operations that store process or transmit consumer information or have direct relationships with consumers that are obligated to comply with regulations including but not limited to the federal fair credit reporting act the federal fair debt collection practices act and applicable privacy requirements further our international businesses must comply with applicable laws such as the us foreign corrupt practices act failure to maintain compliance with or adapt to changes in any of the aforementioned requirements could result in fines penalties or regulatory actions that could have an adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition 

security breaches or attacks or our failure to comply with information security laws or regulations or industry security requirements could harm our business by disrupting our delivery of services and damaging our reputation and could result in a breach of one or more client contracts 

 16 

we electronically receive process store and transmit sensitive business information of our clients in addition we collect personal consumer data such as names and addresses social security numbers drivers license numbers cardholder data and payment history records such information is necessary to support our clients’ transaction processing and to conduct our check authorization and collection businesses the uninterrupted operation of our information systems as well as the confidentiality of the customerconsumer information that resides on such systems is critical to our successful operation if we fail to maintain an adequate security infrastructure adapt to emerging security threats or implement sufficient security standards and technology to protect against security breaches the confidentiality of the information we secure could be compromised unauthorized access to our computer systems or databases could result in the theft or publication of confidential information the deletion or modification of records or could otherwise cause interruptions in our operations these risks are greater with increased information transmission over the internet and the increasing level of sophistication posed by cyber criminals 

as a provider of services to financial institutions and a provider of card processing services we are bound by the same limitations on disclosure of the information we receive from our clients as apply to the clients themselves if we fail to comply with these regulations and industry security requirements we could be exposed to suits for breach of contract governmental proceedings and the imposition of fines or prohibitions on card processing services in addition if more restrictive privacy laws rules or industry security requirements are adopted in the future on the federal or state level or by a specific industry body they could have an adverse impact on us through increased costs or restrictions on business processes any inability to prevent security or privacy breaches or the perception that such breaches may occur could cause our existing clients to lose confidence in our systems and terminate their agreements with us inhibit our ability to attract new clients result in increasing regulation or bring about other adverse consequences from the government agencies that regulate our business 

high profile payment card industry or digital banking security breaches could impact consumer payment behavior patterns in the future and reduce our card payment transaction volumes 

  we are unable to predict whether or when high profile card payment or digital banking security breaches will occur and if they occur whether consumers will transact less on their payment cards or reduce their digital banking service if consumers transact less on cards issued by our clients or reduce digital banking services and we are not able to adapt to offer our clients alternative technologies it could have a significant adverse impact on our revenue and related earnings 

misappropriation of our intellectual property and proprietary rights or a finding that our patents are invalid could impair our competitive position 

our ability to compete depends in some part upon our proprietary solutions and technology despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our services or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary or challenge the validity of our patents with governmental authorities policing unauthorized use of our proprietary rights is difficult we cannot make any assurances that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of technology or that the agreements entered into for that purpose will be enforceable effective patent trademark service mark copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our applications and services are made available online misappropriation of our intellectual property or potential litigation concerning such matters could have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 

if our applications or services are found to infringe the proprietary rights of others we may be required to change our business practices and may also become subject to significant costs and monetary penalties 

as our information technology applications and services develop we are increasingly subject to infringement claims any claims whether with or without merit could i be expensive and timeconsuming to defend ii result in an injunction or other equitable relief which could cause us to cease making licensing or using applications that incorporate the challenged intellectual property iii require us to redesign our applications if feasible iv divert management’s attention and resources and v require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements in order to obtain the right to use necessary technologies or pay damages resulting from any infringing use 

some of our solutions contain “open source” software and any failure to comply with the terms of one or more of these open source licenses could negatively affect our business 

we use a limited amount of software licensed by its authors or other third parties under socalled “open source” licenses and may continue to use such software in the future some of these licenses contain requirements that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the open source software and that we license such modifications or derivative works under the terms of a particular open source license or other license granting third parties certain rights of further use by the terms of certain open source licenses we could be required to release the source code of our 

 17 

proprietary software if we combine our proprietary software with open source software in a certain manner additionally the terms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by united states or other courts and there is a risk that these licenses could be construed in a manner that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our solutions in addition to risks related to license requirements usage of open source software can lead to greater risks than use of thirdparty commercial software as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on origin of the software we have established processes to help alleviate these risks including a review process for screening requests from our development organizations for the use of open source but we cannot be sure that all open source is submitted for approval prior to use in our solutions in addition many of the risks associated with usage of open source cannot be eliminated and could if not properly addressed negatively affect our business 

we face liability to our merchant clients if checks that we have guaranteed are dishonored by the check writer’s bank 

if checks that we have guaranteed are dishonored by the check writers banks we must reimburse our merchant clients for the checks face value and pursue collection from the check writers in some cases we recognize a liability to our merchant clients for estimated check returns and a receivable for amounts we estimate we will recover from the check writers based on historical experience and other relevant factors the estimated check returns and recovery amounts are subject to the risk that actual amounts returned may exceed our estimates and actual amounts recovered by us may be less than our estimates changes in economic conditions the risk characteristics and composition of our clients and other factors could impact our actual and projected amounts 

lack of system integrity fraudulent payments credit quality and undetected errors related to funds settlement or the availability of clearing services could result in a financial loss 

we settle funds on behalf of financial institutions other businesses and consumers and receive funds from clients card issuers payment networks and consumers on a daily basis for a variety of transaction types transactions facilitated by us include debit card credit card electronic bill payment transactions banking payments and check clearing that supports consumers financial institutions and other businesses these payment activities rely upon the technology infrastructure that facilitates the verification of activity with counterparties the facilitation of the payment as well as the detection or prevention of fraudulent payments if our continuity of operations integrity of processing or ability to detect or prevent fraudulent payments were compromised this could result in a financial loss to us in addition we rely on various financial institutions to provide ach services in support of funds settlement for certain of our solutions if we are unable to obtain such ach services in the future that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations in addition we may issue credit to consumers financial institutions or other businesses as part of the funds settlement a default on this credit by a counterparty could result in a financial loss to us furthermore if one of our clients for which we facilitate settlement suffers a fraudulent event due to an error of their controls we may suffer a financial loss if the client does not have sufficient capital to cover the loss 

failure to properly manage or mitigate risks in the operation of our wealth management businesses in the us and the uk could have adverse liability consequences 

 we have wealth management businesses in the us and uk engaged in processing securities transactions on behalf of clients and serving as a custodian failure to properly manage or mitigate risks in those operations and increased volatility in the financial markets may increase the potential for and magnitude of resulting losses including those that may arise from human errors or omissions defects or interruptions in computer or communications systems or breakdowns in processes or in internal controls human errors or omissions may include failures to comply with applicable laws or corporate policies and procedures theft fraud or misappropriation of assets whether arising from the intentional actions of internal personnel or external third parties     in addition the usbased business holds charters in the states of georgia and delaware which exposes us to further regulatory compliance requirements of the georgia department of banking and finance and the office of the commissioner of banking in the state of delaware the us wealth management business is required to hold certain levels of regulatory capital as defined by the state banking regulators in the states in which they hold a bank or trust charter delaware and georgia in the uk our platform securities and broker dealer businesses are regulated by the fca and are subject to further regulatory capital requirements we also have registered investment advisor and transfer agent businesses regulated by the sec and subject to further regulatory requirements 

our business is subject to the risks of international operations including movements in foreign currency exchange rates 

 18 

the international operations of fis represented approximately 24 of our total 2016 revenues and are largely conducted in currencies other than the us dollar including the brazilian real british pound euro and indian rupee our business and financial results could be adversely affected due to a variety of factors including 

 • unexpected or unfavorable changes in foreign laws regulatory requirements and related interpretations 

• difficulty of effective enforcement of contractual provisions in local jurisdictions 

• inadequate intellectual property protection in foreign countries 

 control regulations particularly in emerging markets 

in foreign countries particularly in those with developing economies certain business practices may exist that are prohibited by laws and regulations applicable to us such as the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and other anticorruption laws although our policies and procedures require compliance with these laws and are designed to facilitate compliance with these laws our employees contractors and agents may take actions in violation of applicable laws or our policies any such violation even if prohibited by our policies could have a material adverse effect on our business and 

reputation 

as we expand our international operations more of our clients may pay us in foreign currencies conducting business in currencies other than us dollars subjects us to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that can negatively impact our results period to period including relative to analyst estimates or guidance our primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to foreign currencies in brazil europe including the united kingdom australia and parts of asia the us dollar value of our net investments in foreign operations the periodic conversion of foreigndenominated earnings to the us dollar our reporting currency and our results of operations and in some cases cash flows could be adversely affected in a material manner by movements in foreign currency exchange rates these risks could cause an adverse effect on the business financial position and results of operations of the company 

the referendum on the united kingdom’s membership in the european union could cause disruption to and create uncertainty surrounding our business 

the referendum on the united kingdom’s the uk membership in the european union the eu referred to as “brexit” approving the exit of the united kingdom from the european union could cause disruptions to and create uncertainty surrounding our business including affecting our relationships with our existing and future clients suppliers and employees which could have an adverse effect on our business financial results and operations while the referendum is nonbinding the uk government has announced that it intends to commence negotiations to determine the future terms of the uk’s relationship with the eu including the terms of trade between the uk and the eu and other nations the effects of brexit will depend on any agreements the uk makes to retain access to eu markets either during a transitional period or more permanently in addition because the terms of trade between the uk and jurisdictions other than the eu may be currently governed by trade agreements between the eu and such other jurisdictions the uk may be required to negotiate new terms of trade with such other jurisdictions these potential measures could disrupt the markets we serve and the tax jurisdictions in which we operate and adversely change tax benefits or liabilities in these or other jurisdictions and may cause us to lose clients suppliers and employees in addition brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the uk determines which eu laws to replace or replicate 

the announcement of brexit caused initial volatility in global stock markets and currency exchange rate fluctuations that resulted in the strengthening of the us dollar against foreign currencies in which we conduct business the strengthening of the us dollar relative to other currencies may adversely affect our results of operations in a number of ways including 

 19 

 

actions to implement brexit may also create global economic uncertainty which may cause our clients to closely monitor their costs and reduce their spending on our solutions and services 

any of these effects of brexit among others could materially adversely affect our business business opportunities results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we have businesses in emerging markets that may experience significant economic volatility 

 we have operations in emerging markets primarily in brazil india southeast asia the middle east and africa these emerging market economies tend to be more volatile than the more established markets we serve in north america and europe which could add volatility to our future revenues and earnings 

failure to attract and retain skilled technical employees or senior management personnel could harm our ability to grow 

our future success depends upon our ability to attract and retain highlyskilled technical personnel because the development of our solutions and services requires knowledge of computer hardware operating system software system management software and application software our technical personnel must be proficient in a number of disciplines competition for such technical personnel is intense and our failure to hire and retain talented personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

our future growth will also require sales and marketing financial and administrative personnel to develop and support new solutions and services to enhance and support current solutions and services and to expand operational and financial systems there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain the necessary personnel to accomplish our growth strategies and we may experience constraints that could adversely affect our ability to satisfy client demand in a timely fashion 

our ability to maintain compliance with applicable laws rules and regulations and to manage and monitor the risks facing our business relies upon the ability to maintain skilled compliance security risk and audit professionals competition for such skillsets is intense and our failure to hire and retain talented personnel could have an adverse effect on our internal control environment and impact our operating results 

our senior management team has significant experience in the financial services industry and the loss of this leadership could have an adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition further the loss of this leadership may have an adverse impact on senior managements ability to provide effective oversight and strategic direction for all key functions within the company which could impact our future business operating results and financial condition 

we are the subject of various legal proceedings that could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability 

we are involved in various litigation matters including in some cases classaction and patent infringement litigation if we are unsuccessful in our defense of litigation matters we may be forced to pay damages andor change our business practices any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

 unfavorable resolution of tax contingencies or unfavorable future tax law changes could adversely affect our tax expense 

our tax returns and positions are subject to review and audit by federal state local and international taxing authorities an unfavorable outcome to a tax audit could result in higher tax expense and could negatively impact our effective tax rate financial position results of operations and cash flows in the current andor future periods unfavorable future tax law changes could also result in these negative impacts in addition taxlaw amendments in the united states and other jurisdictions could significantly impact how united states multinational corporations are taxed although we cannot predict whether or in what form such legislation will pass if enacted it could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 

 20 

a material weakness in our internal controls could have a material adverse effect on us 

effectiv e  internal controls are necessary for us to provide reasonable assurance with respect to our financial reports and to adequately mitigate risk of fraud if we cannot provide reasonable assurance with respect to our financial reports and adequately mitigate risk of fraud our reputation and operating results could be harmed internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations including the possibility of human error the circumvention or overriding of controls or fraud therefore even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements in addition projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

  

a material weakness is a deficiency or combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting could adversely impact our ability to provide timely and accurate financial information if we are unable to report financial information timely and accurately or to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures we could be subject to among other things regulatory or enforcement actions by the sec any one of which could adversely affect our business prospects 

risks related to business combinations and ventures 

we continue to incur substantial expenses related to the sungard acquisition which was completed on november 30 2015 and the integration of sungard 

we continue to incur substantial expenses in connection with the integration of sungard we continue to integrate a large number of processes policies procedures operations technologies and systems including information technology data centers purchasing accounting and finance sales billing information security risk legal marketing and human resources including payroll and employee benefits while we have attempted to estimate the aftertax integration and restructuring costs and other costs incurred to execute the transaction following completion of the sungard acquisition many of the expenses that will be incurred are by their nature difficult to estimate accurately although we expect that the realization of efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses will offset incremental transaction mergerrelated and restructuring costs over time we cannot give any assurance that this net benefit will be achieved in the near term or at all 

there could be significant liability for us if all or part of the as splitoff were determined to be taxable for us federal or state income tax purposes 

on march 31 2014 sungard completed the splitoff of its availability services as business to its existing stockholders including its private equity owners on a taxfree and prorata basis the “as splitoff” at the time sungard received opinions from outside tax counsel to the effect that the as splitoff should qualify for taxfree treatment as transactions described in section 355 and related provisions of the internal revenue code as amended the “code” in addition actions taken following the as splitoff including the sungard acquisition and certain 50 percent or greater changes by vote or value of the stock ownership of the new entity conducting the as business may cause the as splitoff to be taxable to fis in connection with the sungard acquisition we and sungard received opinions of outside tax counsel to the effect that the sungard acquisition should not cause the as splitoff to fail to so qualify 

notwithstanding the receipt of tax opinions the taxfree treatment of the as splitoff is not free from doubt and there is a risk that the internal revenue service the “irs” a state taxing authority or a court could conclude to the contrary that the separation of the as business from sungard may not qualify as taxfree transactions an opinion of tax counsel is not binding on the irs state taxing authorities or any court and as a result there can be no assurance that a tax authority will not challenge the taxfree treatment of all or part of the as splitoff or that if litigated a court would not agree with the irs or a state taxing authority further these tax opinions rely on certain facts assumptions representations warranties and covenants from sungard the new entity conducting the as business and from some of sungard’s stockholders regarding the past and future conduct of the companies’ respective businesses share ownership and other matters if any of the facts assumptions representations warranties and covenants on which the opinions rely is inaccurate or incomplete or not satisfied the opinions may no longer be valid moreover the irs or state taxing authority could determine on audit that the as splitoff is taxable if it determines that any of these facts assumptions representations warranties or covenants are not correct or have been violated or if it disagrees with one or more conclusions in the opinions or for other reasons 

if the as splitoff is determined to be taxable we and possibly our stockholders could incur significant income tax liabilities these tax liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 21 

actions taken by sungard availability services capital inc or its stockholders could cause the as splitoff to fail to qualify as a taxfree transaction and sungard availability services capital inc may be unable to fully indemnify sungard for the resulting significant tax liabilities 

pursuant to the tax sharing and disaffiliation agreement “tax sharing agreement” that sungard entered into with sungard availability services capital inc “spinco” spinco is required to indemnify sungard for certain taxes relating to the as splitoff that result from i any breach of the representations or the covenants made by spinco regarding the preservation of the intended taxfree treatment of the as splitoff ii any action or omission that is inconsistent with the representations statements warranties and covenants provided to tax counsel in connection with their delivery of tax opinions to sungard with respect to the as splitoff and iii any other action or omission that was likely to give rise to such taxes when taken in each case by spinco or any of its subsidiaries conversely if any such taxes are the result of such a breach or certain other actions or omissions by sungard sungard would be wholly responsible for such taxes in addition if any part of the as splitoff fails to qualify for the intended taxfree treatment for reasons other than those for which sungard or spinco would be wholly responsible pursuant to the provisions described above spinco will be obligated to indemnify sungard for 23 of the liability for taxes imposed in respect of the as splitoff and sungard would bear the remainder of such taxes if spinco is required to indemnify sungard for any of the foregoing reasons spinco’s indemnification liabilities could potentially exceed its net asset value and spinco may be unable to fully reimburse or indemnify sungard for its significant tax liabilities arising from the as splitoff as provided by the tax sharing agreement 

we have a substantial investment in our brazilian venture and obtain significant revenue through that venture that would be lost and result in significant termination costs if our venture partner were to terminate the agreement 

brazilian venture revenue attributable to our brazilian venture partner banco bradesco was 245 million  in 2016 the contract that we have with our brazilian venture partner allows for the termination or partial termination of the contract at any point during the 10year term which ends september 30 2020 this risk of contract termination is reduced by guaranteed performance targets and minimum payments that would be triggered upon the event of an early termination these payments have been established based on fis expected rate of return for the contract over a 10year period the required payments and buyouts decline each year and are further reduced by returns in excess of the expected returns for the contract and reduce the overall barrier to exiting the venture if our partner were to exit the agreement this could have a significant impact on our future revenue and growth for further detail on our brazilian venture see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements 

additionally we employ approximately 10000 employees in brazil who would have the ability to file labor claims if their employment is terminated if our brazilian venture partner were to terminate the agreement we and they may be subject to labor claims filed by employees of the brazilian venture these claims if realized could result in a significant cost and impact to our earnings 

we have substantial investments in recorded goodwill and other intangible assets as a result of prior acquisitions and a severe or extended economic downturn could cause these investments to become impaired requiring writedowns that would reduce our operating income 

as of december 31 2016 goodwill aggregated to 142 billion  or 545  of total assets and other indefinitelived intangible assets aggregated to 80 million  or 03  of total assets current accounting rules require goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets to be assessed for impairment at least annually or whenever changes in circumstances indicate potential impairment factors that may be considered a change in circumstance include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results a significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization and negative industry or economic trends the results of our 2016 annual assessment of the recoverability of goodwill indicated that the fair values of the company’s reporting units were in excess of the carrying values of those reporting units and thus no goodwill impairment existed as of december 31 2016 likewise the fair value of indefinitelived intangible assets was also in excess of the carrying value of those assets as of december 31 2016 however if worldwide or united states economic conditions decline significantly with negative impacts to bank spending and consumer behavior  or if other business or market changes impact our outlook  the carrying amount of our goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets may no longer be recoverable and we may be required to record an impairment charge which would have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

as of december 31 2016 intangible assets with finite useful lives aggregated to 4584 million  or 176  of total assets current accounting rules require intangible assets with finite useful lives to be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable factors that may be considered 

 22 

a change in circumstance include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results a significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization and negative industry or economic trends 

we will continue to monitor the fair value of our intangible assets as well as our market capitalization and the impact of any economic downturn on our business to determine if there is an impairment in future periods 

risks related to our indebtedness 

our existing debt levels and future levels under existing facilities and debt service requirements may adversely affect our financial condition or operational flexibility and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our outstanding indebtedness 

as of december 31 2016 we had total debt of approximately 105 billion  this level of debt or any increase in our debt level could have adverse consequences for our business financial condition operating results and operational flexibility including the following i the debt level may cause us to have difficulty borrowing money in the future for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions or other purposes ii our debt level may limit operational flexibility and our ability to pursue business opportunities and implement certain business strategies iii some of our debt has a variable rate of interest which exposes us to the risk of increased interest rates iv we have a higher level of debt than some of our competitors or potential competitors which may cause a competitive disadvantage and may reduce flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions including increased competition and vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  v there are significant maturities on our debt that we may not be able to repay at maturity or that may be refinanced at higher rates and vi  if we fail to satisfy our obligations under our outstanding debt or fail to comply with the financial or other restrictive covenants contained in the indenture governing our senior notes or our credit facility an event of default could result that could cause all of our debt to become due and payable

       in 2015 fis finalized a reorganization and began reporting its financial performance based on three segments integrated financial solutions “ifs” global financial solutions “gfs” and corporate and other we recast all previous periods to 

conform to the new segment presentation following our november 30 2015 acquisition of sungard the sungard business was included within the gfs segment as its economic characteristics international business model and various 

other factors largely aligned with those of our gfs segment as we further integrated the acquired sungard businesses through march 31 2016 we reclassified certain sungard businesses corporate liquidity and wealth management that are 

oriented more to the retail banking and payments activities of ifs into that segment certain other businesses from both sungard public sector and education businesses which was divested in february 2017 and legacy fis global commercial services and retail check processing were reclassified to the corporate and other segment as have sungard administrative expenses prior periods also have been reclassified to conform to the current segment presentation a description of these segments is included in note 19 of the notes to consolidated financial statements revenues by segment and the results of operations of our segments are discussed below in segment results of operations 

  

business trends and conditions 

our revenue is primarily derived from a combination of recurring technology and processing services consulting and professional services and software license fees the majority of our revenue has historically been recurring provided under multiyear contracts that contribute relative stability to our revenue stream these services in general are considered critical to our clients operations a considerable portion of these recurring revenues is derived from transaction processing fees that fluctuate with the level of accounts and card transactions among other variable measures associated with consumer commercial capital markets and trading volume activity consulting and professional services revenues are typically nonrecurring and sales of software licenses are less predictable a portion of which can be regarded as discretionary spending by our clients in 2016 macroeconomic challenges of a slowing global economy as well as unique events such as brexit affected our clients by predominantly delaying their buying decisions of consulting and professional services in certain markets 

       the sungard acquisition broadened our solution portfolio enabling us to expand beyond our traditional retail banking and payments markets into the institutional and wholesale side of financial institutions as well as other buyside organizations it significantly expanded our existing solutions and client base in wealth management treasury and corporate payments these solutions are in demand among our regional and community financial institution clients as they look for ways to replace highly regulated fee revenues the combination also favorably impacted our revenue mix with a greater concentration of license revenues and higher margin services as we continue to integrate sungard into our existing operations we anticipate 

 30 

significant cost savings around administration and technology expenses with a goal of achieving annual synergy runrate savings of more than 275 million by the end of 2017 

  

we are actively migrating many financial institutions to outsourced integrated technology solutions to improve their profitability and address increasing and ongoing regulatory requirements as a provider of outsourcing solutions we benefit from multiyear recurring revenue streams which help moderate the effects of broader yeartoyear economic and market changes that otherwise might have a larger impact on our results of operations we believe our integrated solutions and outsourced services are well positioned to address this outsourcing trend across the markets we serve 

  

consumer preference continues to shift from traditional branch banking services to digital banking solutions and our clients seek to provide a single integrated banking experience through their branch mobile internet and voice banking channels we are focused on enabling our clients to deliver this experience to their customers through our integrated solutions and services we continue to innovate and invest in these integrated solutions and services to assist clients as they address this market demand this is an area of increased competition from global banks international providers and disruptive technology innovators 

  

we continue to see demand for innovative solutions in the payments market that will deliver faster more convenient payment solutions in mobile channels internet applications and cards we believe digital payments will grow and partially replace existing payment tender volumes over time as consumers and merchants embrace the convenience incremental services and benefits digital payment volume is growing significantly but does not yet represent a meaningful amount of the payments market additionally new formidable nontraditional payments competitors and large merchants are investing in and innovating digital payment technologies to address the emerging market opportunity and it is unclear the extent to which particular technologies or services will succeed we believe the growth of digital payments continues to present both an opportunity and a risk to us as the market develops although we cannot predict which digital payment technologies or solutions will be successful we cautiously believe our client relationships payments infrastructure and experience adapted solutions and emerging solutions are well positioned to maintain or grow our clients existing payment volumes which is our focus 

high profile north american merchant payment card information security breaches have pushed the payment card industry towards emv integrated circuit cards as financial institutions card networks and merchants seek to improve information security and reduce fraud costs we invested in our card management solutions and card manufacturing and processing capabilities to accommodate emv integrated circuit cards so we can continue to guide our clients through this technology transition and grow our card driven businesses we believe the trend to migrate to emv cards will continue 

the use of checks continues to decline as a percentage of total payments which negatively impacts our check warranty and itemprocessing businesses and we expect this trend to continue in 2016 we saw a continued slowdown and decline in our check volumes 

we anticipate consolidation within the banking industry will continue primarily in the form of merger and acquisition activity which we believe as a whole is detrimental to our business however consolidation resulting from specific merger and acquisition transactions may be beneficial or detrimental to our business when consolidations of financial institutions occur merger partners often operate systems obtained from competing service providers the newly formed entity generally makes a determination to migrate its core and payments systems to a single platform when a financial institution processing client is involved in a consolidation we may benefit by their expanding the use of our services if such services are chosen to survive the consolidation and support the newly combined entity conversely we may lose market share if we are providing services to both entities or if a client of ours is involved in a consolidation and our services are not chosen to survive the consolidation and support the newly combined entity it is also possible that larger financial institutions resulting from consolidation may have greater leverage in negotiating terms or could decide to perform inhouse some or all of the services that we currently provide or could provide we seek to mitigate the risks of consolidations by offering other competitive services to take advantage of specific opportunities at the surviving company in 2016 consolidations resulted in our earning termination fees which are paid to us when customers leave slightly higher than the previous year 

notwithstanding challenging global economic conditions our international business continued to experience growth across all major regions especially brazil and asia on a constant currency basis during the year ended december 31 2016 by comparison with fis a greater percentage of sungards revenues have been contributed historically by international markets which contributed to this growth trend demand for our solutions will also be driven in developing countries by governmentled financial inclusion policies aimed to reduce the unbanked population and by growth in the middle classes in these markets driving the need for more sophisticated banking solutions the majority of our european revenue is generated by clients in the united kingdom france and germany in 2016 we experienced adverse currency impacts in our international businesses as a 

 31 

consequence of a relative strengthening of the us dollar particularly versus the british pound sterling due in part to brexit in 2017 we expect continued unfavorable foreign currency impacts 

  

information security 

globally attacks on information technology systems continue to grow in frequency complexity and sophistication this is a trend we expect to continue such attacks have become a point of focus for individuals businesses and governmental entities the objectives of these attacks include among other things gaining unauthorized access to systems to facilitate financial fraud disrupt operations cause denial of service events corrupt data and steal nonpublic information these circumstances present both a threat and an opportunity for fis as part of our business we electronically receive process store and transmit a wide range of confidential information including sensitive customer information and personal consumer data we also operate payment cash access and prepaid card systems 

fis remains focused on making strategic investments in information security to protect our clients and our information systems this includes both capital expenditures and operating expense on hardware software personnel and consulting services we also participate in industry and governmental initiatives to improve information security for our clients through the expertise we have gained with this ongoing focus and involvement we have developed fraud security risk management and compliance solutions to target this growth opportunity in the financial services industry 

critical accounting policies 

the accounting policies described below are those we consider critical in preparing our consolidated financial statements these policies require management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures with respect to contingent liabilities and assets at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods actual amounts could differ from those estimates see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed description of the significant accounting policies that have been followed in preparing our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

the company generates revenues from the delivery of bank processing credit and debit card processing services other payment processing services professional services software licensing software as a service saas business process as a service bpaas cloud revenue and software related services revenues are recognized when evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred fees are fixed or determinable and collection is considered probable each of these primary revenue recognition criteria requires exercising an appropriate level of judgment we are frequently a party to multiple concurrent contracts with the same client these situations require judgment to determine whether the individual contracts should be aggregated or evaluated separately for purposes of revenue recognition in making this determination we consider the timing of negotiating and executing the contracts whether the different elements of the contracts are interdependent and whether any of the payment terms of the contracts are interrelated our individual contracts also frequently include multiple elements we must apply judgment in these circumstances in determining whether individual elements can be considered separate units of accounting or should instead be accounted for in combination with other deliverables judgment is also required in ascribing fair value to each deliverable for purposes of allocating consideration 

for certain agreements we use contract accounting if the arrangement with the customer includes significant customization modification or production of software for these arrangements we use the percentageofcompletion method which requires the use of reasonable estimates of total revenues and contract hours these estimates are revised and updated at each reporting period additionally a small percentage of revenues including some equipment sales and merchant interchange fees are recognized on a netofcost basis because the company is not the primary obligor among other criteria the determination of gross versus net recognition requires judgment in evaluating the companys contractual obligations to the customer 

due to the large number broad nature and average size of individual contracts we are party to the impact of judgments and assumptions that we apply in recognizing revenue for any single contract is not likely to have a material effect on our consolidated operations or financial position however the broader accounting policy assumptions that we apply across similar arrangements or classes of clients could significantly influence the timing and amount of revenue recognized in our historical and future results of operations or financial position additional information about our revenue recognition policies is included in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements 

computer software 

 32 

computer software includes the fair value of software acquired in business combinations purchased software and capitalized software development costs purchased software is recorded at cost and amortized using the straightline method over its estimated useful life which is generally three to five years software acquired in business combinations is recorded at its fair value and amortized using straightline or accelerated methods over its estimated useful life which is three to ten years the determination of fair value as part of the business combination purchase price allocation is complex and requires significant judgment for any material acquisition we engage independent valuation specialists to assist in making fair value determinations the valuation technique most often applied for acquired software is a relief from royalty income approach this approach requires forecasts estimates and assumptions about future revenue streams appropriate royalty rates and the rate at which the underlying technology becomes obsolete in addition the income approach requires the use of risk adjusted discount rates and estimated future tax rates as of december 31 2016 and december 31 2015 computer software net of accumulated amortization was 16 billion  and 16 billion  respectively and amortization of computer software was 396 million  229 million  and 210 million  for the years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively balances related to acquired software represent a significant portion of these balances particularly for the periods after the acquisition of sungard which resulted in acquired software of 674 million  

the capitalization of software development costs is governed by fasb asc subtopic 98520 if the software is to be sold leased or otherwise marketed or by fasb asc subtopic 35040 if the software is for internal use after the technological feasibility of the software has been established for software to be marketed or at the beginning of application development for internaluse software software development costs which include primarily salaries and related payroll costs and costs of independent contractors incurred during development are capitalized research and development costs incurred prior to the establishment of technological feasibility for software to be marketed or prior to application development for internaluse software are expensed as incurred evaluating whether technological feasibility has been achieved requires the use of management judgment 

software development costs are amortized on a productbyproduct basis commencing on the date of general release of the solutions for software to be marketed or the date placed in service for internaluse software software development costs for software to be marketed are amortized using the greater of 1 the straightline method over its estimated useful life which ranges from three to 10 years or 2 the ratio of current revenues to total anticipated revenues over its useful life 

in determining useful lives management considers historical results and technological trends that may influence the estimate useful lives for all computer software range from three to 10 years 

we also assess the recorded value of computer software for impairment on a regular basis by comparing the carrying value to the estimated future cash flows to be generated by the underlying software asset for software to be marketed there are inherent uncertainties in determining the expected useful life or cash flows to be generated from computer software for the years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively we have not had more than minimal charges for impairments of software while we have not historically experienced significant changes in these balances due to changes in estimates our results of operations could be subject to such changes in the future 

purchase accounting goodwill and other intangible assets 

we are required to allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction at their estimated fair values the estimates used to determine the fair value of longlived assets such as intangible assets are complex and require a significant amount of management judgment we generally engage independent valuation specialists to assist us in making fair value determinations 

if the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the combination occurs we are required to record provisional amounts in the financial statements for the items for which the accounting is incomplete adjustments to provisional amounts initially recorded that are identified during the measurement period are recognized in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined this includes any effect on earnings of changes in depreciation amortization or other income effects as a result of the change to the provisional amounts calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date during the measurement period we are also required to recognize additional assets or liabilities if new information is obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that if known would have resulted in the recognition of those assets and liabilities as of that date the measurement period ends the sooner of one year from the combination date or when we receive the information we were seeking about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date or we learn that more information is not obtainable 

 33 

we are also required to estimate the useful lives of intangible assets to determine the amount of acquisitionrelated intangible asset amortization expense to record in future periods we periodically review the estimated useful lives assigned to our finitelived intangible assets to determine whether such estimated useful lives continue to be appropriate additionally we review our indefinitelived intangible assets to determine if there is any change in circumstances that may indicate the asset’s useful life is no longer indefinite 

goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives should not be amortized but shall be tested for impairment annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate potential impairment fasb asc topic 350 allows an entity first to assess qualitatively whether it is more likely than not that a reporting units carrying amount exceeds its fair value referred to in the guidance as step zero if an entity concludes that it is more likely than not that a reporting units fair value is less than its carrying amount that is a likelihood of more than 50 percent the step one quantitative assessment must be performed for that reporting unit asc topic 350 provides examples of events and circumstances that should be considered in performing the step zero qualitative assessment including macroeconomic conditions industry and market considerations cost factors overall financial performance events affecting a reporting unit or the entity as a whole and a sustained decrease in share price   

in applying the quantitative analysis we determine the fair value of our reporting units based on a weighted average of multiple valuation techniques principally a combination of an income approach and a market approach the income approach calculates a value based upon the present value of estimated future cash flows while the market approach uses earnings multiples of similarly situated guideline public companies if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the reporting unit’s net assets goodwill is not impaired and further testing is not required we engaged independent specialists to perform valuations of our reporting units effective january 1 2015 in conjunction with our resegmentation and prior to that in 2012 as part of our annual impairment test there was a substantial excess of fair value over carrying value for each of our reporting units in both the 2015 and 2012 independent valuations 

in conjunction with the organizational modifications in the first quarter of 2016 we reallocated goodwill associated with the reclassified businesses based on relative fair values as of january 1 2016 we refreshed our step zero qualitative analysis identifying no indications of impairment for any of our reporting units 

  we assess goodwill for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter using a september 30 measurement date unless circumstances require a more frequent measurement as was the case in the first quarter of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016 for each of 2016 2015 and 2014 we began our annual impairment test with the step zero qualitative analysis in performing the step zero qualitative analysis for each year examining those factors most likely to affect our valuations we concluded that it remained more likely than not that the fair value of each of our reporting units continued to exceed their carrying amounts consequently we did not perform a step one quantitative analysis specifically for the purpose of our annual impairment test in any year presented in these financial statements 

we also estimate the fair value of acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives and compare this amount to the underlying carrying value annually similar to the asc topic 350 guidance for goodwill asc section 3601035 allows an organization to first perform a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that an indefinitelived intangible asset has been impaired 

we engaged independent specialists to perform a valuation of our indefinitelived intangible assets in 2016 and 2015 and prior to that in 2012 using a form of income approach valuation known as the relieffromroyalty method for 2016 we proceeded directly to a step one quantitative analysis there was an excess of fair value over carrying value for each of our indefinite lived intangible assets in the 2016 and 2015 independent valuations for 2014 we began our assessment of indefinite lived intangibles with the step zero qualitative analysis because there was a substantial excess of fair value over carrying value for each of our indefinitelived intangible assets based on the 2012 valuation based upon the results of these assessments there were no indications of impairment 

determining the fair value of a reporting unit or acquired intangible assets with indefinitelives involves judgment and the use of significant estimates and assumptions which include assumptions regarding forecasted revenue growth rates operating margins capital expenditures tax rates and other factors used to calculate estimated future cash flows in addition riskadjusted discount rates and future economic and market conditions and other assumptions are applied goodwill was 142 billion  and 147 billion  as of the years ended december 31 2016 and 2015 respectively and indefinitelived intangibles was 80 million  and 81 million  as of the years ended december 31 2016 and 2015 respectively as a result a meaningful change in one or more of the underlying forecasts estimates or assumptions used in testing these assets for impairment could result in a material impact on the companys results of operations and financial position however because there was a substantial 

 34 

excess of fair value over carrying value in each of our previous independent valuations we believe the likelihood of obtaining materially different results based on a change of assumptions is low 

accounting for income taxes 

as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements we are required to determine income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate this process involves estimating actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing recognition of items for income tax and financial reporting purposes these differences result in deferred income tax assets and liabilities which are included within the consolidated balance sheets management uses bests estimates and assumptions available during this process 

we must then assess the likelihood that deferred income tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely establish a valuation allowance to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase or decrease this allowance in a period we must reflect this increase or decrease as an expense or benefit within income tax expense in the consolidated statements of earnings we consider history of losses forecasted earnings statutory usage limitations of the deferred tax asset and possible tax planning strategies in determining whether or not we believe a valuation allowance is necessary 

determination of the income tax expense requires estimates and can involve complex issues that may require an extended period to resolve further changes in the geographic mix of revenues or in the estimated level of annual pretax income can cause the overall effective income tax rate to vary from period to period we also receive periodic assessments from taxing authorities challenging our positions that must be taken into consideration in determining our tax reserves resolving these assessments which may or may not result in additional taxes due may also require an extended period of time we believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and we adequately account for any known tax contingencies we reserve for uncertain tax positions using a twostep process first we determine if the tax position meets the more likely than not recognition threshold based on all available evidence and second we estimate the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement we believe the estimates and assumptions used to support our evaluation of tax benefit realization are reasonable however final determination of prioryear tax liabilities either by settlement with tax authorities or expiration of statutes of limitations could be materially different than estimates reflected in assets and liabilities and historical income tax provisions the outcome of these final determinations could have a material effect on our income tax provision net income or cash flows in the period that a determination is made

processing and services revenues 

processing and services revenues for 2016 increased 2645 million  or 401  due to incremental revenues from the sungard acquisition as well as growth in our consulting business increased demand for output solutions increased card processing volumes in brazil card production activities associated with the rollout of emv cards across the industry volume growth in debit payments and demand for regulatory and compliance solutions the processing and services revenue increase was partially offset by 192 million  of purchase accounting impact on deferred revenue all of which was recorded as a contrarevenue item and 100 million of unfavorable foreign currency impact primarily resulting from a stronger us dollar versus the pound sterling and brazilian real 

  

 36 

processing and services revenues for 2015 increased 183 million  or 29  due to incremental revenues from the acquisitions of sungard clear2pay and reliance as well as card production activities associated with the rollout of emv cards across the industry and growth in digital solutions these increases were partially offset by the loss of a major customer in the prior year period the divestiture of our gaming industry check warranty business and 243 million of unfavorable foreign currency impact primarily resulting from a stronger us dollar versus the brazilian real and the euro 

cost of revenues and gross profit 

cost of revenues totaled 6233 million  4395 million  and 4327 million  during 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively resulting in gross profit of 3008 million  2201 million  and 2086 million  respectively gross profit as a percentage of revenues “gross margin” was 326  334  and 325  in 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively the increase in gross profit for 2016  as compared to 2015   primarily resulted from the revenue variances noted above the gross profit percentage for 2016  as compared to 2015  was negatively impacted by higher acquired intangible asset amortization expense and higher incentive compensation during 2016  this negative impact was partially offset by the addition of higher margin revenues from sungard as well as ongoing operating leverage in key markets outside of north america the increase in gross profit for 2015  as compared to 2014   primarily resulted from the revenue variances noted above the increase in gross profit percentage for 2015  as compared to 2014  primarily resulted from proportionately higher license fees and lower professional services and consulting revenue the restructuring activities taken earlier in 2015 in europe as a result of a reorganization and reductions in variable costs where performance did not meet expectations these items were partially offset by the impact of lower termination fees in 2015  

  

selling general and administrative expenses 

selling general and administrative expenses for 2016  increased 608 million  or 552  primarily resulting from incremental expenses associated with the sungard acquisition and transaction costs severance and costs of integration activities relating to acquisitions totaling 281 million 

selling general and administrative expenses for 2015  increased 287 million  or 352  primarily resulting from transaction costs severance and costs of integration activities relating to acquisitions totaling 171 million severance costs of 45 million in conjunction with the reorganization and streamlining of operations in our gfs segment and other incremental expenses of acquired companies 

operating income 

operating income totaled 1298 million  1099 million  and 1271 million  for 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively operating income as a percentage of revenue “operating margin” was 140  167  and 198  for 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively the annual changes in operating income and operating margin resulted from the revenue and cost variances addressed above 

total other income expense 

interest expense is the primary component of total other income expense the increase of 204 million  in interest expense in 2016  as compared to 2015  is primarily due to higher outstanding debt associated with financing the sungard acquisition partially offset by lower borrowing rates as the result of the debt refinancing activity undertaken during 2016 

the increase of 26 million  in interest expense in 2015  as compared to 2014  was primarily due to higher outstanding debt associated with financing the sungard acquisition partially offset by lower borrowing rates as the result of the debt refinancing activity undertaken during 2014  

during 2016 fis paid down the 2017 term loans and partially paid down the 2018 term loans resulting in a pretax charge upon extinguishment of approximately 2 million  due to the writeoff associated with previously capitalized debt issue costs additionally in 2016 as a result of these debt pay downs fis terminated interest rate swaps with a notional amount totaling 1250 million  resulting in a pretax loss of 2 million  due to the release of fair value changes from other comprehensive earnings both of the charges were included in other income expense net 

during the second quarter of 2015 we sold certain assets associated with our gaming industry check warranty business resulting in proceeds of 238 million and a pretax gain of 139 million which is included in other income expense net other income expense net for 2015 also includes financing costs of 17 million relating to the sungard acquisition 

 37 

other income expense net for 2014 includes a loss of 16 million on a foreign currency forward contract associated with the eurobased purchase price for our clear2pay acquisition the writeoff of certain previously capitalized debt issuance costs of 7 million and the payment of a 30 million bond premium associated with the early redemption of certain debt 

provision for income taxes 

income tax expense from continuing operations totaled 317 million  379 million  and 335 million  for 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively this resulted in an effective tax rate on continuing operations of 350  365  and 318  for 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively the effective tax rate for the 2015 period included a 90 million writeoff of goodwill with no tax basis in connection with the sale of our gaming industry check warranty business resulting in a book gain on sale lower than the tax gain during 2014 we realized tax benefits related to certain acquired net operating loss carryovers this and certain favorable audit resolutions in 2014 contributed to the rate differential for the 2014 period 

earnings loss from discontinued operations 

during 2016  2015  and 2014  certain operations are classified as discontinued as discussed in note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements reporting for discontinued operations classifies revenues and expenses as one line item net of tax in the consolidated statements of earnings the table below outlines the components of discontinued operations for 2016  2015  and 2014  net of tax in millions 



during the second quarter of 2014 the company committed to a plan to sell our business operation that provides ecas core banking software solutions to small financial institutions in china because it did not align with our strategic plans we entered into a purchase agreement in january 2015 to sell this business and the transaction closed during the second quarter of 2015  

participacoes our former item processing and remittance services business in brazil had no revenue in 2016  2015  and 2014  participacoes processing volume was transitioned to other vendors or back to its clients during the second quarter of 2011 participacoes had earnings losses before taxes of 2 million  5 million  and 10 million  during the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively the shutdown activities involved the transfer and termination of approximately 2600  employees which was completed in 2011 former employees generally had up to two years  from the date of terminations extended through april 2013 to file labor claims and a number of them did file labor claims as of december 31 2016  there were approximately 475  active claims remaining consequently we have continued exposure on these active claims which were not transferred with other assets and liabilities in the disposal 

net earnings loss attributable to noncontrolling interest 

net earnings loss attributable to noncontrolling interest predominantly relates to the joint venture in brazil see note 17 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and totaled 22 million  19 million  and 28 million  for 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively 

earnings from continuing operations net of tax attributable to fis common stockholders 

earnings from continuing operations net of tax attributable to fis common stockholders totaled 567 million  639 million  and 690 million  for 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively or 172  221  and 239  per diluted share respectively due to the factors described above coupled with the impact of our share repurchase initiatives

processing and services revenues increased 162 million  or 74  including approximately 236 million of unfavorable foreign currency impact primarily resulting from a stronger us dollar versus the brazilian real and the euro excluding the foreign currency impact revenue increases were primarily attributable to 1 incremental revenues from the acquisitions of sungard and clear2pay contributing 154 2 growth in latin america from transaction volumes card issuances and expanded back office services contributing 12 3 our expanding presence in india including core banking and payments contributing 11 and 4 growth in europe primarily in core banking and payment solutions contributing 05 

adjusted ebitda increased 71 million  or 147  primarily resulting from the revenue variances noted above adjusted ebitda margins increased 150  basis points to 234  primarily resulting from growth in high margin license deals the restructuring activities undertaken earlier in the year in europe as a result of our reorganization and reductions in variable costs where performance did not meet expectations the impact of these items was partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates 

corporate and other 



the corporate and other segment results consist of selling general and administrative expenses and depreciation and intangible asset amortization not otherwise allocated to the reportable segments corporate and other also includes operations from nonstrategic businesses including commercial services public sector and education and check authorization 

year ended december 31 2016 

processing and services revenues increased 35 million  or 90  and was primarily attributable to the additions of the businesses from the sungard acquisition contributing 612 partially offset by a 192 million  purchase accounting impact on deferred revenue all of which was recorded as a contrarevenue item in the corporate and other segment 

adjusted ebitda decreased 69 million  or 775  primarily resulting from the timing of incentives and incremental expenses of acquired companies partially offset by the revenue variances noted above higher addbacks for purchase accounting amortization acquisition integration and severance costs and deferred revenue all as detailed in note 19 

year ended december 31 2015 

processing and services revenues decreased 146 million  or 272  and was primarily attributable to a 48 million  purchase accounting impact on deferred revenue all of which was recorded as a contrarevenue item in the corporate and other segment and lower revenue in commercial services contributing 157 the impact of the divestiture of our check gaming business in the second quarter of 2015 contributing 58 and check authorization volume declines contributing 04 partially offset by the additions of the businesses from the sungard acquisition contributing 41 

adjusted ebitda decreased 51 million  or 1342  primarily resulting from the decline in revenue noted above and incremental expenses of acquired companies 

liquidity and capital resources 

cash requirements 

our ongoing cash requirements include operating expenses income taxes mandatory debt service payments capital expenditures stockholder dividends working capital and timing differences in settlementrelated assets and liabilities and may 

 40 

include discretionary debt repayments share repurchases and business acquisitions our cash requirements also include payments for capcos contingent consideration earnout and for labor claims related to fis former item processing and remittance operations in brazil see notes 3 and 15 respectively of the notes to consolidated financial statements our principal sources of funds are cash generated by operations and borrowings including the capacity under our revolving loan described in note 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

as of december 31 2016  we had cash and cash equivalents of 683 million  and debt of 10478 million  including the current portion net of capitalized debt issuance costs of the 683 million  cash and cash equivalents approximately 470 million  is held by our foreign entities and would generally be subject to us income taxation upon repatriation to the us the majority of our domestic cash and cash equivalents represents net depositsintransit at the balance sheet dates and relates to daily settlement activity we expect that cash and cash equivalents plus cash flows from operations over the next twelve months will be sufficient to fund our operating cash requirements capital expenditures and mandatory debt service 

we currently expect to continue to pay quarterly dividends however the amount declaration and payment of future dividends is at the discretion of the board of directors and depends on among other things our investment opportunities results of operations financial condition cash requirements future prospects and other factors that may be considered relevant by our board of directors including legal and contractual restrictions additionally the payment of cash dividends may be limited by covenants in certain debt agreements a regular quarterly dividend of 029 per common share is payable on march 31 2017 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on march 17 2017 

cash flows from operations 

cash flows from operations were 1925 million  1131 million  and 1165 million  in 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively our net cash provided by operating activities consists primarily of net earnings adjusted to add back depreciation and amortization cash flows from operations increased 794 million  in 2016  and decreased 34 million  in 2015  the 2016  increase in cash flows from operations is primarily due to increased net earnings after the add back of noncash depreciation and amortization as a result of sungard operations being included for the full year the 2015  decrease in cash flows from operations is primarily due to a tax payment of 88 million of income taxes relating to the sale of check warranty contracts and other assets in the gaming industry and lower net earnings partially offset by changes in working capital 

capital expenditures and other investing activities 

our principal capital expenditures are for computer software purchased and internally developed and additions to property and equipment we invested approximately 616 million  415 million  and 372 million  in capital expenditures during 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively we expect to invest approximately 67 of 2017 revenue in capital expenditures

recent accounting pronouncements 

        recently adopted accounting guidance 

in april 2014 the fasb issued asu 201408 “presentation of financial statements topic 205 and property plant and equipment topic 360 reporting discontinued operations and disclosures of disposals of components of an entity” “asu 201408” the standard raises the threshold for a disposal to qualify as a discontinued operation to one representing a strategic shift that has a major effect on the organization’s operations and financial results the standard requires new disclosures of both discontinued operations and certain other disposals that do not meet the definition of a discontinued operation asu 201408 was effective for fis as of january 1 2015 this pronouncement could impact the presentation of future divestitures that may have qualified as discontinued operations in the past but do not meet the higher threshold of asu 201408 

in september 2015 the fasb issued asu no 201516 business combinations topic 805 simplifying the accounting for measurementperiod adjustments asu 201516 asu 201516 requires adjustments to provisional amounts initially recorded in a business combination that are identified during the measurement period to be recognized in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined this includes any effect on earnings of changes in depreciation amortization or other income effects as a result of the change to the provisional amounts calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date asu 201516 also requires an entity to present separately on the face of the income statement or disclose in the notes the portion of the amount recorded in currentperiod earnings by line item that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date prior to the issuance of the standard entities were required to retrospectively apply adjustments made to provisional amounts recognized in a business combination the guidance is effective for the fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december 15 2015 this guidance requires fis to record and disclose any measurementperiod adjustments for the sungard acquisition or other future business combinations as current period adjustments as opposed to retroactive adjustments to the opening balance sheet of the acquired entity 

recent accounting guidance not yet adopted 

  

 42 

in may 2014 the fasb issued asu no 201409 “revenue from contracts with customers topic 606” “asu 201409” asu 201409 amends substantially all authoritative literature for revenue recognition including industryspecific requirements and converges the guidance under this topic with that of the international financial reporting standards the asu implements a fivestep process for customer contract revenue recognition that focuses on transfer of control as opposed to transfer of risk and rewards the amendment also requires enhanced disclosures regarding the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenues and cash flows from contracts with customers the fasb has recently issued several amendments to topic 606 including further guidance on principal versus agent considerations clarification on identifying performance obligations and accounting for licenses of intellectual property 

the effective date of the standard was postponed to reporting periods beginning after december 15 2017 with early adoption allowed for reporting periods beginning after december 15 2016 we currently anticipate adopting the new standard effective january 1 2018 

entities can transition to the standard either with retrospective application to the earlier years presented in their financial statements or with a cumulativeeffect adjustment as of the date of adoption we currently anticipate adopting the new standard using the retrospective method with the application of certain practical expedients however a final decision regarding the adoption method has not been made our decision to adopt using the retrospective method is dependent on several factors including the significance of the impact on our financial results and the completion of our analysis of information necessary to restate priorperiod financial statements  

while we are continuing to assess the impact the adoption of asu 201409 will have on our financial position and results of operations we currently anticipate the largest area of impact to relate to our accounting for set up and implementation services related to our data processing and application management service agreements currently to the extent these activities have standalone value and the related fees are not contingent on the delivery of future services they are recognized as performed under the new standard to the extent these services are not considered distinct in the context of the related service contracts the associated revenue and cost will be deferred and recognized over the estimated contract period we also anticipate that the timing of recognition of certain term license early renewals will be deferred until the commencement of the renewal term under the original license agreement currently term license renewals are generally recognized upon execution of the renewal agreement the company is in the process of quantifying the impact of the issues identified above as well as finalizing its accounting positions on other areas where the impact is not expected to be significant 

  

       on february 25 2016 the fasb issued asu 201602 “leases topic 842” “asu 201602” under the new guidance lessees will be required to recognize the following for all leases with the exception of leases with a term of twelve months or less at the commencement date a a lease liability which is a lessees obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease measured on a discounted basis and b a rightofuse asset which is an asset that represents the lessee’s right to use or control the use of a specified asset for the lease term under the new guidance lessor accounting is largely unchanged the pronouncement requires a modified retrospective transition approach for leases existing at or entered into after the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements the modified retrospective approach would not require any transition accounting for leases that expire before the earliest comparative period presented a full retrospective transition approach is not permitted public business entities should apply the amendments in asu 201602 for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2018 including interim periods within those fiscal years early adoption is permitted we are currently assessing the impact the adoption of asu 201602 will have on our financial position and results of operations 

on march 30 2016 the fasb issued accounting standards update no 201609 “asu 201609” “compensation  stock compensation topic 718 improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting” the amendments are intended to simplify and improve the accounting for employee sharebased payments under the new guidance all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies overunder compensation expense recognized will be reflected in the income statement as they occur this will replace the current guidance which requires tax benefits that exceed compensation expense windfalls to be recognized in equity it will also eliminate the need to maintain a “windfall pool” and will remove the requirement to delay recognizing a windfall until it reduces current taxes payable the new guidance will also change the cash flow presentation of excess tax benefits classifying them as operating inflows consistent with other cash flows related to income taxes under current guidance windfalls are classified as financing activities these changes may result in more volatile net earnings similarly effective tax rates will be subject to more variability since the new guidance reflects all tax benefit excesses and deficiencies in tax expense under current practice stock compensation generally does not impact the effective tax rate since any difference between compensation expense and the ultimate tax deduction is reflected in additional paid in capital also under the new guidance excess tax benefits will no longer be included in assumed proceeds from applying the treasury stock method when computing diluted earnings per share since they will no longer be recognized in additional paid in capital consequently the reduction to common stock equivalents for assumed purchases from proceeds will be lower and the impact of common stock equivalents will be more dilutive for public companies the amendments are effective for annual periods 

 43 

beginning after december 15 2016 and interim periods within those annual periods early adoption is permitted for any organization in any interim or annual period    we expect to adopt the asu in january 2017 during 2016 2015 and 2014 we recorded 32 million 29 million and 40 million respectively to consolidated equity as excess tax benefits from our stock plans 

    

on june 16 2016 the fasb issued accounting standards update no 201613 “asu 201613” “financial instrument  credit losses topic 326 measurements on credit losses of financial instruments” these amendments primary objectives are to implement new methodology for calculating credit losses on financial instruments eg trade receivables based on expected credit losses and broadens the types of information companies must use when calculating the estimated losses under current guidance the credit losses are calculated based on multiple credit impairment objectives and recognition is delayed until the loss is probable to occur under the new guidance financial assets measured at amortized cost basis must now be shown as the net amount expected to be collected the credit loss allowance is a contravaluation account availableforsale securities should continue to be recognized in a similar manner to current gaap however the allowance should be presented as an allowance instead of a writedown of the basis of the asset for public companies that are sec filers the amendments are effective for annual periods beginning after december 15 2019 and interim periods within those annual periods early adoption is permitted for any organization in any interim or annual period beginning after december 15 2018 we do not plan to early adopt and expect that the new guidance will not have a material impact on our financial statement presentation financial position or results of operations 

on august 26 2016 the fasb issued accounting standards update no 201615 “asu 201615 “statement of cash flows topic 230 classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments” the amendments are meant to reduce the diversity in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented in the statement of cash flows asu 201615 provides guidance as to the presentation on the statement of cash flows for eight specific cash flow issues which are 1 debt prepayment for debt extinguishment costs 2 settlement of zerocoupon debt instruments or other debt instruments with coupon interest rates that are insignificant in relation to the effective interest rate of the borrowing 3 contingent consideration payments made after a business combination 4 proceeds for the settlement of insurance claims 5 proceeds from the settlement of corporateowned life insurance policies including bankowned life insurance policies 6 distributions received from equity method investees 7 beneficial interests in securitization transactions and 8 separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle for public companies the amendments are effective for annual periods beginning after december 15 2018 and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after december 15 2019 early adoption is permitted for any organization in any interim or annual period we do not plan to early adopt and expect that the new guidance will not have a material impact on our financial statement presentation

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risks 

tableend 

  market risk 

we are exposed to market risks primarily from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates we use certain derivative financial instruments including interest rate swaps and foreign currency forward contracts to manage interest rate and foreign currency risk we do not use derivatives for trading purposes to generate income or to engage in speculative activity 

interest rate risk 

in addition to existing cash balances and cash provided by operating activities we use fixed rate and variable rate debt to finance our operations we are exposed to interest rate risk on these debt obligations and related interest rate swaps 

the senior notes as described in note 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements represent substantially all of our fixedrate longterm debt obligations as of december 31 2016 the carrying value of the notes was 9950 million  as of december 31 2016  the fair value of the senior notes was approximately 10133 million  as of december 31 2016  the potential reduction in fair value of the senior notes from a hypothetical 10  percent increase in market interest rates would not be material to the overall fair value of the debt 

our floating rate longterm debt obligations principally relate to borrowings under the fis credit agreements as defined in note 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements an increase of 100 basis points in the libor rate would increase our annual debt service under the fis credit agreements after we include the impact of our interest rate swaps by 1 million  based on principal amounts outstanding as of december 31 2016  we performed the foregoing sensitivity analysis based on the principal amount of our floating rate debt as of december 31 2016  less the principal amount of such debt that was then subject to an interest rate swap converting such debt into fixed rate debt this sensitivity analysis is based solely on 

 44 

the principal amount of such debt as of december 31 2016  and does not take into account any changes that occurred in the prior 12 months or that may take place in the next 12 months in the amount of our outstanding debt or in the notional amount of outstanding interest rate swaps in respect of our debt further in this sensitivity analysis the change in interest rates is assumed to be applicable for an entire year for comparison purposes based on principal amounts of floating rate debt outstanding as of december 31 2015  and calculated in the same manner as set forth above an increase of 100 basis points in the libor rate would have increased our annual interest expense after we calculate the impact of our interest rate swaps by 23 million  

we use interest rate swaps for the purpose of managing our interest expense through the mix of fixed rate and floating rate debt as of december 31 2016  we have entered into the following interest rate swap transaction converting a portion of the interest rate exposure on our term and revolving loans from variable to fixed in millions 



 

 we have designated the interest rate swap as a cash flow hedge for accounting purposes a portion of the amount included in accumulated other comprehensive earnings is reclassified into interest expense as a yield adjustment as interest payments are made on the term and revolving loans in accordance with the authoritative guidance for fair value measurements the inputs used to determine the estimated fair value of our interest rate swap are level 2type measurements we considered our own credit risk and the credit risk of the counterparties when determining the fair value of our interest rate swap 

       in september 2015 the company entered into treasury lock hedges with a total notional amount of 10 billion  reducing the risk of changes in the benchmark index component of the 10year treasury yield the company designated these derivatives as cash flow hedges on october 13 2015 in conjunction with the pricing of the 45 billion  senior notes the company terminated these treasury lock contracts for a cash settlement payment of 16 million  which was recorded as a component of other comprehensive earnings and will be reclassified as an adjustment to interest expense over the ten  years during which the related interest payments that were hedged will be recognized in income 

foreign currency risk 

we are exposed to foreign currency risks that arise from normal business operations these risks include the translation of local currency balances of foreign subsidiaries transaction gains and losses associated with intercompany loans with foreign subsidiaries and transactions denominated in currencies other than a locations functional currency we manage the exposure to these risks through a combination of normal operating activities and the use of foreign currency forward contracts contracts are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries 

our exposure to foreign currency exchange risks generally arises from our nonus operations to the extent they are conducted in local currency changes in foreign currency exchange rates affect translations of revenues denominated in currencies other than the us dollar during the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  we generated approximately 1909 million  1336 million  and 1229 million  respectively in revenues denominated in currencies other than the us dollar the major currencies to which our revenues are exposed are the brazilian real the euro the british pound sterling and the indian rupee a 10 move in average exchange rates for these currencies assuming a simultaneous and immediate 10 change in all of such rates for the relevant period would have resulted in the following increase or decrease in our reported revenues for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  in millions 



 45 

while our results of operations have been impacted by the effects of currency fluctuations our international operations revenues and expenses are generally denominated in local currency which reduces our economic exposure to foreign exchange risk in those jurisdictions 

  

revenues included 100 million  and 243 million  and net earnings included 10 million  and 31 million  respectively of unfavorable foreign currency impact during 2016  and 2015  resulting from a stronger us dollar during these years compared to the preceding year in 2017 we expect continued unfavorable foreign currency impact on our operating income resulting from the continued strengthening of the us dollar vs other currencies 

our foreign exchange risk management policy permits the use of derivative instruments such as forward contracts and options to reduce volatility in our results of operations andor cash flows resulting from foreign exchange rate fluctuations we do not enter into foreign currency derivative instruments for trading purposes or to engage in speculative activity we do periodically enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency exposure to intercompany loans as of december 31 2016  the notional amount of these derivatives was approximately 143 million  and the fair value was nominal these derivatives are intended to hedge the foreign exchange risks related to intercompany loans but have not been designated as hedges for accounting purposes 

       we also use currency forward contracts to manage our exposure to fluctuations in costs caused by variations in indian rupee inr exchange rates as of december 31 2016  the notional amount of these derivatives was approximately 7 million  and the fair value was less than 1 million  these inr forward contracts are designated as cash flow hedges the fair value of these currency forward contracts is determined using currency exchange market rates obtained from reliable independent third party banks at the balance sheet date the fair value of forward contracts is subject to changes in currency exchange rates the company has no ineffectiveness related to its use of currency forward contracts in connection with inr cash flow hedges 

in conjunction with entering into the definitive agreement to acquire clear2pay in september 2014 we initiated a foreign currency forward contract to purchase euros and sell us dollars to manage the risk arising from fluctuations in exchange rates until the closing because the purchase price was stated in euros as this derivative did not qualify for hedge accounting we recorded a charge of 16 million  in other income expense net during the third quarter of 2014 this forward contract was settled on october 1 2014

our global marketing strategy is to develop and lead the execution of the ifs and gfs strategic marketing plans in support of their revenue and profitability goals and the fis brand key components include thought leadership integrated programs with consistent message development internal and external communications client conference content management web content creation and management trade shows demand generation campaigns and collateral development and management 

patents copyrights trademarks and other intellectual property 

the company owns intellectual property including trademarks trade names copyrights and patents which we believe is important to our future success although we acquired the trademarks and trade names used by sungard we note that following the splitoff of the availability services “as” business by sungard in 2014 as has the right to use the sungard availability services name which does not include the right to use the sungard name or its derivatives 

 7 

we rely on a combination of contractual restrictions internal security practices patents copyrights and applicable law to establish and protect our software technology and expertise worldwide we rely on trademark law to protect our rights in our brands we intend to continue taking appropriate measures to protect our intellectual property rights including by legal action when necessary and appropriate in general we own the proprietary rights necessary for the conduct of our business although we do license certain items from third parties under armslength agreements for varying terms including some open source licenses 

competition 

the markets for our solutions and services are intensely competitive depending on the business line in both our ifs and gfs segments our primary competitors include internal technology departments within financial institutions and retailers data processing or software development departments of large companies or large computer manufacturers and companies that deliver software and integrated services to the financial services industry thirdparty payment processors securities exchanges asset managers card associations clearing networks or associations trust companies independent computer services firms companies that develop and deploy software applications companies that provide customized development implementation and support services strategic consulting and technology consulting firms and business process outsourcing companies many of these companies compete with us across multiple solutions markets and geographies some of these competitors possess greater financial sales and marketing resources than we do competitive factors impacting the success of our services across our segments include the quality of the technologybased application or service application features and functions ease of delivery and integration the ability of the provider to maintain enhance and support the applications or services price and overall relationship management we believe we compete favorably in each of these categories in addition we believe our financial services industry expertise combined with our ability to offer multiple applications services and integrated solutions to individual clients enhances our competitiveness against companies with more limited offerings 

research and development 

our research and development activities have related primarily to the design and development of processing systems and related software applications and risk management platforms we expect to continue our practice of investing an appropriate level of resources to maintain enhance and extend the functionality of our proprietary systems and existing software applications to develop new and innovative software applications and systems to address emerging technology trends in response to the needs of our clients and to enhance the capabilities surrounding our outsourcing infrastructure in addition we intend to offer services compatible with new and emerging delivery channels 

as part of our research and development process we evaluate current and emerging technology for compatibility with our existing and future software platforms to this end we engage with various hardware and software vendors in evaluation of various infrastructure components where appropriate we use thirdparty technology components in the development of our software applications and service offerings in the case of nearly all of our thirdparty software enterprise license agreements exist for the thirdparty component and either alternative suppliers exist or transfer rights exist to ensure the continuity of supply as a result we are not materially dependent upon any thirdparty technology components thirdparty software may be used for highly specialized business functions which we may not be able to develop internally within time and budget constraints additionally thirdparty software may be used for commoditytype functions within a technology platform environment we work with our clients to determine the appropriate timing and approach to introducing technology or infrastructure changes to our applications and services in each of the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  approximately 2 to 3 of revenues were invested in research and development efforts sungard historically invested a higher percentage of its revenues in research and development and that trend is expected to continue which will result in a higher overall consolidated ratio as well 

government regulation 

our services are subject to a broad range of complex federal state and foreign regulation and requirements as well as requirements under the rules of selfregulatory organizations including federal truthinlending and truthinsavings rules regulation aa unfair or deceptive acts or practices privacy laws usury laws laws governing state trust charters the equal credit opportunity act the electronic funds transfer act the fair credit reporting act the fair debt collection practices act the bank secrecy act the usa patriot act the internal revenue code the employee retirement income security act the health insurance portability and accountability act the community reinvestment act and the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the doddfrank act the securities exchange act of 1934 the 1934 act the investment advisors act of 1940 the 1940 act the us foreign corrupt practices act and the rules and regulations of the financial

globally attacks on information technology systems continue to grow in frequency complexity and sophistication such attacks have become a point of focus for individuals businesses and governmental entities the objectives of these attacks include among other things gaining unauthorized access to systems to facilitate financial fraud disrupt operations cause denial of service events corrupt data and steal nonpublic sensitive information these circumstances present both a threat and an opportunity for fis as part of our business we electronically receive process store and transmit a wide range of confidential information including sensitive customer information and personal consumer data we also operate payment cash access and prepaid card systems 

fis remains focused on making strategic investments in information security to protect our clients and our information systems this includes both capital expenditures and operating expenses on hardware software personnel and consulting services we also participate in industry and governmental initiatives to improve information security for our clients through the expertise we have gained with this ongoing focus and involvement we have developed fraud security risk management and compliance solutions to target this growth opportunity in the financial services industry

risk factors 

tableend 

in addition to the normal risks of business we are subject to significant risks and uncertainties including those listed below and others described elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k any of the risks described herein could result in a significant adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

risks related to our business and operations 

entity mergers or consolidations and business failures in the banking and financial services industry could adversely affect our business by eliminating some of our existing and potential clients and making us more dependent on a more limited number of clients 

there has been and continues to be substantial consolidation activity in the banking and financial services industry in addition many financial institutions that experienced negative operating results including some of our clients have failed these consolidations and failures reduce our number of potential clients and may reduce our number of existing clients which could adversely affect our revenues even if the events do not reduce the aggregate activities of the consolidated entities further if our clients fail andor merge with or are acquired by other entities that are not our clients or that use fewer of our services they may discontinue or reduce use of our services it is also possible that larger financial institutions resulting from consolidations would have greater leverage in negotiating terms or could decide to perform inhouse some or all of the services we currently provide or could provide any of these developments could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

if we fail to innovate or adapt our services to changes in technology or in the marketplace or if our ongoing efforts to upgrade our technology are not successful we could lose clients or our clients could lose customers and have difficulty attracting new clients for our services 

the markets for our services are characterized by constant technological changes frequent introductions of new services and evolving industry standards our future success will be significantly affected by our ability to enhance our current services and develop and introduce new services that address the increasingly sophisticated needs of our clients and their customers in 

addition as more of our revenue shifts to saas cloud bpaas and services the need to keep pace with rapid technology changes becomes more acute these initiatives carry the risks associated with any new service development effort including cost overruns delays in delivery and performance issues there can be no assurance that we will be successful in developing marketing and selling new services that meet these changing demands that we will not experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development introduction and marketing of these services or that our new services and their enhancements will adequately meet the demands of the marketplace and achieve market acceptance any of these developments could have an adverse impact on our future revenues andor business prospects 

we operate in a competitive business environment and if we are unable to compete effectively our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 

the market for our services is intensely competitive our competitors vary in size and in the scope and breadth of the services they offer some of our competitors have substantial resources we face direct competition from third parties and since many of our larger potential clients have historically developed their key applications inhouse and therefore view their system requirements from a makeversusbuy perspective we often compete against our potential clients’ inhouse capacities in addition we expect that the markets in which we compete will continue to attract new competitors and new technologies there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors or that the competitive pressures we face in the markets in which we operate will not materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations see item i business competition  

global economic political and other conditions including business cycles and consumer confidence may adversely affect our clients or trends in consumer spending which may adversely impact the demand for our services and our revenue and profitability 

a significant portion of our revenue is derived from transaction processing fees the global transaction processing industries depend heavily upon the overall level of consumer business and government spending any change in economic factors including a sustained deterioration in general economic conditions or consumer confidence particularly in the united states or increases in interest rates in key countries in which we operate may adversely affect consumer spending including related consumer debt reduce check writing and change credit and debit card usage and as a result adversely affect our financial performance by reducing the number or average purchase amount of transactions that we service 

 12 

when there is a slowdown or downturn in the economy a drop in stock market levels or trading volumes or an event that disrupts the financial markets our business and financial results particularly with respect to our capital markets businesses may suffer for a number of reasons customers may react to worsening conditions by reducing their capital expenditures in general or by specifically reducing their information technology spending in addition customers may curtail or discontinue trading operations delay or cancel information technology projects or seek to lower their costs by renegotiating vendor contracts moreover competitors may respond to market conditions by lowering prices and attempting to lure away our customers to lower cost solutions if any of these circumstances remain in effect for an extended period of time there could be a material adverse effect on our financial results 

constraints within global financial markets or international regulatory requirements could constrain our financial institution clients ability to purchase our services impacting our future growth and profitability 

a significant number of our clients and potential clients may hold sovereign debt of economically struggling nations or be subject to emerging international requirements such as basel iii which could require changes in their capitalization and hence the amount of their working capital available to purchase our services these potential constraints could alter the ability of clients or potential clients to purchase our services and thus could have a significant impact on our future growth and profitability 

potential clients may be reluctant to switch to a new vendor which may adversely affect our growth 

for banks and other potential clients of our financial information software and services switching from one vendor of bank core processing or related software and services or from an internallydeveloped system to a new vendor is a significant undertaking many potential clients perceive potential disadvantages such as loss of accustomed functionality increased costs including conversion costs and business disruption as a result potential clients may resist change we seek to overcome this resistance through value enhancing strategies such as a defined conversion process system integration including bundling additional services and making ongoing investments to enhance the functionality of our software however there can be no assurance that our strategies for overcoming potential clients’ reluctance to change vendors will be successful and this resistance may adversely affect our growth 

the sales and implementation cycles for many of our software and service offerings can be lengthy and require significant investment from both our clients and fis if we fail to close sales or if a client chooses not to complete an installation after expending significant time and resources to do so our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 

the sales and associated deployment of many of our software or service offerings often involve significant capital commitments by our clients andor fis potential clients generally commit significant resources to an evaluation of available software and services and require us to expend substantial time effort and money educating them prior to sales further as part of the sale or deployment of our software and services clients may also require fis to perform significant related services to complete a proof of concept or custom development to meet their needs all of the aforementioned activities may expend significant funds and management resources and ultimately the client may determine not to close the sale or complete the implementation if we are unsuccessful in closing sales or if the client decides not to complete an implementation after we expend significant funds and management resources or we experience delays it could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our results may fluctuate from period to period because of the lengthy and unpredictable sales cycle for our software changes in our mix of licenses and services activity by competitors and customer budgeting or operations requirements or renewal cycles 

particularly with respect to the legacy sungard business our operating results may fluctuate from period to period and be difficult to predict in a particular period due to the timing and magnitude of software license sales and other factors we offer a number of our software solutions on a license basis which means that the customer has the right to run the software on its own computers the customer usually makes a significant upfront payment to license software which we generally recognize as revenue when the license contract is signed and the software is delivered the size of the upfront payment often depends on a number of factors that are different for each customer such as the number of customer locations users or accounts the sales cycle for a software license may be lengthy and take unexpected turns further our customers’ business models are shifting away from paying upfront license fees to paying periodic rental fees for services thus it is difficult to predict when software sales will occur or how much revenue they will generate since there are few incremental costs associated with software sales our operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year due to the timing and magnitude of software sales 

 13 

our results may also vary as a result of pricing pressures increased cost of equipment the evolving and unpredictable markets in which our solutions and services are sold changes in accounting principles and competitors’ new solutions or services 

in addition there are a number of other factors that could cause our sales and results of operation to fluctuate from period to period including 

  

 

failure to obtain new clients or renew client contracts on favorable terms could adversely affect results of operations and financial condition 

we may face pricing pressure in obtaining and retaining our larger clients larger clients may be able to seek price reductions from us when they renew a contract when a contract is extended or when the clients business has significant volume changes they may also reduce services if they decide to move services inhouse further our smaller and midsize clients may exert pricing pressure due to pricing competition or other economic needs or pressures being experienced by the client on some occasions this pricing pressure results in lower revenue from a client than we had anticipated based on our previous agreement with that client this reduction in revenue could result in an adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

further failure to renew client contracts on favorable terms could have an adverse effect on our business our contracts with clients generally run for several years and include liquidated damage provisions that provide for early termination fees terms are generally renegotiated prior to the end of a contracts term if we are not successful in achieving a high rate of contract renewals on favorable terms our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

our business and operating results could be adversely affected if we experience business interruptions errors or failure in connection with our or thirdparty information technology and communication systems and other software and hardware used in connection with its business if we experience defects or design errors in the software solutions we offer or more generally if the thirdparty vendors we rely upon are unwilling or unable to provide the services we need to effectively operate our business 

many of our services including our transformation services are based on sophisticated software and computing systems and we may encounter delays when developing new technology solutions and services further the technology solutions underlying our services have occasionally contained and may in the future contain undetected errors or defects when first introduced or when new versions are released in addition we may experience difficulties in installing or integrating our technologies on platforms used by our clients or our clients may cancel a project after we have expended significant effort and resources to complete an installation finally our systems and operations could be exposed to damage or interruption from fire natural disaster power loss telecommunications failure unauthorized entry and computer viruses defects in our technology solutions errors or delays in the processing of electronic transactions or other difficulties could result in i interruption of business operations ii delay in market acceptance iii additional development and remediation costs iv diversion of technical and other resources v loss of clients vi negative publicity or vii exposure to liability claims any one or more of the foregoing could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations although we attempt to limit our potential liability through controls including system redundancies security controls application development and testing controls and disclaimers and limitationofliability provisions in our license and client agreements we cannot be certain that these measures will always be successful in preventing disruption or limiting our liability 

further most of the solutions we offer are very complex software systems that are regularly updated no matter how careful the design and development complex software often contains errors and defects when first introduced and when major new updates or enhancements are released if errors or defects are discovered in current or future solutions we may not be able to correct them in a timely manner if at all in our development of updates and enhancements to our software solutions we may make a major design error that makes the solution operate incorrectly or less efficiently the failure of software to properly perform could result in the company and its clients being subjected to losses or liability including censures fines or other 

 14 

sanctions by applicable regulatory authorities and we could be liable to parties who are financially harmed by those errors in addition such errors could cause the company to lose revenues lose clients or damage its reputation 

for approximately one week in august 2015 certain us operations of a single sungard customer were disrupted by an issue affecting its sungardhosted fund accounting platform that occurred following a recommended operating system update implemented by sungard the customer uses the platform for the processing of net asset values navs for certain mutual funds exchangetraded funds and collective investment funds while the incident resulted in delayed publication of certain navs or use of alternative navs no data was lost as a result of the incident the platform is operating as designed and we continue to work with our customer to resolve all resulting matters no other legacy sungard customers were disrupted 

in addition we generally depend on a number of third parties both in the united states and internationally to supply elements of our systems computers research and market data connectivity communication network infrastructure other equipment and related support and maintenance we cannot be certain that any of these third parties will be able to continue providing these services to effectively meet our evolving needs if our vendors or in certain cases vendors of our customers fail to meet their obligations provide poor or untimely service or we are unable to make alternative arrangements for the provision of these services we may in turn fail to provide our services or to meet our obligations to our customers and our business financial condition and operating results could be materially harmed 

  

the doddfrank act may result in business changes for our clients that could have an adverse effect on our financial condition revenues results of operations or prospects for future growth and overall business  

our clients are required to comply with numerous regulations the doddfrank act and associated durbin amendment were passed and signed into law in 2010 the doddfrank act represents a comprehensive overhaul of the regulations governing the financial services industry within the united states the doddfrank act established the cfpb and will require this and other federal agencies to implement many new regulations which have the potential to increase the amount and types of regulation on areas of our business that were not previously regulated 

several new regulations and rules will be written and implemented as directed by the doddfrank act these new rules and regulations will require our clients or potential clients to comply with new requirements and could require us to directly comply with new regulations these new requirements could result in the need for fis to make capital investments to modify our solutions and services to facilitate our clients and potential clients compliance as well as to deploy additional processes or reporting to comply with new regulations further requirements of the new regulations could result in changes in our clients business practices and those of other marketplace participants that may alter the delivery of services to consumers which could impact the demand for our software and services as well as alter the type or volume of transactions that we process on behalf of our clients as a result these new requirements could have an adverse impact on our financial condition revenues results of operations prospects for future growth and overall business 

many of our clients are subject to a regulatory environment and to industry standards that may change in a manner that reduces the types or volume of solutions or services we provide or may reduce the type or number of transactions in which our clients engage and therefore reduces our revenues 

our clients are subject to a number of government regulations and industry standards with which our services must comply our clients must ensure that our services and related solutions work within the extensive and evolving regulatory and industry requirements applicable to them federal state foreign or industry authorities could adopt laws rules or regulations affecting our clients businesses that could lead to increased operating costs and could reduce the convenience and functionality of our services possibly resulting in reduced market acceptance in addition action by regulatory authorities relating to credit availability data usage privacy or other related regulatory developments could have an adverse effect on our clients and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition revenues results of operations prospects for future growth and overall business 

regulations enacted by the cfpb may require fis to adopt new business practices which may require capital investment andor incremental expenses which could impact our future operating results 

the cfpb regulates financial and nonfinancial institutions and providers to those institutions the cfpb is establishing its regulatory agenda and will likely pass additional rules for regulating nonfinancial institution providers to ensure adequate protection of consumer privacy and to ensure consumers are not impacted by deceptive business practices the impact of these rules may require fis to be subject to additional regulation and adopt additional business practices that could require additional capital expenditures or impact our operating results 

 15 

our revenues from the sale of services to members of visa mastercard american express discover and other similar organizations are dependent upon our continued certification and sponsorship and the loss or suspension of certification or sponsorship could adversely affect our business 

in order to provide our card processing services we must be certified including applicable sponsorship by visa mastercard american express discover and other similar organizations these certifications are dependent upon our continued adherence to the standards of the issuing bodies and sponsoring member banks the member financial institutions some of which are our competitors set the standards with which we must comply if we fail to comply with these standards we could be fined our certifications could be suspended or our registration could be terminated the suspension or termination of our certifications or any changes in the rules and regulations governing visa mastercard american express discover or other similar organizations could result in a reduction in revenue or increased costs of operation which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business 

changes in card association and debit network fees or products could increase costs or otherwise limit our operations 

from time to time card associations and debit networks increase the interchange fees that they charge it is possible that competitive pressures will result in our absorption of a portion of such increases in the future which would increase our operating costs reduce our profit margin and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations furthermore the rules and regulations of the various card associations and networks prescribe certain capital requirements any increase in the capital level required would further limit our use of capital for other purposes 

interchange fees and related practices have been receiving significant legal and regulatory scrutiny worldwide the resulting regulatory changes that could occur from proposed regulations could alter the fees charged by card associations and debit networks worldwide such changes could have an adverse impact on our business or financial condition due to reductions or changes in types of transactions processed on behalf of our clients 

our securities brokerage operations are highly regulated and subject to risks that are not encountered in our other businesses 

one of our subsidiaries is an sec registered brokerdealer in the us and others are authorized by the fca to conduct certain regulated business in the uk domestic and foreign regulatory and selfregulatory organizations such as the sec the financial industry regulatory authority and the fca can among other things fine censure issue ceaseanddesist orders against and suspend or expel a brokerdealer or its officers or employees for failure to comply with the many laws and regulations that govern brokerage activities such sanctions may arise out of currentlyconducted activities or those conducted in prior periods our ability to comply with these laws and regulations is largely dependent on our establishment maintenance and enforcement of an effective brokerage compliance program failure to establish maintain and enforce the required brokerage compliance procedures even if unintentional could subject us to significant losses lead to disciplinary or other actions and tarnish our reputation regulations affecting the brokerage industry may change which could adversely affect our financial results 

we are exposed to certain risks relating to the execution services provided by our brokerage operations to our customers and counterparties which include other brokerdealers active traders hedge funds asset managers and other institutional and noninstitutional clients these risks include but are not limited to customers or counterparties failing to pay for or deliver securities trading errors the inability or failure to settle trades and trade execution system failures in our other businesses we generally can disclaim liability for trading losses that may be caused by our software but in our brokerage operations we may not be able to limit our liability for trading losses or failed trades even when we are not at fault as a result we may suffer losses that are disproportionately large compared to the relatively modest profit contributions of our brokerage operations 

if we fail to comply with applicable regulations or to meet regulatory expectations our business results of operations or financial condition could be adversely impacted 

the majority of our data processing services for financial institutions are not directly subject to federal or state regulations specifically applicable to financial institutions such as banks thrifts and credit unions however as a provider of services to these financial institutions our data processing operations are examined on a regular basis by various federal and state regulatory authorities and by international regulatory authorities such as the fca in certain jurisdictions if we fail to comply with any applicable regulations or guidelines for operations of a data services provider we could be subject to regulatory actions or rating changes may not meet contractual obligations and may suffer harm to our client relationships or reputation failure to meet the aforementioned requirements or to adapt to new requirements at the federal state or international level 

 16 

could inhibit our ability to retain existing clients or obtain new clients which could have an adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition 

in addition to our data processing services described above we also have business operations that store process or transmit consumer information or have direct relationships with consumers that are obligated to comply with regulations including but not limited to the federal fair credit reporting act the federal fair debt collection practices act and applicable privacy requirements further our international businesses must comply with applicable laws such as the us foreign corrupt practices act failure to maintain compliance with or adapt to changes in any of the aforementioned requirements could result in fines penalties or regulatory actions that could have an adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition 

security breaches or attacks or our failure to comply with information security laws or regulations or industry security requirements could harm our business by disrupting our delivery of services and damaging our reputation and could result in a breach of one or more client contracts 

we electronically receive process store and transmit sensitive business information of our clients in addition we collect personal consumer data such as names and addresses social security numbers drivers license numbers cardholder data and payment history records such information is necessary to support our clients’ transaction processing and to conduct our check authorization and collection businesses the uninterrupted operation of our information systems as well as the confidentiality of the customerconsumer information that resides on such systems is critical to our successful operation if we fail to maintain an adequate security infrastructure adapt to emerging security threats or implement sufficient security standards and technology to protect against security breaches the confidentiality of the information we secure could be compromised unauthorized access to our computer systems or databases could result in the theft or publication of confidential information the deletion or modification of records or could otherwise cause interruptions in our operations these risks are greater with increased information transmission over the internet and the increasing level of sophistication posed by cyber criminals 

as a provider of services to financial institutions and a provider of card processing services we are bound by the same limitations on disclosure of the information we receive from our clients as apply to the clients themselves if we fail to comply with these regulations and industry security requirements we could be exposed to suits for breach of contract governmental proceedings and the imposition of fines or prohibitions on card processing services in addition if more restrictive privacy laws rules or industry security requirements are adopted in the future on the federal or state level or by a specific industry body they could have an adverse impact on us through increased costs or restrictions on business processes any inability to prevent security or privacy breaches or the perception that such breaches may occur could cause our existing clients to lose confidence in our systems and terminate their agreements with us inhibit our ability to attract new clients result in increasing regulation or bring about other adverse consequences from the government agencies that regulate our business 

high profile payment card industry or digital banking security breaches could impact consumer payment behavior patterns in the future and reduce our card payment transaction volumes 

  we are unable to predict whether or when high profile card payment or digital banking security breaches will occur and if they occur whether consumers will transact less on their payment cards or reduce their digital banking service if consumers transact less on cards issued by our clients or reduce digital banking services and we are not able to adapt to offer our clients alternative technologies it could have a significant adverse impact on our revenue and related earnings 

misappropriation of our intellectual property and proprietary rights or a finding that our patents are invalid could impair our competitive position 

our ability to compete depends in some part upon our proprietary solutions and technology despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our services or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary or challenge the validity of our patents with governmental authorities policing unauthorized use of our proprietary rights is difficult we cannot make any assurances that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of technology or that the agreements entered into for that purpose will be enforceable effective patent trademark service mark copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our applications and services are made available online misappropriation of our intellectual property or potential litigation concerning such matters could have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 

if our applications or services are found to infringe the proprietary rights of others we may be required to change our business practices and may also become subject to significant costs and monetary penalties 

 17 

as our information technology applications and services develop we are increasingly subject to infringement claims any claims whether with or without merit could i be expensive and timeconsuming to defend ii result in an injunction or other equitable relief which could cause us to cease making licensing or using applications that incorporate the challenged intellectual property iii require us to redesign our applications if feasible iv divert management’s attention and resources and v require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements in order to obtain the right to use necessary technologies or pay damages resulting from any infringing use 

some of our solutions contain “open source” software and any failure to comply with the terms of one or more of these open source licenses could negatively affect our business 

we use a limited amount of software licensed by its authors or other third parties under socalled “open source” licenses and may continue to use such software in the future some of these licenses contain requirements that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the open source software and that we license such modifications or derivative works under the terms of a particular open source license or other license granting third parties certain rights of further use by the terms of certain open source licenses we could be required to release the source code of our proprietary software if we combine our proprietary software with open source software in a certain manner additionally the terms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by united states or other courts and there is a risk that these licenses could be construed in a manner that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our solutions in addition to risks related to license requirements usage of open source software can lead to greater risks than use of thirdparty commercial software as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on origin of the software we have established processes to help alleviate these risks including a review process for screening requests from our development organizations for the use of open source but we cannot be sure that all open source is submitted for approval prior to use in our solutions in addition many of the risks associated with usage of open source cannot be eliminated and could if not properly addressed negatively affect our business 

we face liability to our merchant clients if checks that we have guaranteed are dishonored by the check writer’s bank 

if checks that we have guaranteed are dishonored by the check writers banks we must reimburse our merchant clients for the checks face value and pursue collection from the check writers in some cases we recognize a liability to our merchant clients for estimated check returns and a receivable for amounts we estimate we will recover from the check writers based on historical experience and other relevant factors the estimated check returns and recovery amounts are subject to the risk that actual amounts returned may exceed our estimates and actual amounts recovered by us may be less than our estimates changes in economic conditions the risk characteristics and composition of our clients and other factors could impact our actual and projected amounts 

lack of system integrity fraudulent payments credit quality and undetected errors related to funds settlement or the availability of clearing services could result in a financial loss 

we settle funds on behalf of financial institutions other businesses and consumers and receive funds from clients card issuers payment networks and consumers on a daily basis for a variety of transaction types transactions facilitated by us include debit card credit card electronic bill payment transactions banking payments and check clearing that supports consumers financial institutions and other businesses these payment activities rely upon the technology infrastructure that facilitates the verification of activity with counterparties the facilitation of the payment as well as the detection or prevention of fraudulent payments if our continuity of operations integrity of processing or ability to detect or prevent fraudulent payments were compromised this could result in a financial loss to us in addition we rely on various financial institutions to provide ach services in support of funds settlement for certain of our solutions if we are unable to obtain such ach services in the future that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations in addition we may issue credit to consumers financial institutions or other businesses as part of the funds settlement a default on this credit by a counterparty could result in a financial loss to us furthermore if one of our clients for which we facilitate settlement suffers a fraudulent event due to an error of their controls we may suffer a financial loss if the client does not have sufficient capital to cover the loss 

failure to properly manage or mitigate risks in the operation of our wealth management businesses in the us and the uk could have adverse liability consequences 

 we have wealth management businesses in the us and uk engaged in processing securities transactions on behalf of clients and serving as a custodian failure to properly manage or mitigate risks in those operations and increased volatility in the financial markets may increase the potential for and magnitude of resulting losses including those that may arise from human errors or omissions defects or interruptions in computer or communications systems or breakdowns in processes or in 

 18 

internal controls human errors or omissions may include failures to comply with applicable laws or corporate policies and procedures theft fraud or misappropriation of assets whether arising from the intentional actions of internal personnel or external third parties     in addition the usbased business holds charters in the states of georgia and delaware which exposes us to further regulatory compliance requirements of the georgia department of banking and finance and the office of the commissioner of banking in the state of delaware the us wealth management business is required to hold certain levels of regulatory capital as defined by the state banking regulators in the states in which they hold a bank or trust charter delaware and georgia in the uk our platform securities and broker dealer businesses are regulated by the fca and are subject to further regulatory capital requirements we also have registered investment advisor and transfer agent businesses regulated by the sec and subject to further regulatory requirements 

our business is subject to the risks of international operations including movements in foreign currency exchange rates 

the international operations of fis represented approximately 22 of our total 2015 revenues and are largely conducted in currencies other than the us dollar including the brazilian real british pound euro and indian rupee fis completed the sungard acquisition on november 30 2015 and sungards revenues are included after the date of acquisition sungard legacy businesses derive an even greater percentage of total revenues outside the united states primarily from customers located in europe over the past few years sungard has expanded its operations in certain emerging markets in asia africa europe the middle east and south america as a result following the acquisition we are to a greater degree subject to risks associated with doing business internationally our business and financial results could be adversely affected due to a variety of factors including 

 • unexpected or unfavorable changes in foreign laws regulatory requirements and related interpretations 

• difficulty of effective enforcement of contractual provisions in local jurisdictions 

• inadequate intellectual property protection in foreign countries 

 control regulations particularly in emerging markets 

in foreign countries particularly in those with developing economies certain business practices may exist that are prohibited by laws and regulations applicable to us such as the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and other anticorruption laws although our policies and procedures require compliance with these laws and are designed to facilitate compliance with these laws our employees contractors and agents may take actions in violation of applicable laws or our policies any such violation even if prohibited by our policies could have a material adverse effect on our business and 

reputation 

as we expand our international operations more of our clients may pay us in foreign currencies conducting business in currencies other than us dollars subjects us to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that can negatively impact our results period to period including relative to analyst estimates or guidance our primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to foreign currencies in brazil europe australia and parts of asia the us dollar value of our net investments in foreign operations the periodic conversion of foreigndenominated earnings to the us dollar our reporting currency and our results of operations and in some cases cash flows could be adversely affected in a material manner by movements in foreign currency exchange rates these risks could cause an adverse effect on the business financial position and results of operations of the company 

we have businesses in emerging markets that may experience significant economic volatility 

 19 

 we have operations in emerging markets primarily in brazil india southeast asia the middle east and africa these emerging market economies tend to be more volatile than the more established markets we serve in north america and europe which could add volatility to our future revenues and earnings 

failure to attract and retain skilled technical employees or senior management personnel could harm our ability to grow 

our future success depends upon our ability to attract and retain highlyskilled technical personnel because the development of our solutions and services requires knowledge of computer hardware operating system software system management software and application software our technical personnel must be proficient in a number of disciplines competition for such technical personnel is intense and our failure to hire and retain talented personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

our future growth will also require sales and marketing financial and administrative personnel to develop and support new solutions and services to enhance and support current solutions and services and to expand operational and financial systems there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain the necessary personnel to accomplish our growth strategies and we may experience constraints that could adversely affect our ability to satisfy client demand in a timely fashion 

our ability to maintain compliance with applicable laws rules and regulations and to manage and monitor the risks facing our business relies upon the ability to maintain skilled compliance security risk and audit professionals competition for such skillsets is intense and our failure to hire and retain talented personnel could have an adverse effect on our internal control environment and impact our operating results 

our senior management team has significant experience in the financial services industry either at fis or with clients or competitors and the loss of this leadership could have an adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition further the loss of this leadership may have an adverse impact on senior managements ability to provide effective oversight and strategic direction for all key functions within the company which could impact our future business operating results and financial condition 

we are the subject of various legal proceedings that could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability 

we are involved in various litigation matters including in some cases classaction and patent infringement litigation if we are unsuccessful in our defense of litigation matters we may be forced to pay damages andor change our business practices any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

 unfavorable resolution of tax contingencies or unfavorable future tax law changes could adversely affect our tax expense 

our tax returns and positions are subject to review and audit by federal state local and international taxing authorities an unfavorable outcome to a tax audit could result in higher tax expense and could negatively impact our effective tax rate financial position results of operations and cash flows in the current andor future periods unfavorable future tax law changes could also result in these negative impacts in addition taxlaw amendments in the united states and other jurisdictions could significantly impact how united states multinational corporations are taxed although we cannot predict whether or in what form such legislation will pass if enacted it could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 

a material weakness in our internal controls could have a material adverse effect on us 

effectiv e  internal controls are necessary for us to provide reasonable assurance with respect to our financial reports and to adequately mitigate risk of fraud if we cannot provide reasonable assurance with respect to our financial reports and adequately mitigate risk of fraud our reputation and operating results could be harmed internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations including the possibility of human error the circumvention or overriding of controls or fraud therefore even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements in addition projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

  

a material weakness is a deficiency or combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting could adversely impact our ability to provide timely and accurate financial information if we are unable to report financial information timely 

 20 

and accurately or to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures we could be subject to among other things regulatory or enforcement actions by the sec any one of which could adversely affect our business prospects 

risks related to business combinations and ventures 

we expect to incur substantial expenses related to the sungard acquisition which was completed on november 30 2015 and the integration of sungard 

we expect to incur substantial expenses in connection with the acquisition and the integration of sungard additionally there are a large number of processes policies procedures operations technologies and systems that must be integrated including information technology purchasing accounting and finance sales billing information security risk legal marketing and human resources including payroll and employee benefits while we have attempted to estimate the aftertax integration and restructuring costs and other costs incurred to execute the transaction following completion of the acquisition many of the expenses that will be incurred are by their nature difficult to estimate accurately these expenses are likely particularly in the near term to exceed the savings that we expect to achieve from elimination of duplicative expenses and the realization of economies of scale and cost savings although we expect that the realization of efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses will offset incremental transaction mergerrelated and restructuring costs over time we cannot give any assurance that this net benefit will be achieved in the near term or at all 

in addition there is a risk that fis will be exposed to liabilities of sungard that were not disclosed to fis in connection with its entry into the merger agreement under the merger agreement fis has no contractual rights to indemnification for any undisclosed liabilities any such losses or liabilities could be material to our results of operations or financial condition 

successful integration of sungard and successful operation of the combined company is not assured and the combined company may not be able to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition  also integration efforts may divert the attention of management away from operations 

realization of the anticipated benefits in the acquisition will depend in part on the combined company’s ability to successfully integrate the businesses and operations of sungard integrating and coordinating certain aspects of the operations and personnel of sungard will involve complex operational technological and personnelrelated challenges this process will be timeconsuming and expensive may disrupt our businesses and may not result in the full benefits we expected including cost synergies expected to arise from overlapping functions the potential difficulties and resulting costs and delays include 

 

additionally the integration of sungard’s operations solutions and personnel may place a significant burden on management and other internal resources the diversion of management’s attention and any difficulties encountered in the transition and integration process could harm the combined company’s business financial condition and operating results if the combined company is not successfully integrated the anticipated benefits of the acquisition  including cost synergies may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected there can be no assurances that the expected benefits and efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses will be realized to offset the integration costs over time 

there could be significant liability for us if all or part of the as splitoff were determined to be taxable for us federal or state income tax purposes 

on march 31 2014 sungard completed the splitoff of its availability services as business to its existing stockholders including its private equity owners on a taxfree and prorata basis the “as splitoff” at the time sungard received opinions from outside tax counsel to the effect that the as splitoff should qualify for taxfree treatment as transactions described in section 355 and related provisions of the internal revenue code as amended the “code” in addition actions taken following the as splitoff including the acquisition and certain 50 percent or greater changes by vote or value of the stock ownership of the new entity conducting the as business may cause the as splitoff to be taxable to fis in connection with the acquisition we and sungard received opinions of outside tax counsel to the effect that the acquisition should not cause the as splitoff to fail to so qualify 

 21 

notwithstanding the receipt of tax opinions the taxfree treatment of the as splitoff is not free from doubt and there is a risk that the internal revenue service the “irs” a state taxing authority or a court could conclude to the contrary that the separation of the as business from sungard may not qualify as taxfree transactions an opinion of tax counsel is not binding on the irs state taxing authorities or any court and as a result there can be no assurance that a tax authority will not challenge the taxfree treatment of all or part of the as splitoff or that if litigated a court would not agree with the irs or a state taxing authority further these tax opinions rely on certain facts assumptions representations warranties and covenants from sungard the new entity conducting the as business and from some of sungard’s stockholders regarding the past and future conduct of the companies’ respective businesses share ownership and other matters if any of the facts assumptions representations warranties and covenants on which the opinions rely is inaccurate or incomplete or not satisfied the opinions may no longer be valid moreover the irs or state taxing authority could determine on audit that the as splitoff is taxable if it determines that any of these facts assumptions representations warranties or covenants are not correct or have been violated or if it disagrees with one or more conclusions in the opinions or for other reasons 

if the as splitoff is determined to be taxable we and possibly our stockholders could incur significant income tax liabilities these tax liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

actions taken by sungard availability services capital inc or its stockholders could cause the as splitoff to fail to qualify as a taxfree transaction and sungard availability services capital inc may be unable to fully indemnify sungard for the resulting significant tax liabilities 

pursuant to the tax sharing and disaffiliation agreement “tax sharing agreement” that sungard entered into with sungard availability services capital inc “spinco” spinco is required to indemnify sungard for certain taxes relating to the as splitoff that result from i any breach of the representations or the covenants made by spinco regarding the preservation of the intended taxfree treatment of the as splitoff ii any action or omission that is inconsistent with the representations statements warranties and covenants provided to tax counsel in connection with their delivery of tax opinions to sungard with respect to the as splitoff and iii any other action or omission that was likely to give rise to such taxes when taken in each case by spinco or any of its subsidiaries conversely if any such taxes are the result of such a breach or certain other actions or omissions by sungard sungard would be wholly responsible for such taxes in addition if any part of the as splitoff fails to qualify for the intended taxfree treatment for reasons other than those for which sungard or spinco would be wholly responsible pursuant to the provisions described above spinco will be obligated to indemnify sungard for 23 of the liability for taxes imposed in respect of the as splitoff and sungard would bear the remainder of such taxes if spinco is required to indemnify sungard for any of the foregoing reasons spinco’s indemnification liabilities could potentially exceed its net asset value and spinco may be unable to fully reimburse or indemnify sungard for its significant tax liabilities arising from the as splitoff as provided by the tax sharing agreement 

if holders of sungard stock who received fis common stock in the transaction sell that stock it could adversely affect the market price of fis common stock 

all of the shares of fis common stock issued in the acquisition were immediately available for resale in the public market subject to the limitations on resale by certain sungard stockholders during the first six months following the effective time of the mergers as a result of future sales of such common stock or the perception that these sales could occur the market price of fis common stock may be adversely affected 

we have a substantial investment in our brazilian venture and obtain significant revenue through that venture that would be lost and result in significant termination costs if our venture partner were to terminate the agreement 

revenue attributable to our brazilian venture partner banco bradesco was 2368 million  in 2015 the contract that we have with our brazilian venture partner allows for the termination or partial termination of the contract at any point during the 10year term which ends september 30 2020 this risk of contract termination is reduced by guaranteed performance targets and minimum payments that would be triggered upon the event of an early termination these payments have been established based on fis expected rate of return for the contract over a 10year period the required payments and buyouts decline each year and are further reduced by returns in excess of the expected returns for the contract and reduce the overall barrier to exiting the venture if our partner were to exit the agreement this could have a significant impact on our future revenue and growth for further detail on our brazilian venture see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements 

additionally we employ approximately 10000 employees in brazil who would have the ability to file labor claims if their employment is terminated if our brazilian venture partner were to terminate the agreement we and they may be subject to labor claims filed by employees of the brazilian venture these claims if realized could result in a significant cost and impact to our earnings 

 22 

we have substantial investments in recorded goodwill and other intangible assets as a result of prior acquisitions and a severe or extended economic downturn could cause these investments to become impaired requiring writedowns that would reduce our operating income 

as of december 31 2015 goodwill aggregated to 147 billion  or 561  of total assets and other indefinite lived intangible assets aggregated to 808 million  or 03 of total assets current accounting rules require goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets to be assessed for impairment at least annually or whenever changes in circumstances indicate potential impairment factors that may be considered a change in circumstance include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results a significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization and negative industry or economic trends the results of our 2015 annual assessment of the recoverability of goodwill indicated that the fair values of the company’s reporting units were in excess of the carrying values of those reporting units and thus no goodwill impairment existed as of december 31 2015 likewise the fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets was also in excess of the carrying value of those assets as of december 31 2015 however if worldwide or united states economic conditions decline significantly with negative impacts to bank spending and consumer behavior  or if other business or market changes impact our outlook  the carrying amount of our goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets may no longer be recoverable and we may be required to record an impairment charge which would have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

as of december 31 2015 intangible assets with finite useful lives aggregated to 50784 million  or 193 of total assets current accounting rules require intangible assets with finite useful lives to be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable factors that may be considered a change in circumstance include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results a significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization and negative industry or economic trends 

we will continue to monitor the fair value of our intangible assets as well as our market capitalization and the impact of any economic downturn on our business to determine if there is an impairment in future periods 

risks related to our indebtedness 

losses consolidations and failures in the financial services industry may impact our ability to borrow funds or the ability of our lenders to fulfill their obligations under our interest rate swap agreements 

some financial institutions continue to be challenged by negative operating results in certain cases these negative operating results have led to financial institution failures andor consolidations as a result lenders may become insolvent which could in turn make it more difficult or impossible for lenders to perform their obligations under our interest rate swap agreements or for us to borrow under our revolving loan obtain financing on favorable terms or obtain financing or interest rate swap agreements at all our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if a financial institution fails to fulfill its obligations under our interest rate swap agreements or we are unable to draw funds under our revolving loan or obtain other costeffective financing 

our existing debt levels and future levels under existing facilities and debt service requirements may adversely affect our financial condition or operational flexibility and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our outstanding indebtedness 

as of december 31 2015 we had total debt of approximately 115 billion  this level of debt or any increase in our debt level could have adverse consequences for our business financial condition operating results and operational flexibility including the following i the debt level may cause us to have difficulty borrowing money in the future for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions or other purposes ii our debt level may limit operational flexibility and our ability to pursue business opportunities and implement certain business strategies iii some of our debt has a variable rate of interest which exposes us to the risk of increased interest rates iv we have a higher level of debt than some of our competitors or potential competitors which may cause a competitive disadvantage and may reduce flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions including increased competition and vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  v there are significant maturities on our debt that we may not be able to fulfill or that may be refinanced at higher rates and vi  if we fail to satisfy our obligations under our outstanding debt or fail to comply with the financial or other restrictive covenants contained in the indenture governing our senior notes or our credit facility an event of default could result that could cause all of our debt to become due and payable

our revenue is primarily derived from a combination of recurring technology and processing services consulting and professional services and software license fees the majority of our revenue has historically been recurring provided under multiyear contracts that contribute relative stability to our revenue stream these services in general are considered critical to our clients operations a significant portion of these recurring revenues is derived from transaction processing fees that fluctuate with the level of deposit accounts and card transactions among other variable measures associated with consumer and commercial activity consulting and professional services revenues are typically nonrecurring and sales of software licenses are less predictable a portion of which can be regarded as discretionary spending by our clients in the second half of 2015 we experienced the macroeconomic challenges of a slowing in the global economy that trend impacts us predominantly in the amount our clients spend with us for professional services we expect this to continue through the first half of 2016 

       the sungard acquisition broadens our solution portfolio enabling us to expand beyond our traditional banking and payments markets into the institutional and wholesale side of financial institutions as well as other buyside organizations it significantly expands our existing solutions and client base in wealth management treasury and corporate payments these solutions are in demand among our regional and community financial institution clients as they look for ways to replace highly regulated fee revenues the combination also favorably impacts our revenue mix with a greater concentration of license revenues and higher margin services as we integrate sungard into our existing operations we anticipate significant cost savings around administration and technology expenses with a goal of achieving annual synergy runrate savings of 200 million by the end of 2017 

  

 31 

we are actively migrating many financial institutions to outsourced integrated technology solutions to improve their profitability and rapidly address increasing regulatory requirements as a provider of outsourcing solutions we benefit from multiyear recurring revenue streams which help moderate the effects of broader yeartoyear economic and market changes that otherwise might have a larger impact on our results of operations we believe our integrated solutions and outsourced services are well positioned to address this outsourcing trend across the markets we serve 

  

the realignment of resources in our global financial solutions segment resulted in severance costs of 446 million in the first quarter of 2015 additional charges were incurred in the third quarter and are included in the severance and integration activities addressed under the  selling general and administrative expenses  caption of consolidated results of operations    the realignment activities were a combination of optimizing onshore and offshore resources as well as the removal of overlapping management resources 

 consumer preference continues to shift from traditional branch banking services to digital banking solutions and our clients seek to provide a single integrated banking experience through their branch mobile internet and voice banking channels we are focused on enabling our clients to deliver this experience to their customers through our integrated solutions and services we continue to innovate and invest in these integrated solutions and services to assist clients as they address this market demand 

  

we continue to see demand for innovative solutions in the payments market that will deliver faster more convenient payment solutions in mobile channels internet applications and cards we believe mobile payments will grow and partially replace existing payment tender volumes over time as consumers and merchants embrace the convenience incremental services and benefits mobile payment volume is growing significantly but does not yet represent a meaningful amount of the payments market additionally new formidable nontraditional payments competitors and large merchants are investing in and innovating mobile payment technologies to address the emerging market opportunity and it is unclear the extent to which particular technologies or services will succeed we believe the growth of mobile payments continues to present both an opportunity and a risk to us as the market develops although we cannot predict which mobile payment technologies or solutions will be successful we cautiously believe our client relationships payments infrastructure and experience adapted solutions and emerging solutions are well positioned to maintain or grow our clients existing payment volumes which is our focus 

high profile north american merchant payment card information security breaches have pushed the payment card industry towards emv integrated circuit cards as financial institutions card networks and merchants seek to improve information security and reduce fraud costs we have invested in our card management solutions and card manufacturing and processing capabilities to accommodate emv integrated circuit cards so we can guide our clients through this anticipated technology transition and grow our card driven businesses we believe the trend to migrate to emv cards will continue and we continue to invest to address market demand 

the use of checks continues to decline as a percentage of total payments which negatively impacts our check warranty and itemprocessing businesses and we expect this trend to continue in 2014 and 2015 we observed a modest slowdown in our check volume decline and to date have been able to successfully mitigate the majority of the impacts of this decline through cost and fraud efficiency actions and new market solutions which remain our continued focus 

we anticipate consolidation within the banking industry will continue primarily in the form of merger and acquisition activity which we believe as a whole is detrimental to our business however consolidation resulting from specific merger and acquisition transactions may be beneficial or detrimental to our business when consolidations of financial institutions occur merger partners often operate systems licensed from competing service providers the newly formed entity generally makes a determination to migrate its core and payments systems to a single platform when a financial institution processing client is involved in a consolidation we may benefit by their expanding the use of our services if such services are chosen to survive the consolidation and support the newly combined entity conversely we may lose market share if we are providing services to both entities or if a client of ours is involved in a consolidation and our services are not chosen to survive the consolidation and support the newly combined entity it is also possible that larger financial institutions resulting from consolidation may have greater leverage in negotiating terms or could decide to perform inhouse some or all of the services that we currently provide or could provide we seek to mitigate the risks of consolidations by offering other competitive services to take advantage of specific opportunities at the surviving company in 2015 we have experienced lower consolidation activity and resulting termination fees compared to the same periods in the prior two years 

notwithstanding challenging global economic conditions our international business continued to experience growth across all major regions including europe and asia on a constant currency basis during the year ended december 31 2015 by 

 32 

comparison with fis a greater percentage of sungards revenues have been contributed historically by international markets which will contribute to this growth trend demand for our solutions will also be driven in developing countries by governmentled financial inclusion policies aimed to reduce the unbanked population and by growth in the middle classes in these markets driving the need for more sophisticated banking solutions the majority of our european revenue is generated by clients in the united kingdom france and germany in 2015 we have experienced adverse currency impacts in our international businesses as a consequence of a relative strengthening us dollar in 2016 we expect unfavorable foreign currency impact compared to the comparable prior year periods to continue 

  

information security 

globally attacks on information technology systems continue to grow in frequency complexity and sophistication this is a trend we expect to continue such attacks have become a point of focus for individuals businesses and governmental entities the objectives of these attacks include among other things gaining unauthorized access to systems to facilitate financial fraud disrupt operations cause denial of service events corrupt data and steal nonpublic information these circumstances present both a threat and an opportunity for fis as part of our business we electronically receive process store and transmit a wide range of confidential information including sensitive customer information and personal consumer data we also operate payment cash access and prepaid card systems 

fis remains focused on making strategic investments in information security to protect our clients and our information systems this includes both capital expenditures and operating expense on hardware software personnel and consulting services we also participate in industry and governmental initiatives to improve information security for our clients through the expertise we have gained with this ongoing focus and involvement we have developed fraud security risk management and compliance solutions to target this growth opportunity in the financial services industry 

critical accounting policies 

the accounting policies described below are those we consider critical in preparing our consolidated financial statements these policies require management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures with respect to contingent liabilities and assets at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods actual amounts could differ from those estimates see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed description of the significant accounting policies that have been followed in preparing our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

the company generates revenues from the delivery of bank processing credit and debit card processing services other payment processing services professional services software licensing software as a service saas cloud revenue and software related services revenues are recognized when evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred fees are fixed or determinable and collection is considered probable we are frequently a party to multiple concurrent contracts with the same client these situations require judgment to determine whether the individual contracts should be aggregated or evaluated separately for purposes of revenue recognition in making this determination we consider the timing of negotiating and executing the contracts whether the different elements of the contracts are interdependent and whether any of the payment terms of the contracts are interrelated our individual contracts also frequently include multiple elements we must apply judgment in these circumstances in determining whether individual elements can be considered separate units of accounting or should instead be accounted for in combination with other deliverables judgment is also required in ascribing fair value to each deliverable for purposes of allocating consideration due to the large number broad nature and average size of individual contracts we are party to the impact of judgments and assumptions that we apply in recognizing revenue for any single contract is not likely to have a material effect on our consolidated operations or financial position however the broader accounting policy assumptions that we apply across similar arrangements or classes of clients could significantly influence the timing and amount of revenue recognized in our historical and future results of operations or financial position additional information about our revenue recognition policies is included in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements 

computer software 

computer software includes the fair value of software acquired in business combinations purchased software and capitalized software development costs purchased software is recorded at cost and amortized using the straightline method over its estimated useful life and software acquired in business combinations is recorded at its fair value and amortized using straightline or accelerated methods over its estimated useful life 

 33 

the capitalization of software development costs is governed by fasb asc subtopic 98520 if the software is to be sold leased or otherwise marketed or by fasb asc subtopic 35040 if the software is for internal use after the technological feasibility of the software has been established for software to be marketed or at the beginning of application development for internaluse software software development costs which include primarily salaries and related payroll costs and costs of independent contractors incurred during development are capitalized research and development costs incurred prior to the establishment of technological feasibility for software to be marketed or prior to application development for internaluse software are expensed as incurred software development costs are amortized on a productbyproduct basis commencing on the date of general release of the products for software to be marketed or the date placed in service for internaluse software software development costs for software to be marketed are amortized using the greater of 1 the straightline method over its estimated useful life which ranges from three to 10 years or 2 the ratio of current revenues to total anticipated revenues over its useful life 

in determining useful lives management considers historical results and technological trends that may influence the estimate useful lives for all computer software range from three to 10 years we also assess the recorded value of computer software for impairment on a regular basis by comparing the carrying value to the estimated future cash flows to be generated by the underlying software asset for software to be marketed there are inherent uncertainties in determining the expected useful life or cash flows to be generated from computer software while we have not historically experienced significant changes in these estimates our results of operations could be subject to such changes in the future 

purchase accounting goodwill and other intangible assets 

we are required to allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction at their estimated fair values the estimates used to determine the fair value of longlived assets such as intangible assets are complex and require a significant amount of management judgment we generally engage independent valuation specialists to assist us in making fair value determinations 

if the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the combination occurs we are required to record provisional amounts in the financial statements for the items for which the accounting is incomplete adjustments to provisional amounts initially recorded that are identified during the measurement period are recognized in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined this includes any effect on earnings of changes in depreciation amortization or other income effects as a result of the change to the provisional amounts calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date during the measurement period we are also required to recognize additional assets or liabilities if new information is obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that if known would have resulted in the recognition of those assets and liabilities as of that date the measurement period ends the sooner of one year from the combination date or when we receive the information we were seeking about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date or we learn that more information is not obtainable 

we are also required to estimate the useful lives of intangible assets to determine the amount of acquisitionrelated intangible asset amortization expense to record in future periods we periodically review the estimated useful lives assigned to our finitelived intangible assets to determine whether such estimated useful lives continue to be appropriate additionally we review our indefinitelived intangible assets to determine if there is any change in circumstances that may indicate the asset’s useful life is no longer indefinite 

goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives should not be amortized but shall be tested for impairment annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate potential impairment fasb asc topic 350 allows an entity first to assess qualitatively whether it is more likely than not that a reporting units carrying amount exceeds its fair value referred to in the guidance as step zero if an entity concludes that it is more likely than not that a reporting units fair value is less than its carrying amount that is a likelihood of more than 50 percent the step one quantitative assessment must be performed for that reporting unit asc topic 350 provides examples of events and circumstances that should be considered in performing the step zero qualitative assessment including macroeconomic conditions industry and market considerations cost factors overall financial performance events affecting a reporting unit or the entity as a whole and a sustained decrease in share price   

in applying the quantitative analysis we determine the fair value of our reporting units based on a weighted average of multiple valuation techniques principally a combination of an income approach and a market approach the income approach calculates a value based upon the present value of estimated future cash flows while the market approach uses earnings multiples of similarly situated guideline public companies if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the reporting unit’s net assets goodwill is not impaired and further testing is not required we engaged independent specialists to 

 34 

perform valuations of our reporting units effective january 1 2015 in conjunction with our resegmentation and prior to that in 2012 as part of our annual impairment test there was a substantial excess of fair value over carrying value for each of our reporting units in both the 2015 and 2012 independent valuations 

  we assess goodwill for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter using a september 30th measurement date unless circumstances require a more frequent measurement as was the case in the first quarter of 2015 for each of 2015 2014 and 2013 we began our annual impairment test with the step zero qualitative analysis in performing the step zero qualitative analysis for each year examining those factors most likely to affect our valuations we concluded that it remained more likely than not that the fair value of each of our reporting units continued to exceed their carrying amounts consequently we did not perform a step one quantitative analysis specifically for the purpose of our annual impairment test in any year presented in these financial statements 

we also estimate the fair value of acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives and compare this amount to the underlying carrying value annually similar to the asc topic 350 guidance for goodwill asc section 3601035 allows an organization to first perform a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that an intangible asset has been impaired 

we engaged independent specialists to perform a valuation of our indefinite lived intangible assets in 2015 and prior to that in 2012 using a form of income approach valuation known as the relieffromroyalty method for 2015 we proceeded directly to a step one quantitative analysis there was a substantial excess of fair value over carrying value for each of our indefinite lived intangible assets in the 2015 independent valuations for 2014 and 2013 we began our assessment of indefinite lived intangibles with the step zero qualitative analysis because there was a substantial excess of fair value over carrying value for each of our indefinitelived intangible assets based on the 2012 valuation based upon the results of these assessments there were no indications of impairment except for one trademark with nominal value in 2013 

determining the fair value of a reporting unit or acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives involves judgment and the use of significant estimates and assumptions which include assumptions regarding the revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate estimated future cash flows riskadjusted discount rates and future economic and market conditions and other assumptions 

accounting for income taxes 

as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements we are required to determine income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate this process involves estimating actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing recognition of items for income tax and financial reporting purposes these differences result in deferred income tax assets and liabilities which are included within the consolidated balance sheets we must then assess the likelihood that deferred income tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely establish a valuation allowance to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase or decrease this allowance in a period we must reflect this increase or decrease as an expense or benefit within income tax expense in the consolidated statements of earnings determination of the income tax expense requires estimates and can involve complex issues that may require an extended period to resolve further changes in the geographic mix of revenues or in the estimated level of annual pretax income can cause the overall effective income tax rate to vary from period to period we also receive periodic assessments from taxing authorities challenging our positions that must be taken into consideration in determining our tax reserves resolving these assessments which may or may not result in additional taxes due may also require an extended period of time we believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and we adequately account for any known tax contingencies we believe the estimates and assumptions used to support our evaluation of tax benefit realization are reasonable however final determination of prioryear tax liabilities either by settlement with tax authorities or expiration of statutes of limitations could be materially different than estimates reflected in assets and liabilities and historical income tax provisions the outcome of these final determinations could have a material effect on our income tax provision net income or cash flows in the period that a determination is made

processing and services revenues 

processing and services revenues totaled 65952 million  64138 million  and 60634 million  in 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively the increase in revenue during 2015  of 1814 million  or 28  as compared to 2014  is primarily attributable to incremental revenues from the acquisitions of sungard clear2pay and reliance as well as card production activities associated with the rollout of emv cards across the industry and growth in digital solutions and in core banking these increases were partially offset by the loss of a major customer in the prior year period the divestiture of our gaming industry check warranty business and 2431 million of unfavorable foreign currency impact primarily resulting from a stronger us dollar versus the brazilian real and the euro the increase in revenue during 2014  of 3504 million  or 58  as compared to 2013  was primarily attributable to increased demand for implementation and consulting services incremental revenues from 2013 and 2014 acquisitions of 832 million and growth from our international operations resulting from our expanded 

 37 

presence across europe and asia the 2014  period included 374 million of unfavorable foreign currency impact resulting from a stronger us dollar as compared to 2013  

cost of revenues and gross profit 

cost of revenues totaled 43932 million  43283 million  and 40927 million  in 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively resulting in gross profit of 22020 million  20855 million  and 19707 million  in 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively gross profit as a percentage of revenues “gross margin” was 334  325  and 325  in 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively the increase in gross profit during 2015  as compared to 2014  primarily resulted from the revenue variances discussed above the increase in gross profit percentage for 2015  as compared to 2014  primarily resulted from proportionately higher license fees and lower professional services and consulting revenue the restructuring activities taken earlier in the year in europe as a result of our reorganization and reductions in variable costs where performance did not meet expectations these items were partially offset by the impact of lower termination fees in 2015  the increase in gross profit during 2014  as compared to 2013  primarily resulted from the revenue variances discussed above 

  

selling general and administrative expenses 

selling general and administrative expenses totaled 11028 million  8149 million  and 9078 million  for 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively the 2015  increase of 2879 million  as compared to 2014  primarily resulted from transaction costs severance and costs of integration activities relating to acquisitions totaling 1713 million severance costs of 446 million in conjunction with the reorganization and streamlining of operations in our gfs segment and other incremental expenses of acquired companies the 2014  decrease of 929 million  as compared to 2013  was primarily due to 2013  charges of 1311 million for the capco acquisition related adjustments described in note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements this decrease was partially offset by 2014 onetime transaction costs including integration activities related to acquisitions and other severance costs the 2014  period also included lower sales and marketing expense a decrease in healthcare benefit expense and decreased investment in security and risk management 

operating income 

operating income totaled 10992 million  12706 million  and 10629 million  for 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively operating income as a percentage of revenue “operating margin” was 167  198  and 175  for 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively the annual changes in operating income and operating margin resulted from the revenue and cost variances addressed above 

total other income expense 

total other income expense was 623 million  2172 million  and 2394 million  for 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively other income expense net for the 2015 period includes financing costs of 170 million relating to the sungard acquisition during the second quarter of 2015 we sold certain assets associated with our gaming industry check warranty business resulting in proceeds of 2375 million and a pretax gain of 1394 million which is included in other income expense net other income expense net for 2014 includes a loss of 162 on a foreign currency forward contract associated with the eurobased purchase price for our clear2pay acquisition the writeoff of certain previously capitalized debt issuance costs of 70 million and the payment of a 295 million bond premium associated with the early redemption of certain debt 

interest expense totaled 1991 million  1728 million  and 1986 million  for 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively the increase of 263 million  in interest expense in 2015  as compared to 2014  is primarily due to higher outstanding debt associated with financing the sungard acquisition partially offset by lower borrowing rates as the result of the debt refinancing activity undertaken during 2014 the decrease of 258 million  in interest expense in 2014  as compared to 2013  resulted from lower borrowing rates as the result of debt refinancing 

provision for income taxes 

income tax expense from continuing operations totaled 3788 million  3351 million  and 3089 million  for 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively this resulted in an effective tax rate on continuing operations of 365  318  and 375  for 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively the effective tax rate increase for the 2015 period is attributable to a 901 million writeoff of goodwill with no tax basis in connection with the sale of our gaming industry check warranty business resulting in a book gain on sale lower than the tax gain during 2014 we realized tax benefits related to certain acquired net operating loss carryovers this and certain favorable audit resolutions in 2014 contributed to the rate differential for the 2014 period 

earnings loss from discontinued operations 

 38 

during 2015  2014  and 2013  certain operations are classified as discontinued as discussed in note 3 of the notes to consolidated financial statements reporting for discontinued operations classifies revenues and expenses as one line item net of tax in the consolidated statements of earnings the table below outlines the components of discontinued operations for 2015  2014  and 2013  net of tax in millions 



during the second quarter of 2014 the company committed to a plan to sell our business operation that provides ecas core banking software solutions to small financial institutions in china because it did not align with our strategic plans we entered into a purchase agreement in january 2015 to sell this business and the transaction closed during the second quarter of 2015  

on january 1 2010 fis sold certain assets and liabilities constituting our clearpar automated syndicated loan trade settlement business terms of the sale included an initial cash payment of 715 million  at closing with the potential for an additional contingent earnout payment calculated as a function of the business 2012 operating results in may 2013 we recorded in discontinued operations a gain of 268 million   167 million  net of tax upon final determination and receipt of the earnout payment 

participacoes our former item processing and remittance services business in brazil had no revenue in 2015  2014  and 2013  participacoes processing volume was transitioned to other vendors or back to its clients during the second quarter of 2011 participacoes had charges associated with shutdown activities of 52 million  101 million  and 231 million  during the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively the shutdown activities involved the transfer and termination of approximately 2600  employees which was completed in 2011 former employees generally had up to two years  from the date of terminations extended through april 2013 to file labor claims and a number of them did file labor claims as of december 31 2015  there were approximately 550  active claims remaining consequently we have continued exposure on these active claims which were not transferred with other assets and liabilities in the disposal 

in 2004 proservvi empreendimentos e servicios ltda the predecessor to fidelity national servicos de tratamento de documentos e informatica ltda “servicos” a subsidiary of participacoes acquired certain assets and employees and leased certain facilities from the transpev group “transpev” in brazil transpev’s remaining assets were later acquired by prosegur an unrelated third party when transpev discontinued its operations after the asset sale to prosegur it had unpaid federal taxes and social contributions owing to the brazilian tax authorities the brazilian tax authorities brought a claim against transpev and beginning in 2012 brought claims against prosegur and servicos on the grounds that that prosegur and servicos were successors in interest to transpev to date the brazilian tax authorities have filed five  claims against servicos asserting potential tax liabilities of approximately 58 million  there are potentially 31  additional claims against transpevprosegur for which servicos is named as a codefendant or may be named but for which servicos has not yet been served these additional claims amount to approximately 581 million  making the total potential exposure for all 36  claims approximately 639 million  we do not believe a liability for these 36  total claims is probable or reasonably estimable and therefore have not recorded a liability for any of these claims 

net earnings loss attributable to noncontrolling interest 

net earnings loss attributable to noncontrolling interest predominantly relates to the joint venture in brazil see note 5 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and totaled 193 million  278 million  and 246 million  for 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively 

earnings from continuing operations net of tax attributable to fis common stockholders 

earnings from continuing operations net of tax attributable to fis common stockholders totaled 6388 million  6905 million  and 4900 million  for 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively or 221  239  and 167  per diluted share respectively due to the factors described above coupled with the impact of our share repurchase initiatives

segment results of operations 

integrated financial solutions 



revenues for ifs totaled 39289 million  38588 million  and 37120 million  for 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively the overall segment increase of 701 million  or 18  for 2015  as compared to 2014  was primarily attributable to incremental revenues from our 2014 acquisition of reliance card production activities and growth in digital and risk solutions these increases were partially offset by the net reporting of revenue associated with a change in vendor in our loyalty business the impact of recent divestitures and lower termination fees revenue had been recognized on a gross basis under the previous loyalty arrangement based on the contractual responsibilities for which fis had been responsible the overall segment increase of 1468 million  or 40  for 2014  as compared to 2013  was primarily attributable to growth in 1 consulting and professional services particularly in risk and compliance and community core banking 2 mobile and ebanking solutions and 3 incremental revenues from our 2014 acquisition of reliance which is addressed in note 6 to the consolidated financial statements these increases were partially offset by lower termination fees 

operating income for ifs totaled 13428 million  13148 million  and 12876 million  for 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively operating margin was 342  341  and 347  for 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively the increase in operating income during 2015  as compared to 2014  primarily resulted from the revenue variances discussed above the operating margin for 2015  as compared to 2014  primarily reflects the impact of cost containment initiatives and reductions in variable costs where performance did not meet expectations partially offset by lower termination fees in 2015  the increase in operating income during 2014  as compared to 2013  primarily resulted from the revenue variances discussed above the decrease in operating margin during 2014  as compared to 2013  resulted primarily because 2013 benefited from higher termination fees 

global financial solutions 



revenues for gfs totaled 27171 million  25573 million  and 23539 million  for 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively the 2015  period included 2415 million of unfavorable foreign currency impact primarily resulting from a stronger us dollar versus the brazilian real and the euro the revenue increase for 2015  as compared to 2014  was principally due to 1 incremental revenue from the acquisitions of sungard and clear2pay 2 our expanding presence in india including core banking and payments 3 growth in europe primarily in core banking and payment solution and 4 growth in latin america from transaction volumes card issuances and expanded back office services the 2014  period included 357 million of unfavorable foreign currency impact primarily resulting from a stronger us dollar versus the brazilian real and the euro the revenue increase for 2014  as compared to 2013  was principally due to growth in implementation and consulting services continued growth in emea and asia and incremental revenues from our 2014 and 2013 acquisitions 

operating income for gfs totaled 4480 million  3869 million  and 3500 million  for 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively operating margin was 165  151  and 149  for 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively the increase in operating income during 2015  as compared to 2014  primarily resulted from the revenue variances discussed above the increase in operating margin during 2015  as compared to 2014  primarily resulted from growth in high margin license deals the restructuring activities undertaken earlier in the year in europe as a result of our reorganization and reductions in variable costs where performance did not meet expectations the impact of these items was partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates the increase in operating income during 2014  as compared to 2013  primarily resulted from the revenue variances discussed above the increase in operating margin for 2014  as compared to 2013  was primarily due to 2013  charges of 220 million to increase the capco acquisition related liabilities discussed in note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial

liquidity and capital resources 

cash requirements 

our ongoing cash requirements include operating expenses income taxes mandatory debt service payments capital expenditures stockholder dividends working capital and timing differences in settlementrelated assets and liabilities and may include discretionary debt repayments share repurchases and business acquisitions our cash requirements also include payments for capcos contingent consideration earnout and for labor claims related to fis former item processing and remittance operations in brazil see notes 6 and 3 respectively of the notes to consolidated financial statements our principal sources of funds are cash generated by operations and borrowings including the capacity under our revolving loan described in note 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements

we currently expect to continue to pay quarterly dividends however the amount declaration and payment of future dividends is at the discretion of the board of directors and depends on among other things our investment opportunities results of operations financial condition cash requirements future prospects and other factors that may be considered relevant by our board of directors including legal and contractual restrictions additionally the payment of cash dividends may be limited by covenants in certain debt agreements a regular quarterly dividend of 026 per common share is payable on march 31 2016 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on march 17 2016

recent accounting pronouncements 

        recently adopted accounting guidance 

in april 2014 the fasb issued asu 201408 “presentation of financial statements topic 205 and property plant and equipment topic 360 reporting discontinued operations and disclosures of disposals of components of an entity” “asu 201408” the standard raises the threshold for a disposal to qualify as a discontinued operation to one representing a strategic shift that has a major effect on the organization’s operations and financial results the standard requires new disclosures of both discontinued operations and certain other disposals that do not meet the definition of a discontinued operation asu 201408 was effective for fis as of january 1 2015 this pronouncement could impact the presentation of future divestitures that may have qualified as discontinued operations in the past but do not meet the higher threshold of asu 201408 

recent accounting guidance not yet adopted 

  

 42 

in may 2014 the fasb issued asu 201409 “revenue from contracts with customers topic 606” “asu 

201409” asu 201409 amends substantially all authoritative literature for revenue recognition including industryspecific 

requirements and converges the guidance under this topic with that of the international financial reporting standards the 

asu implements a fivestep process for customer contract revenue recognition that focuses on transfer of control as opposed 

to transfer of risk and rewards the amendment also requires enhanced disclosures regarding the nature amount timing and 

uncertainty of revenues and cash flows from contracts with customers other provisions include ensuring the time value of 

money is considered in the transaction price and allowing estimates of variable consideration to be recognized before 

contingencies are resolved in certain circumstances the effective date to the amendments was postponed to reporting periods beginning after december 15 2017 with early adoption allowed for reporting periods beginning after december 15 2016 entities can transition to the standard either with retrospective application to the earlier years presented in their financial statements or with a cumulativeeffect adjustment as of the date of adoption we are currently assessing the impact the adoption of asu 201409 will have on our financial position and results of operations as well as the transition method we expect to employ 

       in september 2015 the fasb issued asu no 201516 business combinations topic 805 simplifying the accounting for measurementperiod adjustments asu 201516 asu 201516 requires adjustments to provisional amounts initially recorded in a business combination that are identified during the measurement period to be recognized in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined this includes any effect on earnings of changes in depreciation amortization or other income effects as a result of the change to the provisional amounts calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date asu 201516 also requires an entity to present separately on the face of the income statement or disclose in the notes the portion of the amount recorded in currentperiod earnings by line item that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date prior to the issuance of the standard entities were required to retrospectively apply adjustments made to provisional amounts recognized in a business combination the guidance is effective for the fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december 15 2015 this guidance will require fis to record and disclose any measurementperiod adjustments for the sungard acquisition or other future business combinations as current period adjustments as opposed to retroactive adjustments to the opening balance sheet of the acquired entity 

       on february 25 2016 the fasb issued asu 201602 “leases topic 842” “asu 201602” under the new guidance lessees will be required to recognize the following for all leases with the exception of leases with a term of twelve months or less at the commencement date a a lease liability which is a lessee‘s obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease measured on a discounted basis and b a rightofuse asset which is an asset that represents the lessee’s right to use or control the use of a specified asset for the lease term under the new guidance lessor accounting is largely unchanged the pronouncement requires a modified retrospective transition approach for leases existing at or entered into after the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements the modified retrospective approach would not require any transition accounting for leases that expire before the earliest comparative period presented a full retrospective transition approach is not permitted public business entities should apply the amendments in asu 201602 for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2018 including interim periods within those fiscal years early application is permitted we are currently assessing the impact the adoption of asu 201602 will have on our financial position and results of operations

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risks 

tableend 

  market risk 

we are exposed to market risks primarily from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates we use certain derivative financial instruments including interest rate swaps and foreign currency forward contracts to manage interest rate and foreign currency risk we do not use derivatives for trading purposes to generate income or to engage in speculative activity 

interest rate risk 

in addition to existing cash balances and cash provided by operating activities we use fixed rate and variable rate debt to finance our operations we are exposed to interest rate risk on these debt obligations and related interest rate swaps 

the senior notes as described in note 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements represent substantially all of our fixedrate longterm debt obligations as of december 31 2015 the carrying value of the notes was 74500 million  as of december 31 2015  the fair value of the senior notes was approximately 74789 million  as of december 31 2015  the potential reduction in fair value of the senior notes from a hypothetical 10  percent increase in market interest rates would not be material to the overall fair value of the debt 

 43 

our floating rate longterm debt obligations principally relate to borrowings under the fis credit agreements as defined in note 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements an increase of 100 basis points in the libor rate would increase our annual debt service under the fis credit agreements after we include the impact of our interest rate swaps by 230 million  based on principal amounts outstanding as of december 31 2015  we performed the foregoing sensitivity analysis based on the principal amount of our floating rate debt as of december 31 2015  less the principal amount of such debt that was then subject to an interest rate swap converting such debt into fixed rate debt this sensitivity analysis is based solely on the principal amount of such debt as of december 31 2015  and does not take into account any changes that occurred in the prior 12 months or that may take place in the next 12 months in the amount of our outstanding debt or in the notional amount of outstanding interest rate swaps in respect of our debt further in this sensitivity analysis the change in interest rates is assumed to be applicable for an entire year for comparison purposes based on principal amounts of floating rate debt outstanding as of december 31 2014  and calculated in the same manner as set forth above an increase of 100 basis points in the libor rate would have increased our annual interest expense after we calculate the impact of our interest rate swaps by 143 million  

we use interest rate swaps for the purpose of managing our interest expense through the mix of fixed rate and floating rate debt during the year ended december 31 2015  the notional amount of our outstanding interest rate swaps increased by 11500 million  as of december 31 2015  we have entered into the following interest rate swap transactions converting a portion of the interest rate exposure on our term and revolving loans from variable to fixed in millions 



 

 we have designated these interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes a portion of the amount included in accumulated other comprehensive earnings is reclassified into interest expense as a yield adjustment as interest payments are made on the term and revolving loans in accordance with the authoritative guidance for fair value measurements the inputs used to determine the estimated fair value of our interest rate swaps are level 2type measurements we considered our own credit risk and the credit risk of the counterparties when determining the fair value of our interest rate swaps 

       in september 2015 in contemplation of issuing longterm financing for the sungard acquisition the company entered into treasury lock hedges with a total notional amount of 10 billion  reducing the risk of changes in the benchmark index component of the 10year treasury yield the company designated these derivatives as cash flow hedges on october 13 2015 in conjunction with the pricing of the 45 billion  senior notes the company terminated these treasury lock contracts for a cash settlement payment of 159 million  which was recorded as a component of other comprehensive earnings and will be reclassified as an adjustment to interest expense over the ten  years during which the related interest payments that were hedged will be recognized in income 

foreign currency risk 

we are exposed to foreign currency risks that arise from normal business operations these risks include the translation of local currency balances of foreign subsidiaries transaction gains and losses associated with intercompany loans with foreign subsidiaries and transactions denominated in currencies other than a locations functional currency our objective is to minimize our exposure to these risks through a combination of normal operating activities and the use of foreign currency forward contracts contracts are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries 

our exposure to foreign currency exchange risks generally arises from our nonus operations to the extent they are conducted in local currency changes in foreign currency exchange rates affect translations of revenues denominated in 

 44 

currencies other than the us dollar during the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  our international operations generated approximately 13361 million  12285 million  and 10868 million  respectively in revenues denominated in currencies other than the us dollar the major currencies to which our revenues are exposed are the brazilian real the euro the british pound sterling and the indian rupee a 10 move in average exchange rates for these currencies assuming a simultaneous and immediate 10 change in all of such rates for the relevant period would have resulted in the following increase or decrease in our reported revenues for the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  in millions 



while our results of operations have been impacted by the effects of currency fluctuations our international operations revenues and expenses are generally denominated in local currency which reduces our economic exposure to foreign exchange risk in those jurisdictions 

  

revenues included 2431 million  and 374 million  and operating income included 313 million  and 89 million  respectively of unfavorable foreign currency impact during 2015  and 2014  resulting from a stronger us dollar during these years compared to the preceding year in 2016 we expect a moderate increase in unfavorable foreign currency impact on our operating income resulting from the continued strengthening of us dollar vs other currencies 

our foreign exchange risk management policy permits the use of derivative instruments such as forward contracts and options to reduce volatility in our results of operations andor cash flows resulting from foreign exchange rate fluctuations we do not enter into foreign currency derivative instruments for trading purposes we do periodically enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency exposure to intercompany loans as of december 31 2015  the notional amount of these derivatives was approximately 810 million  and the fair value was nominal these derivatives are intended to hedge the foreign exchange risks related to intercompany loans but have not been designated as hedges for accounting purposes 

        our subsidiary sungard see note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements historically used currency forward contracts to manage its exposure to fluctuations in costs caused by variations in indian rupee “inr” exchange rates the company assumed certain of these contracts in connection with the acquisition and entered into additional contracts in december 2015 as of december 31 2015 the notional amount of these derivatives was approximately 501 million  and the fair value was 14 million  these inr forward contracts are designated as cash flow hedges the fair value of these currency forward contracts is determined using currency exchange market rates obtained from reliable independent third party banks at the balance sheet date the fair value of forward contracts is subject to changes in currency exchange rates the company has no ineffectiveness related to its use of currency forward contracts in connection with inr cash flow hedges 

in conjunction with entering into the definitive agreement to acquire clear2pay in september 2014 we initiated a foreign currency forward contract to purchase euros and sell us dollars to manage the risk arising from fluctuations in exchange rates until the closing because the purchase price was stated in euros as this derivative did not qualify for hedge accounting we recorded a charge of 162 million  in other income expense net during the third quarter of 2014 this forward contract was settled on october 1 2014

risk factors 

tableend 

in addition to the normal risks of business we are subject to significant risks and uncertainties including those listed below and others described elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k any of the risks described herein could result in a significant adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

risks related to our business and operations 

entity mergers or consolidations and business failures in the banking and financial services industry could adversely affect our business by eliminating some of our existing and potential clients and making us more dependent on a more limited number of clients 

there has been and continues to be substantial consolidation activity in the banking and financial services industry in addition many financial institutions that experienced negative operating results including some of our clients have failed these consolidations and failures reduce our number of potential clients and may reduce our number of existing clients which could adversely affect our revenues even if the events do not reduce the aggregate activities of the consolidated entities further if our clients fail andor merge with or are acquired by other entities that are not our clients or that use fewer of our services they may discontinue or reduce use of our services it is also possible that larger financial institutions resulting from consolidations would have greater leverage in negotiating terms or could decide to perform inhouse some or all of the services that we currently provide or could provide any of these developments could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

if we fail to innovate or adapt our services to changes in technology or in the marketplace or if our ongoing efforts to upgrade our technology are not successful we could lose clients or our clients could lose customers and have difficulty attracting new clients for our services 

the markets for our services are characterized by constant technological changes frequent introductions of new services and evolving industry standards our future success will be significantly affected by our ability to enhance our current services and develop and introduce new services that address the increasingly sophisticated needs of our clients and their customers these initiatives carry the risks associated with any new service development effort including cost overruns delays in delivery and performance issues there can be no assurance that we will be successful in developing marketing and selling new services that meet these changing demands that we will not experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development introduction and marketing of these services or that our new services and their enhancements will adequately meet the demands of the marketplace and achieve market acceptance any of these developments could have an adverse impact on our future revenues andor business prospects 

we operate in a competitive business environment and if we are unable to compete effectively our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 

the market for our services is intensely competitive our competitors vary in size and in the scope and breadth of the services they offer some of our competitors have substantial resources we face direct competition from third parties and since many of our larger potential clients have historically developed their key applications inhouse and therefore view their system requirements from a makeversusbuy perspective we often compete against our potential clients’ inhouse capacities in addition we expect that the markets in which we compete will continue to attract new competitors and new technologies there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors or that the competitive pressures we face in the markets in which we operate will not materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations see item i business competition 

 10 

global economic political and other conditions including business cycles and consumer confidence may adversely affect our clients or trends in consumer spending which may adversely impact the demand for our services and our revenue and profitability 

a significant portion of our revenue is derived from transaction processing fees the global transaction processing industries depend heavily upon the overall level of consumer business and government spending any change in economic factors including a sustained deterioration in general economic conditions or consumer confidence particularly in the united states or increases in interest rates in key countries in which we operate may adversely affect consumer spending including related consumer debt reduce check writing and change credit and debit card usage and as a result adversely affect our financial performance by reducing the number or average purchase amount of transactions that we service 

constraints within global financial markets or international regulatory requirements could constrain our financial institution clients ability to purchase our services impacting our future growth and profitability 

a significant number of our clients and potential clients may hold sovereign debt of economically struggling nations or be subject to emerging international requirements such as basel iii which could require changes in their capitalization and hence the amount of their working capital available to purchase our services these potential constraints could alter the ability of clients or potential clients to purchase our services and thus could have a significant impact on our future growth and profitability 

potential clients may be reluctant to switch to a new vendor which may adversely affect our growth 

for banks and other potential clients of our financial information software and services switching from one vendor of bank core processing or related software and services or from an internallydeveloped system to a new vendor is a significant undertaking many potential clients perceive potential disadvantages such as loss of accustomed functionality increased costs including conversion costs and business disruption as a result potential clients may resist change we seek to overcome this resistance through value enhancing strategies such as a defined conversion process system integration including bundling additional services and making ongoing investments to enhance the functionality of our software however there can be no assurance that our strategies for overcoming potential clients’ reluctance to change vendors will be successful and this resistance may adversely affect our growth 

the sales and implementation cycles for many of our software and service offerings can be lengthy and require significant investment from both our clients and fis if we fail to close sales or if a client chooses not to complete an installation after expending significant time and resources to do so our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 

the sales and associated deployment of many of our software or service offerings often involve significant capital commitments by our clients andor fis potential clients generally commit significant resources to an evaluation of available software and services and require us to expend substantial time effort and money educating them prior to sales further as part of the sale or deployment of our software and services clients may also require fis to perform significant related services to complete a proof of concept or custom development to meet their needs all of the aforementioned activities may expend significant funds and management resources and ultimately the client may determine not to close the sale or complete the implementation if we are unsuccessful in closing sales or if the client decides not to complete an implementation after we expend significant funds and management resources or we experience delays it could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

failure to obtain new clients or renew client contracts on favorable terms could adversely affect results of operations and financial condition 

we may face pricing pressure in obtaining and retaining our larger clients larger clients may be able to seek price reductions from us when they renew a contract when a contract is extended or when the clients business has significant volume changes they may also reduce services if they decide to move services inhouse further our smaller and midsize clients may exert pricing pressure due to pricing competition or other economic needs or pressures being experienced by the client on some occasions this pricing pressure results in lower revenue from a client than we had anticipated based on our previous agreement with that client this reduction in revenue could result in an adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

further failure to renew client contracts on favorable terms could have an adverse effect on our business our contracts with clients generally run for several years and include liquidated damage provisions that provide for early termination fees term 

 11 

s are generally renegotiated prior to the end of a contracts term if we are not successful in achieving a high rate of contract renewals on favorable terms our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

we may experience defects development delays installation difficulties system failure or other service disruptions with respect to our technology solutions or execution problems with our transformation services which would harm our business and reputation and expose us to potential liability 

many of our services including our transformation services are based on sophisticated software and computing systems and we may encounter delays when developing new technology solutions and services further the technology solutions underlying our services have occasionally contained and may in the future contain undetected errors or defects when first introduced or when new versions are released in addition we may experience difficulties in installing or integrating our technologies on platforms used by our clients or our clients may cancel a project after we have expended significant effort and resources to complete an installation finally our systems and operations could be exposed to damage or interruption from fire natural disaster power loss telecommunications failure unauthorized entry and computer viruses defects in our technology solutions errors or delays in the processing of electronic transactions or other difficulties could result in i interruption of business operations ii delay in market acceptance iii additional development and remediation costs iv diversion of technical and other resources v loss of clients vi negative publicity or vii exposure to liability claims any one or more of the foregoing could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations although we attempt to limit our potential liability through controls including system redundancies security controls application development and testing controls and disclaimers and limitationofliability provisions in our license and client agreements we cannot be certain that these measures will always be successful in preventing disruption or limiting our liability 

the doddfrank act may result in business changes for our clients that could have an adverse effect on our financial condition revenues results of operations or prospects for future growth and overall business  

our clients and as a result our associated software and services are required to comply with numerous regulations the doddfrank act and associated durbin amendment were passed and signed into law in 2010 the doddfrank act represents a comprehensive overhaul of the regulations governing the financial services industry within the united states the act established the consumer financial protection bureau and will require this and other federal agencies to implement many new regulations which have the potential to increase the amount and types of regulation on areas of our business that were not previously regulated 

several new regulations and rules will be written and implemented as directed by the aforementioned legislation these new rules and regulations will require our clients or potential clients to comply with new requirements and could require us to directly comply with new regulations these new requirements could result in the need for fis to make capital investments to modify our products and services to facilitate our clients and potential clients compliance as well as to deploy additional processes or reporting to comply with new regulations further requirements of the new regulations could result in changes in our clients business practices and those of other marketplace participants that may alter the delivery of services to consumers which could impact the demand for our software and services as well as alter the type or volume of transactions that we process on behalf of our clients as a result these new requirements could have an adverse impact on our financial condition revenues results of operations prospects for future growth and overall business 

many of our clients are subject to a regulatory environment and to industry standards that may change in a manner that reduces the number of transactions in which our clients engage and therefore reduces our revenues 

our clients are subject to a number of government regulations and industry standards with which our services must comply our clients must ensure that our services and related products work within the extensive and evolving regulatory and industry requirements applicable to them federal state foreign or industry authorities could adopt laws rules or regulations affecting our clients businesses that could lead to increased operating costs and could reduce the convenience and functionality of our products and services possibly resulting in reduced market acceptance in addition action by regulatory authorities relating to credit availability data usage privacy or other related regulatory developments could have an adverse effect on our clients and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

regulations enacted by the consumer financial protection bureau may require fis to enact new business practices which may require capital investment andor incremental expenses which could impact our future operating results 

the consumer financial protection bureau regulates financial and nonfinancial institutions and providers to those organizations the cfpb is establishing its regulatory agenda and will likely pass additional rules for regulating nonfinancial institution providers to ensure adequate protection of consumer privacy and to ensure consumers are not impacted by deceptive 

 12 

business practices the impact of these rules may require fis or its subsidiaries to be subject to additional regulation and adopt additional business practices that could require additional capital expenditures or impact our operating results 

our revenues from the sale of services to members of visa mastercard american express discover and other similar organizations are dependent upon our continued certification and sponsorship and the loss or suspension of certification or sponsorship could adversely affect our business 

in order to provide our card processing services we must be certified including applicable sponsorship by visa mastercard american express discover and other similar organizations these certifications are dependent upon our continued adherence to the standards of the issuing bodies and sponsoring member banks the member financial institutions some of which are our competitors set the standards with which we must comply if we fail to comply with these standards we could be fined our certifications could be suspended or our registration could be terminated the suspension or termination of our certifications or any changes in the rules and regulations governing visa mastercard american express discover or other similar organizations could result in a reduction in revenue or increased costs of operation which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business 

changes in card association and debit network fees or products could increase costs or otherwise limit our operations 

from time to time card associations and debit networks increase the interchange fees that they charge it is possible that competitive pressures will result in our absorption of a portion of such increases in the future which would increase our operating costs reduce our profit margin and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operation furthermore the rules and regulations of the various card associations and networks prescribe certain capital requirements any increase in the capital level required would further limit our use of capital for other purposes 

interchange fees and related practices have been receiving significant legal and regulatory scrutiny worldwide the resulting regulatory changes that could occur from proposed regulations could alter the fees charged by card associations and debit networks worldwide such changes could have an adverse impact on our business or financial condition due to reductions or changes in types of transactions processed on behalf of our clients see item i business government regulation for more information 

if we fail to comply with applicable regulations or to meet regulatory expectations our business results of operations or financial condition could be adversely impacted 

the majority of our data processing services for financial institutions are not directly subject to federal or state regulations specifically applicable to financial institutions such as banks thrifts and credit unions however as a provider of services to these financial institutions our data processing operations are examined on a regular basis by various federal and state regulatory authorities and by international regulatory authorities such as the fca in certain jurisdictions if we fail to comply with any applicable regulations or guidelines for operations of a data services provider we could be subject to regulatory actions or regulatory rating changes may not meet contractual obligations or suffer harm to our client relationships or reputation failure to meet the aforementioned requirements or to adapt to new requirements at the federal state or international level could inhibit our ability to retain existing clients or obtain new clients which could have an adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition 

in addition to our data processing services described above we also have business operations that store process or transmit consumer information or have direct relationships with consumers that are obligated to comply with regulations including but not limited to the federal fair credit reporting act the federal fair debt collection practices act and applicable privacy requirements further our international businesses must comply with applicable laws such as the us foreign corrupt practices act failure to maintain compliance with or adapt to changes in any of the aforementioned requirements could result in fines penalties or regulatory actions that could have an adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition 

security breaches or attacks or our failure to comply with information security laws or regulations or industry security requirements could harm our business by disrupting our delivery of services and damaging our reputation and could result in a breach of one or more client contracts 

we electronically receive process store and transmit sensitive business information of our clients in addition we collect personal consumer data such as names and addresses social security numbers drivers license numbers cardholder data and payment history records such information is necessary to support our clients transaction processing and to conduct our check authorization and collection businesses the uninterrupted operation of our information systems as well as the confidentiality 

 13 

of the customerconsumer information that resides on such systems is critical to our successful operation if we fail to maintain an adequate security infrastructure adapt to emerging security threats or implement sufficient security standards and technology to protect against security breaches the confidentiality of the information we secure could be compromised unauthorized access to our computer systems or databases could result in the theft or publication of confidential information the deletion or modification of records or could otherwise cause interruptions in our operations these risks are greater with increased information transmission over the internet and the increasing level of sophistication posed by cyber criminals 

our risk management and information security programs are the subject of ongoing review by the federal regulatory agencies with responsibility for oversight of our business in late april 2014 the federal agencies that provide regulatory oversight for fis issued a confidential report related to their examination of our information security risk management and internal audit functions between october 2012 and october 2013 we responded to the report and described the actions that we have taken as well as ongoing efforts underway to address specific findings the regulatory agencies distributed the report and a cover letter to a subset of our regulated clients beginning in may 2014 this prompted inquiries from clients which to the extent permitted by federal regulation fis has addressed on an individual basis we are unable to predict with certainty what if any further communications our regulators will have with our regulated financial institution clients we are also unable to predict the effect that any such communications may have on our business it remains possible that future actions by our regulators or clients related to this matter could have a material adverse impact on our business 

as a provider of services to financial institutions and a provider of card processing services we are bound by the same limitations on disclosure of the information we receive from our clients as apply to the clients themselves if we fail to comply with these regulations and industry security requirements we could be exposed to suits for breach of contract governmental proceedings the imposition of fines or prohibitions on card processing services in addition if more restrictive privacy laws rules or industry security requirements are adopted in the future on the federal or state level or by a specific industry body they could have an adverse impact on us through increased costs or restrictions on business processes any inability to prevent security or privacy breaches or the perception that such breaches may occur could cause our existing clients to lose confidence in our systems and terminate their agreements with us inhibit our ability to attract new clients result in increasing regulation or bring about other adverse consequences from the government agencies that regulate our business 

  

high profile payment card industry or digital banking security breaches could impact consumer payment behavior patterns in the future and reduce our card payment transaction volumes 

   we are unable to predict whether or when high profile card payment or digital banking security breaches will occur and if they occur whether consumers will transact less on their payment cards or reduce their digital banking service if consumers transact less on cards issued by our clients or reduce digital banking services and we are not able to adapt to offer our clients alternative technologies it could have a significant adverse impact on our revenue and related earnings 

misappropriation of our intellectual property and proprietary rights or a finding that our patents are invalid could impair our competitive position 

our ability to compete depends in some part upon our proprietary solutions and technology despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our services or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary or challenge the validity of our patents with governmental authorities policing unauthorized use of our proprietary rights is difficult we cannot make any assurances that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of technology or that the agreements entered into for that purpose will be enforceable effective patent trademark service mark copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our applications and services are made available online misappropriation of our intellectual property or potential litigation concerning such matters could have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 

if our applications or services are found to infringe the proprietary rights of others we may be required to change our business practices and may also become subject to significant costs and monetary penalties 

as our information technology applications and services develop we are increasingly subject to infringement claims any claims whether with or without merit could i be expensive and timeconsuming to defend ii result in an injunction or other equitable relief which could cause us to cease making licensing or using applications that incorporate the challenged intellectual property iii require us to redesign our applications if feasible iv divert management’s attention and resources and v require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements in order to obtain the right to use necessary technologies or pay damages resulting from any infringing use 

we face liability to our merchant clients if checks that we have guaranteed are dishonored by the check writer’s bank 

 14 

if checks that we have guaranteed are dishonored by the check writers banks we must reimburse our merchant clients for the checks face value and pursue collection from the check writers in some cases we recognize a liability to our merchant clients for estimated check returns and a receivable for amounts we estimate we will recover from the check writers based on historical experience and other relevant factors the estimated check returns and recovery amounts are subject to the risk that actual amounts returned may exceed our estimates and actual amounts recovered by us may be less than our estimates changes in economic conditions the risk characteristics and composition of our clients and other factors could impact our actual and projected amounts 

lack of system integrity fraudulent payments credit quality undetected errors related to funds settlement or the availability of clearing services could result in a financial loss 

we settle funds on behalf of financial institutions other businesses and consumers and receive funds from clients card issuers payment networks and consumers on a daily basis for a variety of transaction types transactions facilitated by us include debit card credit card electronic bill payment transactions banking payments and check clearing that supports consumers financial institutions and other businesses these payment activities rely upon the technology infrastructure that facilitates the verification of activity with counterparties the facilitation of the payment as well as the detection or prevention of fraudulent payments if our continuity of operations integrity of processing or ability to detect or prevent fraudulent payments were compromised this could result in a financial loss to us in addition we rely on various financial institutions to provide ach services in support of funds settlement for certain of our products if we are unable to obtain such ach services in the future that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations in addition we may issue credit to consumers financial institutions or other businesses as part of the funds settlement a default on this credit by a counterparty could result in a financial loss to us furthermore if one of our clients for which we facilitate settlement suffers a fraudulent event due to an error of their controls we may suffer a financial loss if the client does not have sufficient capital to cover the loss 

failure to properly manage or mitigate risks in the operation of our wealth management businesses in the us and the uk could have adverse liability consequences   

      we have wealth management businesses in the us and uk engaged in processing securities transactions on behalf of clients and serving as a custodian failure to properly manage or mitigate risks in those operations and increased volatility in the financial markets may increase the potential for and magnitude of resulting losses including those that may arise from human errors or omissions defects or interruptions in computer or communications systems or breakdowns in processes or in internal controls human errors or omissions may include failures to comply with applicable laws or corporate policies and procedures theft fraud or misappropriation of assets whether arising from the intentional actions of internal personnel or external third parties     in addition the us based business holds charters in the states of georgia and delaware which exposes us to further regulatory compliance requirements of the georgia department of banking and finance and the office of the commissioner of banking in the state of delaware the us wealth management business is required to hold certain levels of regulatory capital as defined by the state banking regulators in the states in which they hold a bank or trust charter delaware and georgia in the uk our platform securities business is regulated by the fca and is subject to further regulatory capital requirements 

we have business in emerging markets such as brazil india and southeast asia these emerging markets may experience significant economic volatility in the future which could add volatility to our revenue and earnings 

  in our isg segment we have operations in emerging markets primarily in brazil india and southeast asia these emerging market economies tend to be more volatile than the more established markets we serve in north america and europe which could add volatility to our future revenues and earnings 

our business is subject to the risks of international operations including movements in foreign currency exchange rates 

our international operations represent approximately 22  of total 2014  revenues which are largely conducted in currencies other than the us dollar including the brazilian real british pound euro and indian rupee as a result our financial condition and operating results could be significantly affected by risks associated with international activities including economic and labor conditions political instability tax laws including us taxes on foreign subsidiaries differences in business practices and changes in the value of the us dollar versus local currencies in addition we are less wellknown internationally than in the united states have less experience with local business conditions and may face 

 15 

challenges in successfully managing small operations located far from our headquarters because of the greater difficulty in overseeing and guiding operations from a distance 

as we expand our international operations more of our clients may pay us in foreign currencies conducting business in currencies other than us dollars subjects us to fluctuations in currency exchange rates our primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to foreign currencies in brazil europe australia and parts of asia the us dollar value of our net investments in foreign operations the periodic conversion of foreigndenominated earnings to the us dollar our reporting currency our results of operations and in some cases cash flows could be adversely affected in a material manner by movements in foreign currency exchange rates these risks could cause an adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations 

failure to attract and retain skilled technical employees or senior management personnel could harm our ability to grow 

our future success depends upon our ability to attract and retain highlyskilled technical personnel because the development of our products and services requires knowledge of computer hardware operating system software system management software and application software our technical personnel must be proficient in a number of disciplines competition for such technical personnel is intense and our failure to hire and retain talented personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

our future growth will also require sales and marketing financial and administrative personnel to develop and support new products and services to enhance and support current products and services and to expand operational and financial systems there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain the necessary personnel to accomplish our growth strategies and we may experience constraints that could adversely affect our ability to satisfy client demand in a timely fashion 

our ability to maintain compliance with applicable laws rules and regulations and to manage and monitor the risks facing our business relies upon the ability to maintain skilled compliance security risk and audit professionals competition for such skillsets is intense and our failure to hire and retain talented personnel could have an adverse effect on our internal control environment and impact our operating results 

our senior management team has significant experience in the financial services industry either at fis or with clients or competitors and the loss of this leadership could have an adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition further the loss of this leadership may have an adverse impact on senior managements ability to provide effective oversight and strategic direction for all key functions within the company which could impact our future business operating results and financial condition 

       we are the subject of various legal proceedings that could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability   

       we are involved in various litigation matters including in some cases classaction and patent infringement litigation if we are unsuccessful in our defense in the litigation matters we may be forced to pay damages andor change our business practices any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

 unfavorable resolution of tax contingencies or unfavorable future tax law changes could adversely affect our tax expense 

our tax returns and positions are subject to review and audit by federal state local and international taxing authorities an unfavorable outcome to a tax audit could result in higher tax expense and could negatively impact our effective tax rate financial position results of operations and cash flows in the current andor future periods unfavorable future tax law changes could also result in these negative impacts 

     risks related to business combinations and ventures 

we have a substantial investment in our brazilian venture and obtain significant revenue through that venture that would be lost and result in significant termination costs if our venture partner were to terminate the agreement 

        revenue attributable to our brazilian venture partner banco bradesco accounted for 2774 million  in 2014  the contract that we have with our brazilian venture partner allows for the termination or partial termination of the contract at any point during the 10year term which ends september 30 2020 this risk of contract termination is reduced by guaranteed performance targets and minimum payments that would be triggered upon the event of an early termination these payments 

 16 

have been established based on fis expected rate of return for the contract over a 10year period the required payments and buyouts decline each year and are further reduced by returns in excess of the expected returns for the contract and reduce the overall barrier to exiting the venture if our partner were to exit the agreement this could have a significant impact on our future revenue and growth for further detail on our brazilian venture see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements 

    additionally we employ approximately 10000 employees in brazil who would have the ability to file labor claims if their employment is terminated if our brazilian venture partner were to terminate the agreement we and they may be subject to labor claims filed by employees of the brazilian venture these claims if realized could result in a significant cost and impact to our earnings 

        we have substantial investments in recorded goodwill and other intangible assets as a result of prior acquisitions and a severe or extended economic downturn could cause these investments to become impaired requiring writedowns that would reduce our operating income 

as of december 31 2014  goodwill aggregated to 88776 million  or 611  of total assets and other indefinite lived intangible assets aggregated to 823 million  or 06  of total assets current accounting rules require goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets to be assessed for impairment at least annually or whenever changes in circumstances indicate potential impairment factors that may be considered a change in circumstance include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results a significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization and negative industry or economic trends the results of our 2014  annual assessment of the recoverability of goodwill indicated that the fair values of the company’s reporting units were in excess of the carrying values of those reporting units and thus no goodwill impairment existed as of december 31 2014  likewise the fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets was also in excess of the carrying value of those assets as of december 31 2014 however if worldwide or united states economic conditions decline significantly with negative impacts to bank spending and consumer behavior  or if other business or market changes impact our outlook  the carrying amount of our goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets may no longer be recoverable and we may be required to record an impairment charge which would have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

as of december 31 2014  intangible assets with finite useful lives aggregated to 11857 million  or 82  of total assets current accounting rules require intangible assets with finite useful lives to be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable factors that may be considered a change in circumstance include significant under performance relative to historical or projected future operating results a significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization and negative industry or economic trends 

we will continue to monitor the fair value of our intangible assets as well as our market capitalization and the impact of any economic downturn on our business to determine if there is an impairment in future periods 

risks related to our indebtedness 

losses consolidations and failures in the financial services industry may impact our ability to borrow funds or the ability of our lenders to fulfill their obligations under our interest rate swap agreements 

some financial institutions continue to be challenged by negative operating results in certain cases these negative operating results have led to financial institution failures andor consolidations as a result lenders may become insolvent which could in turn make it more difficult or impossible for lenders to perform their obligations under our interest rate swap agreements or for us to borrow under our revolving loan obtain financing on favorable terms or obtain financing or interest rate swap agreements at all our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if a financial institution fails to fulfill its obligations under our interest rate swap agreements or we are unable to draw funds under our revolving loan or obtain other costeffective financing 

our existing debt levels and future levels under existing facilities and debt service requirements may adversely affect our financial condition or operational flexibility and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our outstanding indebtedness 

as of december 31 2014  we had total debt of approximately 50677 million  this level of debt could have adverse consequences for our business financial condition operating results and operational flexibility including the following i the debt level may cause us to have difficulty borrowing money in the future for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions or other purposes ii our debt level may limit operational flexibility and our ability to pursue business opportunities and 

 17 

implement certain business strategies iii some of our debt has a variable rate of interest which exposes us to the risk of increased interest rates iv we have a higher level of debt than some of our competitors or potential competitors which may cause a competitive disadvantage and may reduce flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions including increased competition and vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  v there are significant maturities on our debt that we may not be able to fulfill or that may be refinanced at higher rates and vi  if we fail to satisfy our obligations under our outstanding debt or fail to comply with the financial or other restrictive covenants contained in the indenture governing our senior notes or our credit facility an event of default could result that could cause all of our debt to become due and payable 

the covenants relating to our notes and the fis credit agreement are limited and do not prohibit us from incurring additional debt or taking other actions that could exacerbate the risks described in the preceding risk factor or otherwise negatively impact holders of our notes 

we may be able to incur substantially more debt in the future although the indenture governing certain of our notes and the agreements governing the fis credit agreement as both are defined in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements each contain restrictions on our incurrence of additional indebtedness these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions and under certain circumstances indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial as of december 31 2014  we had approximately 22042 million  of borrowing capacity available under our existing fis credit agreement to the extent new debt is added to our current levels the risks described above could substantially increase

overview 

 fis is a leading global provider of banking and payments technology solutions and consulting and outsourcing solutions with a long history deeply rooted in the financial services industry and banking and payment technology solutions fis delivers services to more than 14000 institutions in over 100 countries headquartered in jacksonville florida fis employs approximately 40000 people worldwide and holds leadership positions in payment processing and banking solutions providing software services and outsourcing of the technology that drives financial institutions through our capco brand we deliver globally a wide range of information technology consulting and transformational services to financial institutions fis is a member of the fortune 500 us and of standard and poors sp 500 index 

business trends and conditions 

our revenue is primarily derived from a combination of recurring technology and processing services consulting and professional services and software license fees the majority of our revenue has historically been recurring provided under multiyear contracts that contribute relative stability to our revenue stream these services in general are considered critical to our clients operations a significant portion of these recurring revenues is derived from transaction processing fees that fluctuate with the level of deposit accounts and card transactions associated with consumer and commercial activity consulting and professional services revenues are typically nonrecurring and sales of software licenses are less predictable a portion of which can be regarded as discretionary spending by our clients 

a continued trend in the financial services industry from which we are benefiting is the migration by many financial institutions to outsourced integrated technology solutions to improve their profitability and rapidly address regulatory challenges as a provider of outsourcing solutions we benefit from multiyear recurring revenue streams which help moderate the effects of yeartoyear economic changes on our results of operations we believe our integrated solutions and outsourced services are targeted and well positioned to address this outsourcing trend across the markets we serve 

  

consulting services revenue grew at an increased pace in 2014   and we believe this trend will continue in 2015 the current market pressures in the financial services industry are driving demand for our consulting and professional services as many financial institutions seek to transform their businesses to significantly reduce their cost base innovate and comply with increased regulatory oversight with regard to information technology and related processes capco provides strategic consulting service capabilities to respond to these market needs and has established itself as a leading global consultancy focused on transformation strategy and execution our gross margin percentage will decline if consulting and professional services revenue grows disproportionately to our processing and service revenue which generally delivers a higher gross margin in addition as consulting and professional services revenue grow as a portion of our overall revenue we likely will have a lower overall percentage of recurring revenue as these services are generally nonrecurring 

in 2014 we targeted a market opportunity in large global financial institutions where we coupled our strategic consulting and transformation services with outsourced technology services and solutions to help them achieve their business goals we made significant incremental investments in management sales and account management resources in 2014 to address this opportunity we believe this market opportunity remains attractive as these large institutions address the challenges they face thereby driving demand for our consulting and professional services additionally we believe these large global institutions are likely to increase technology spending to meet competitive pressures after a slowdown during the recent financial crisis years we expect to sustain our 2014 investment in management sales and account management resources to pursue this market opportunity 

  

consumer preference continues to shift from traditional branch banking services to faster ondemand banking solutions and our clients seek to provide a single integrated banking experience through their branch mobile internet and voice banking channels we are focused on enabling our clients to deliver this experience to their customers through our integrated solutions 

 25 

and services we continue to innovate and invest in these integrated solutions and services to assist clients as they address this market demand 

  

we continue to see demand for innovative solutions in the payments market that will deliver faster more convenient payment solutions in mobile channels internet applications and cards we believe mobile payments will grow and partially replace existing payment tender volumes over time as consumers and merchants embrace the convenience incremental services and benefits mobile payment volume is growing significantly but does not yet represent a meaningful amount of the payments market additionally new formidable nontraditional payments competitors such as apple paypal and large merchants are investing in and innovating mobile payment technologies to address the emerging market opportunity and it is unclear the extent to which particular technologies or services will succeed we believe the growth of mobile payments continues to present both an opportunity and a risk to us as the market develops although we cannot predict which mobile payment technologies or solution will be successful we cautiously believe our client relationships payments infrastructure and experience adapted solutions and emerging solutions are well positioned to maintain or grow our clients existing payment volumes which is our focus 

high profile north american merchant payment card information security breaches have pushed the payment card industry towards emv integrated circuit cards as financial institutions card networks and merchants seek to improve information security and reduce fraud costs we have invested in our card management solutions and card manufacturing and processing capabilities to accommodate emv integrated circuit cards so we can guide our clients through this anticipated technology transition sustain and grow our card driven businesses we believe the trend to migrate to emv cards will accelerate in 2015 and we continue to invest to address market demand 

the use of checks continues to decline as a percentage of total payments which negatively impacts our check warranty and itemprocessing businesses and we expect this trend to continue in 2014 we observed a modest deceleration in our check volume decline and to date have been able to successfully mitigate the majority of the impacts of this decline through cost and fraud efficiency actions and new market solutions which remain our continued focus 

we anticipate consolidation within the banking industry will continue primarily in the form of merger and acquisition activity which we believe as a whole is detrimental to our business however consolidation resulting from specific merger and acquisition transactions may be beneficial or detrimental to our business when consolidations of financial institutions occur merger partners often operate systems licensed from competing service providers the newly formed entity generally makes a determination to migrate its core and payments systems to a single platform when a financial institution processing client is involved in a consolidation we may benefit by their expanding the use of our services if such services are chosen to survive the consolidation and support the newly combined entity conversely we may lose market share if we are providing services to both entities or we are not the merging parties provider of core or payment processing or if a client of ours is involved in a consolidation and our services are not chosen to survive the consolidation and support the newly combined entity it is also possible that larger financial institutions resulting from consolidation may have greater leverage in negotiating terms or could decide to perform inhouse some or all of the services that we currently provide or could provide we seek to mitigate the risks of consolidations by offering other competitive services to take advantage of specific opportunities at the surviving company 

notwithstanding challenging global economic conditions our international business continued to experience growth across all major regions on a constant currency basis during the year ended december 31 2014 including latin america europe and asia we expect this growth trend to continue as the result of continued growth in our consulting and professional services new largescale outsourcing clients and the opportunities we see for similar arrangements demand for our solutions will also be driven in developing countries by governmentled financial inclusion policies aimed to reduce the unbanked population and by growth in the middle classes in these markets driving the need for more sophisticated banking solutions the majority of our european revenue is generated by clients in the united kingdom france and germany 

  

information security 

globally attacks on information technology systems continue to grow in frequency complexity and sophistication this is a trend we expect will continue such attacks have become a point of focus for individuals businesses and governmental entities the objectives of these attacks include among other things gaining unauthorized access to systems to facilitate financial fraud disrupt operations cause denial of service events corrupt data and steal nonpublic information fis is not immune to such attacks as part of our business we electronically receive process store and transmit a wide range of confidential information including sensitive customer information and personal consumer data we also operate payment cash access and prepaid card systems fis like any large financial technology service provider is subject to attempted cyberattacks on a regular basis a successful cyberattack on an fis system that resulted in sensitive information being compromised fraud losses or other adverse consequences could have a material adverse effect on the company 

 26 

as a multiregional data processing servicer mdps fis continues to be examined by and have regular interaction with the federal agencies that regulate financial institutions these regulators have the authority to take actions they deem necessary to protect the safety and soundness of the financial institutions they regulate such actions if taken could have a material adverse impact on our business fis regularly reports to its regulators and to its clients regarding the companys continual efforts to enhance its information security and risk management technology programs and procedures in late april 2014 the federal agencies that provide regulatory oversight for fis issued a confidential report related to their examination of our information security risk management and internal audit functions between october 2012 and october 2013 we responded to the report and described the actions that we have taken as well as ongoing efforts underway to address specific findings the regulatory agencies distributed the report and a cover letter to a subset of our regulated clients beginning in may 2014 this prompted inquiries from clients which to the extent permitted by federal regulation fis has addressed on an individual basis while individual clients and prospects have expressed concern over the report we do not believe that it has had a material effect on the overall sales closures in 2014 or our sales pipeline however we continue to monitor sales activity and any potential impact on future periods we are unable to predict with certainty what if any communications or actions our regulators will have or take with our regulated financial institution clients with respect to our risk management and information security we are also unable to predict the effect that any such communications or actions may have on our business 

fis remains focused on making strategic investments in information security to protect its clients and its information systems this includes both capital expenditures and operating expense on hardware software personnel and consulting services we also participate in industry and governmental initiatives to improve information security for our clients 

critical accounting policies 

the accounting policies described below are those we consider critical in preparing our consolidated financial statements these policies require management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures with respect to contingent liabilities and assets at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods actual amounts could differ from those estimates see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed description of the significant accounting policies that have been followed in preparing our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

the company generates revenues from the delivery of bank processing credit and debit card processing services other payment processing services professional services software licensing and software related services revenues are recognized when evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred fees are fixed or determinable and collection is considered probable we are frequently a party to multiple concurrent contracts with the same client these situations require judgment to determine whether the individual contracts should be aggregated or evaluated separately for purposes of revenue recognition in making this determination we consider the timing of negotiating and executing the contracts whether the different elements of the contracts are interdependent and whether any of the payment terms of the contracts are interrelated our individual contracts also frequently include multiple elements we must apply judgment in these circumstances in determining whether individual elements can be considered separate units of accounting or should instead be accounted for in combination with other deliverables judgment is also required in ascribing fair value to each deliverable for purposes of allocating consideration due to the large number broad nature and average size of individual contracts we are party to the impact of judgments and assumptions that we apply in recognizing revenue for any single contract is not likely to have a material effect on our consolidated operations or financial position however the broader accounting policy assumptions that we apply across similar arrangements or classes of clients could significantly influence the timing and amount of revenue recognized in our historical and future results of operations or financial position additional information about our revenue recognition policies is included in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

the company analyzes trade accounts receivable by considering historical bad debts client creditworthiness current economic trends changes in client payment terms and collection trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts any change in the assumptions used may result in an additional allowance for doubtful accounts being recognized in the period in which the change occurs 

 27 

provision for check guarantee losses 

in our check guarantee business if a guaranteed check presented to a merchant client is dishonored by the check writer’s bank we reimburse our merchant client for the check’s face value and pursue collection of the amount from the delinquent check writer loss provisions and anticipated recoveries are primarily determined by performing a historical analysis of our check loss and recovery experience and considering other factors that could affect that experience in the future such factors include the general economy the overall industry mix of our client volumes statistical analysis of check fraud trends within our client volumes and the quality of returned checks the estimated check returns and recovery amounts are subject to the risk that actual amounts returned and recovered may be different than our estimates 

historically our estimation processes have proved to be materially accurate however our projections of probable check guarantee losses and anticipated recoveries are inherently uncertain and as a result we cannot predict with certainty the amount of such items changes in economic conditions the risk characteristics and composition of our clients and other factors could impact our actual and projected amounts we recorded check guarantee losses net of anticipated recoveries excluding service fees of 572 million  573 million  and 547 million  respectively for the years ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  a ten percent difference in our estimated check guarantee loss provisions net of estimated recoveries as of december 31 2014  would have impacted 2014 net earnings by less than 20 million aftertax 

computer software 

computer software includes the fair value of software acquired in business combinations purchased software and capitalized software development costs purchased software is recorded at cost and amortized using the straightline method over its estimated useful life and software acquired in business combinations is recorded at its fair value and amortized using straightline or accelerated methods over its estimated useful life 

the capitalization of software development costs is governed by fasb asc subtopic 98520 if the software is to be sold leased or otherwise marketed or by fasb asc subtopic 35040 if the software is for internal use after the technological feasibility of the software has been established for software to be marketed or at the beginning of application development for internaluse software software development costs which include primarily salaries and related payroll costs and costs of independent contractors incurred during development are capitalized research and development costs incurred prior to the establishment of technological feasibility for software to be marketed or prior to application development for internaluse software are expensed as incurred software development costs are amortized on a productbyproduct basis commencing on the date of general release of the products for software to be marketed or the date placed in service for internaluse software software development costs for software to be marketed are amortized using the greater of 1 the straightline method over its estimated useful life which ranges from three to 10 years or 2 the ratio of current revenues to total anticipated revenues over its useful life 

in determining useful lives management considers historical results and technological trends that may influence the estimate useful lives for all computer software range from three to 10 years we also assess the recorded value of computer software for impairment on a regular basis by comparing the carrying value to the estimated future cash flows to be generated by the underlying software asset for software to be marketed there are inherent uncertainties in determining the expected useful life or cash flows to be generated from computer software while we have not historically experienced significant changes in these estimates our results of operations could be subject to such changes in the future 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

we are required to allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction at their estimated fair values the estimates used to determine the fair value of longlived assets such as intangible assets are complex and require a significant amount of management judgment we generally engage independent valuation specialists to assist us in making fair value determinations we are also required to estimate the useful lives of intangible assets to determine the amount of acquisitionrelated intangible asset amortization expense to record in future periods we periodically review the estimated useful lives assigned to our finitelived intangible assets to determine whether such estimated useful lives continue to be appropriate additionally we review our indefinitelived intangible assets to determine if there is any change in circumstances that may indicate the asset’s useful life is no longer indefinite 

goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives should not be amortized but shall be tested for impairment annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate potential impairment in 2011 the fasb issued accounting standards update no 201108 asu 201108 testing goodwill for impairment the revised standard allows an entity first 

 28 

to assess qualitatively whether it is more likely than not that a reporting units carrying amount exceeds its fair value referred to in the guidance as step zero if an entity concludes that it is more likely than not that a reporting units fair value is less than its carrying amount that is a likelihood of more than 50 percent the step one quantitative assessment must be performed for that reporting unit asu 201108 provided examples of events and circumstances that should be considered in performing the step zero qualitative assessment including macroeconomic conditions industry and market considerations cost factors overall financial performance events affecting a reporting unit or the entity as a whole and a sustained decrease in share price   

  we assess goodwill for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter using a september 30th measurement date unless circumstances require a more frequent measurement for 2014 and 2013 we began our assessment with the step zero qualitative analysis because there was a substantial excess of fair value over carrying value for each of our reporting units in the 2012 step one analysis in performing the step zero qualitative analysis for each of 2014 and 2013 examining those factors most likely to affect our valuations we concluded that it remained more likely than not that the fair value of each of our reporting units continued to exceed their carrying amounts consequently we did not perform a step one quantitative analysis in 2014 or 2013 

for 2012 primarily for the purpose of validating our valuation assumptions we elected to proceed directly to the step one quantitative analysis rather than perform the step zero qualitative assessment in applying the quantitative analysis we determine the fair value of our reporting units based on a weighted average of multiple valuation techniques principally a combination of an income approach and a market approach the income approach calculates a value based upon the present value of estimated future cash flows while the market approach uses earnings multiples of similarly situated guideline public companies if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the reporting unit’s net assets goodwill is not impaired and further testing is not required based upon the results of this test there were no indications of impairment for any of our reporting units for 2012 

we also estimate the fair value of acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives and compare this amount to the underlying carrying value annually fasb accounting standards update no 201202 asu 201202 modified the former requirement to perform an annual quantitative impairment test for indefinitelived intangible assets similar to the asu 201108 guidance for goodwill it allows an organization to first perform a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that an asset has been impaired 

 for 2014 and 2013 we began our assessment of indefinite lived intangibles with the step zero qualitative analysis because there was a substantial excess of fair value over carrying value for each of our indefinitelived intangible assets in 2012 based upon the results of this test there were no indications of impairment except for one trademark with nominal value in 2013 for 2012 we proceeded directly to a quantitative analysis using a form of income approach valuation known as the relieffromroyalty method our tests did not result in the impairment of any of our intangible assets for 2012 

determining the fair value of a reporting unit or acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives involves judgment and the use of significant estimates and assumptions which include assumptions regarding the revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate estimated future cash flows riskadjusted discount rates and future economic and market conditions and other assumptions 

accounting for income taxes 

as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements we are required to determine income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate this process involves estimating actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing recognition of items for income tax and financial reporting purposes these differences result in deferred income tax assets and liabilities which are included within the consolidated balance sheets we must then assess the likelihood that deferred income tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely establish a valuation allowance to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase or decrease this allowance in a period we must reflect this increase or decrease as an expense or benefit within income tax expense in the consolidated statements of earnings determination of the income tax expense requires estimates and can involve complex issues that may require an extended period to resolve further changes in the geographic mix of revenues or in the estimated level of annual pretax income can cause the overall effective income tax rate to vary from period to period we also receive periodic assessments from taxing authorities challenging our positions that must be taken into consideration in determining our tax reserves resolving these assessments which may or may not result in additional taxes due may also require an extended period of time we believe that our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that we adequately account for any known tax contingencies we believe the estimates and assumptions used to support our evaluation of tax benefit realization are reasonable however final determination of prioryear tax liabilities either by settlement with tax authorities or expiration of statutes of limitations could be materially different than estimates reflected in assets and liabilities 

 29 

and historical income tax provisions the outcome of these final determinations could have a material effect on our income tax provision net income or cash flows in the period that a determination is made

processing and services revenues 

processing and services revenues totaled 64138 million  60634 million  and 57958 million  in 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively the increase in revenue during 2014  of 3504 million  or 58  as compared to 2013  is primarily attributable to increased demand for implementation and consulting services incremental revenues from 2013 and 2014 acquisitions of 832 million and growth from our international operations resulting from our expanded presence across europe and asia the 2014  period included 374 million of unfavorable foreign currency impact resulting from a stronger us dollar as compared to 2013  the increase in revenue during 2013  of 2676 million  or 46  as compared to 2012  is primarily attributable to transaction growth and demand for professional and consulting services higher termination fees incremental revenues from 2013  and 2012  acquisitions of 557 million and increased processing volumes the 2013  period included 496 million of unfavorable foreign currency impact resulting from a stronger us dollar as compared to 2012

cost of revenues and gross profit 

cost of revenues totaled 43327 million  40927 million  and 39562 million  in 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively resulting in gross profit of 20811 million  19707 million  and 18396 million  in 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively gross profit as a percentage of revenues “gross margin” was 324  325  and 317  in 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively the increase in gross profit during 2014  as compared to 2013  primarily resulted from the revenue variances discussed above the gross margin for 2014  as compared to 2013  primarily reflects the impact of revenue mix as higher margin processing revenue drove margin expansion that was offset by an increase in lower margin consulting revenue and lower termination fees in 2014  the increase in gross profit during 2013  as compared to 2012  primarily resulted from the revenue variances discussed above the increase in gross margin for 2013  as compared to 2012  primarily reflects the impact of a more favorable revenue mix as higher margin processing revenue and termination fees drove margin expansion that was partially offset by increases in lower margin consulting revenue and 161 million of the capco acquisition related adjustments described in note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements

selling general and administrative expenses totaled 8105 million  9078 million  and 7633 million  for 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively the 2014  decrease of 973 million  as compared to 2013  was primarily due to the impact of charges recorded in the 2013 period discussed below partially offset by 2014 onetime transaction costs including integration activities related to recent acquisitions and other severance costs the 2013  increase of 1445 million  as compared to 2012  was primarily due to charges of 1311 million for the capco acquisition related adjustments described in note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements the 2013  period also included higher sales and marketing expense an increase in healthcare benefit expense and increased investment in security and risk management 

operating income 

operating income totaled 12706 million  10629 million  and 10763 million  for 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively   operating income as a percentage of revenue “operating margin” was 198  175  and 186  for 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively the annual changes in operating income and operating margin resulted from the revenue and cost variances addressed above 

total other income expense 

total other income expense was 2172 million  2394 million  and 2480 million  for 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively interest expense is a large component of total other income expense net interest expense totaled 1728 million  1986 million  and 2313 million  for 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively the decrease of 258 million  in interest expense in 2014  as compared to 2013  is primarily due to lower borrowing rates as the result of the debt refinancing activity undertaken during 2014  and 2013  other income expense net for 2014 includes a loss of 162 on a foreign currency forward contract associated with the eurobased purchase price for our clear2pay acquisition the writeoff of certain previously capitalized debt issuance costs of 70 million and the payment of a 295 million bond premium associated with the early redemption of certain debt the decrease of 327 million  in interest expense in 2013  as compared to 2012  resulted from lower borrowing rates as the result of debt refinancing in addition to interest expense the 2013 period also includes a charges of 161 million for the writeoff of certain previously capitalized debt issuance costs and transaction expenses related to refinancing activities b a net charge of 453 million representing the 516 million premium incurred for the early redemption of certain debt offset by the premium reflected in the carrying value of that debt and c a 92 million gain resulting from the purchase of the remaining shares of mfoundry representing the difference between the fair value and carrying value of the minorityinterest investment previously held 

provision for income taxes 

income tax expense from continuing operations totaled 3351 million  3089 million  and 2701 million  for 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively this resulted in an effective tax rate on continuing operations of 318  375  and 326  for 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively during 2014 we realized tax benefits related to certain acquired net operating loss carryovers this and certain favorable audit resolutions in 2014 contributed to the rate differential for the 2014 period in 2013 capco acquisition related contingent consideration that was recorded in 2013 was not deductible for tax purposes and therefore had an unfavorable impact on the 2013 effective tax rate which otherwise would have been comparable to 2012

earnings loss from discontinued operations 

during 2014  2013  and 2012  certain operations are classified as discontinued as discussed in note 3 of the notes to consolidated financial statements reporting for discontinued operations classifies revenues and expenses as one line item net of tax in the consolidated statements of earnings the table below outlines the components of discontinued operations for 2014  2013  and 2012  net of tax in millions 



during the second quarter of 2014 the company committed to a plan to sell our business operation that provides ecas core banking software solutions to small financial institutions in china because it did not align with our strategic plans this line of business was previously included in the isg segment 

on january 1 2010 fis sold certain assets and liabilities constituting our clearpar automated syndicated loan trade settlement business terms of the sale included an initial cash payment of 715 million  at closing with the potential for an additional contingent earnout payment calculated as a function of the business 2012 operating results in may 2013 we recorded in discontinued operations a gain of 268 million   167 million  net of tax upon final determination and receipt of the earnout payment 

participacoes our former item processing and remittance services business in brazil had no revenue in 2014  2013  and 2012  participacoes had expenses of 101 million  231 million  and 475 million  for 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively participacoes processing volume was transitioned to other vendors or back to its clients during the second quarter of 2011 as a result of the dismissal of employees related to the shutdown activities completed in 2011 the 2014  2013  and 2012  periods included charges of 51 million  157 million  and 391 million  respectively to settle claims or increase our provision for potential labor claims the shutdown activities involved the transfer and termination of approximately 2600 employees as of december 31 2014  there are approximately 790  active labor claims former employees generally had up to two years from the date of termination to file labor claims consequently we have continued exposure on these active claims which were not transferred with other assets and liabilities in the disposal any changes in the estimated liability related to these labor claims will be recorded as discontinued operations 

in 2004 proservvi empreendimentos e servicios ltda the predecessor to fidelity national servicos de tratamento de documentos e informatica ltda “servicos” a subsidiary of participacoes acquired certain assets and employees and leased certain facilities from the transpev group “transpev” in brazil transpev’s remaining assets were later acquired by prosegur an unrelated third party when transpev discontinued its operations after the asset sale to prosegur it had unpaid federal taxes and social contributions owing to the brazilian tax authorities the brazilian tax authorities brought a claim against transpev and beginning in 2012 brought claims against prosegur and servicos on the grounds that that prosegur and servicos were successors in interest to transpev 

to date the brazilian tax authorities filed four claims against servicos asserting potential tax liabilities of approximately 80 million there are potentially 26 additional claims against prosegur for which servicos is named as a codefendant or may be named but for which servicos has not yet been served these additional claims amount to approximately 600 million making the total potential exposure for all 30 claims approximately 680 million while a liability for these 30 total claims is possible we do not believe it is probable or reasonably estimable and therefore have not accrued for any of these claims 

net earnings loss attributable to noncontrolling interest 

net earnings loss attributable to noncontrolling interest predominantly relates to the joint venture in brazil see note 5 of notes to consolidated financial statements and totaled 278 million  246 million  and 199 million  for 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively

liquidity and capital resources 

cash requirements 

our ongoing cash requirements include operating expenses income taxes mandatory debt service payments capital expenditures stockholder dividends working capital and timing differences in settlementrelated assets and liabilities and may include discretionary debt service share repurchases and business acquisitions our cash requirements also include payments for capcos contingent consideration earnout and for labor claims related to fis former item processing and remittance operations in brazil see notes 6 and 3 respectively in the notes to consolidated financial statements our principal sources of funds are cash generated by operations and borrowings including the capacity under our revolving loan described in note 13 in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

as of december 31 2014  we had cash and cash equivalents of 4928 million  and debt of 50677 million  including the current portion of the 4928 million  cash and cash equivalents approximately 3105 million  is held by our foreign entities and would generally be subject to us income taxation upon repatriation to the us the majority of our domestic cash and cash equivalents represents net depositsintransit at the balance sheet dates and relates to daily settlement activity we expect that cash and cash equivalents plus cash flows from operations over the next twelve months will be sufficient to fund our operating cash requirements capital expenditures and mandatory debt service

201409” asu 201409 amends substantially all authoritative literature for revenue recognition including industryspecific 

requirements and converges the guidance under this topic with that of the international financial reporting standards the 

asu implements a fivestep process for customer contract revenue recognition that focuses on transfer of control as opposed 

to transfer of risk and rewards the amendment also requires enhanced disclosures regarding the nature amount timing and 

uncertainty of revenues and cash flows from contracts with customers other provisions include ensuring the time value of 

money is considered in the transaction price and allowing estimates of variable consideration to be recognized before 

contingencies are resolved in certain circumstances the amendments in this asu are effective for reporting periods beginning 

after december 15 2016 and early adoption is prohibited entities can transition to the standard either with retrospective 

application to the earlier years presented in their financial statements or with a cumulativeeffect adjustment as of the date of

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risks 

tableend 

  market risk 

we are exposed to market risks primarily from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates we use certain derivative financial instruments including interest rate swaps and foreign currency forward contracts to manage interest rate and foreign currency risk we do not use derivatives for trading purposes to generate income or to engage in speculative activity 

interest rate risk 

in addition to existing cash balances and cash provided by operating activities we use fixed rate and variable rate debt to finance our operations we are exposed to interest rate risk on these debt obligations and related interest rate swaps 

the senior notes as described in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements represent substantially all of our fixedrate longterm debt obligations the carrying value of the notes was 29500 million  as of december 31 2014  the fair value of the senior notes was approximately 30125 million  as of december 31 2014  the potential reduction in fair value of the senior notes from a hypothetical 10  percent increase in market interest rates would not be material to the overall fair value of the debt 

our floating rate longterm debt obligations principally relate to borrowings under the fis credit agreement as defined in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements an increase of 100 basis points in the libor rate would increase our annual debt service under the fis credit agreement after we include the impact of our interest rate swaps by 143 million  based on principal amounts outstanding as of december 31 2014  we performed the foregoing sensitivity analysis based on the principal amount of our floating rate debt as of december 31 2014  less the principal amount of such debt that was then subject to an interest rate swap converting such debt into fixed rate debt this sensitivity analysis is based solely on the principal amount of such debt as of december 31 2014  and does not take into account any changes that occurred in the prior 12 months or that may take place in the next 12 months in the amount of our outstanding debt or in the notional amount of outstanding interest rate swaps in respect of our debt further in this sensitivity analysis the change in interest rates is assumed to be applicable for an entire year for comparison purposes based on principal amounts of floating rate debt outstanding as of 

 37 

december 31 2013  and calculated in the same manner as set forth above an increase of 100 basis points in the libor rate would have increased our annual interest expense after we calculate the impact of our interest rate swaps by 73 million  

we use interest rate swaps for the purpose of managing our interest expense through the mix of fixed rate and floating rate debt during the year ended december 31 2014  the notional amount of our outstanding interest rate swaps decreased by 10000 million  as of december 31 2014  we have entered into the following interest rate swap transactions converting a portion of the interest rate exposure on our term and revolving loans from variable to fixed in millions 



 

 we have designated these interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes a portion of the amount included in accumulated other comprehensive earnings is reclassified into interest expense as a yield adjustment as interest payments are made on the term and revolving loans in accordance with the authoritative guidance for fair value measurements the inputs used to determine the estimated fair value of our interest rate swaps are level 2type measurements we considered our own credit risk and the credit risk of the counterparties when determining the fair value of our interest rate swaps 

foreign currency risk 

we are exposed to foreign currency risks that arise from normal business operations these risks include the translation of local currency balances of foreign subsidiaries transaction gains and losses associated with intercompany loans with foreign subsidiaries and transactions denominated in currencies other than a locations functional currency our objective is to minimize our exposure to these risks through a combination of normal operating activities and the use of foreign currency forward contracts contracts are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries 

our exposure to foreign currency exchange risks generally arises from our nonus operations to the extent they are conducted in local currency changes in foreign currency exchange rates affect translations of revenues denominated in currencies other than the us dollar our international operations generated approximately 14173 million  12666 million  and 11687 million  in revenues during the years ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  of which approximately 12285 million  10868 million  and 10092 million  respectively was denominated in currencies other than the us dollar the major currencies to which our revenues are exposed are the brazilian real the euro the british pound sterling and the indian rupee a 10 move in average exchange rates for these currencies assuming a simultaneous and immediate 10 change in all of such rates for the relevant period would have resulted in the following increase or decrease in our reported revenues for the years ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  in millions 



the impact on earnings of the foregoing assumed 10 change in each of the periods presented would not have been significant our international operations revenues and expenses are generally denominated in local currency which limits the majority of our economic exposure to foreign exchange risk in those jurisdictions 

  

 38 

revenues included 374 million  and 496 million  and operating income included 89 million  and 119 million  respectively of unfavorable foreign currency impact during 2014  and 2013  resulting from a stronger us dollar during these years compared to the preceding year in 2015 we expect a moderate increase in unfavorable foreign currency impact on our operating income resulting from the continued strengthening of us dollar vs other currencies 

our foreign exchange risk management policy permits the use of derivative instruments such as forward contracts and options to reduce volatility in our results of operations andor cash flows resulting from foreign exchange rate fluctuations we do not enter into foreign currency derivative instruments for trading purposes we do periodically enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency exposure to intercompany loans as of december 31 2014  the notional amount of these derivatives was approximately 854 million  and the fair value was nominal these derivatives are intended to hedge the foreign exchange risks related to intercompany loans but have not been designated as hedges for accounting purposes 

       in conjunction with entering into the definitive agreement to acquire clear2pay in september 2014 we initiated a foreign currency forward contract to purchase euros and sell us dollars to manage the risk arising from fluctuations in exchange rates until the closing because the purchase price was stated in euros as this derivative did not qualify for hedge accounting we recorded a charge of 162 million  in other income expense net during the third quarter of 2014 this forward contract was settled on october 1 2014

research and development 

our research and development activities have related primarily to the design and development of processing systems and related software applications and risk management platforms we expect to continue our practice of investing an appropriate level of resources to maintain enhance and extend the functionality of our proprietary systems and existing software applications to develop new and innovative software applications and systems to address emerging technology trends in response to the needs of our customers and to enhance the capabilities surrounding our outsourcing infrastructure in addition we intend to offer services that are compatible with new and emerging delivery channels 

as part of our research and development process we evaluate current and emerging technology for compatibility with our existing and future software platforms to this end we engage with various hardware and software vendors in evaluation of various infrastructure components where appropriate we use thirdparty technology components in the development of our software applications and service offerings in the case of nearly all of our thirdparty software enterprise license agreements exist for the thirdparty component and either alternative suppliers exist or transfer rights exist to ensure the continuity of supply as a result we are not materially dependent upon any thirdparty technology components thirdparty software may be used for highly specialized business functions which we may not be able to develop internally within time and budget constraints additionally thirdparty software may be used for commoditytype functions within a technology platform environment we work with our customers to determine the appropriate timing and approach to introducing technology or infrastructure changes to our applications and services in each of the years ended december 31 2013  2012  and 2011  approximately 2 to 3 of revenues were invested in research and development efforts 

government regulation 

our services are subject to a broad range of complex federal state and foreign regulation including federal truthinlending and truthinsavings rules regulation aa unfair or deceptive acts or practices privacy laws usury laws the equal credit opportunity act the electronic funds transfer act the fair credit reporting act the fair debt collection practices act the bank secrecy act the usa patriot act the internal revenue code the employee retirement income security act the health insurance portability and accountability act the community reinvestment act and the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the doddfrank act the compliance of our services and applications with these and other applicable laws and regulations depends on a variety of factors including the manner in which our clients use them our clients are contractually responsible for determining what is required of them under applicable laws and regulations so that we can 

 7 

assist them in their compliance efforts the failure of our services to comply with applicable laws and regulations could result in restrictions on our ability to provide them as well as the imposition of civil fines andor criminal penalties the principal areas of regulation impacting our business are 

 

 

 

the doddfrank act was enacted and signed into law on july 21 2010 among other provisions this legislation created the consumer financial protection bureau the bureau whose sole focus is to develop implement and with respect to financial institutions with more than 10 billion in assets enforce consumer protection rules promulgated by the bureau including enhanced oversight of nonfinancial institutions providing financial services for financial institutions with less than 10 billion in assets enforcement of the rules will be carried out by such institutions primary federal regulator certain of our businesses that affect end consumers are subject to examination from time to time 

the doddfrank act and related durbin amendment also revised the electronic fund transfer act efta by adding a new section 920 regarding limitations on certain interchange transaction fees and modification of certain payment card network rules this provision requires that the federal reserve board enact regulations governing interchange fees and network fees arising from electronic debit card and reloadable generaluse gift card transactions specifically the amount of interchange fees that apply to such transactions on cards issued by financial institutions with more than 10 billion in assets must be “reasonable and proportional” to the costs incurred by a financial institution in connection with such transactions pursuant to this provision the federal reserve boards final regulations announced on june 29 2011 and effective on october 1 2011 established a maximum permissible interchange fee that a covered issuer may receive for an electronic debit transaction in the amount of 021 per transaction and five basis points multiplied by the value of the transaction plus a possible 001 fraud prevention adjustment issuers that together with their affiliates have assets of less than 10 billion are exempt from these debit card interchange fee restrictions 

the maximum interchange fee established by the federal reserve board for covered transactions is a significant reduction from the preoctober 1 2011 per transaction average rate for fis interchange fees are primarily passthrough fees to nonregulated issuers and this change did not have a direct impact on our earnings however it is uncertain what the indirect financial impact will be on fis as certain of our clients are faced or may be faced with 

 8 

significant fee income reductions from the interchange rate changes moreover since not all regulations implementing the doddfrank act have been finalized we are uncertain as to what extent any future legislation may affect our business in the future this legislated interchange fee cap and reduction of fee income for financial institutions also has the potential to alter the type andor volume of cardbased transactions that we process on behalf of our customers but has had an insignificant impact thus far as we continue to monitor the market participants actions we believe we are competitively positioned to offset or take advantage of any potential shifts in payment transaction volume as we offer multiple payment solutions and options to our clients 

  

the doddfrank act and durbin amendment also prohibit payment card issuers and payment networks from restricting the number of networks over which electronic debit transactions may be processed to less than two unaffiliated networks the effective date for this network exclusivity prohibition was april 1 2012 with respect to issuers and october 1 2011 with respect to networks issuers and networks are also prohibited from inhibiting a merchants ability to direct the routing of the electronic debit transaction over any network that the issuer has enabled to process them the merchant routing provisions became effective on october 1 2011 these provisions of the durbin amendment favorably impacted transaction volumes in our nyce pin debit network in 2013 and 2012 however market participants actions may positively or negatively impact transaction volumes in the future for issuers of generaluse reloadable prepaid cards the network exclusivity prohibition provisions had an effective date of april 1 2013 or later in certain circumstances the impact of these regulations on our general use prepaid business has been insignificant to date 

the durbin amendment regulations and interchange fee provisions released by the federal reserve have been challenged in court and we are monitoring how any final judicial decision will impact our customers and our business 

 

 

the foregoing list of laws and regulations to which our company is subject is not exhaustive and the regulatory framework governing our operations changes continuously enactment of new laws and regulations may increasingly affect the operations of our business directly and indirectly which could result in substantial regulatory compliance costs litigation expense adverse publicity andor loss of revenue 

information security 

globally attacks on information technology systems continue to grow in frequency complexity and sophistication such attacks have become a point of focus for individuals businesses and governmental entities the objectives of these attacks include among other things gaining unauthorized access to systems to facilitate financial fraud disrupt operations cause denial of service events corrupt data and steal nonpublic sensitive information fis is not immune to such attacks as part of our business we electronically receive process store and transmit a wide range of confidential information including but not limited to sensitive information of our customers and personal consumer data we also operate payment cash access and

risk factors 

tableend 

in addition to the normal risks of business we are subject to significant risks and uncertainties including those listed below and others described elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k any of the risks described herein could result in a significant adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

risks related to our business and operations 

entity mergers or consolidations and business failures in the banking and financial services industry could adversely affect our business by eliminating some of our existing and potential customers and making us more dependent on a more limited number of customers 

there has been and continues to be substantial consolidation activity in the banking and financial services industry in addition many financial institutions that experienced negative operating results including some of our customers have failed these consolidations and failures reduce our number of potential customers and may reduce our number of existing customers which could adversely affect our revenues even if the events do not reduce the aggregate activities of the consolidated entities further if our customers fail andor merge with or are acquired by other entities that are not our customers or that use fewer of our services they may discontinue or reduce use of our services it is also possible that larger financial institutions resulting from consolidations would have greater leverage in negotiating terms or could decide to perform inhouse some or all of the services that we currently provide or could provide any of these developments could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

if we fail to innovate or adapt our services to changes in technology or in the marketplace or if our ongoing efforts to upgrade our technology are not successful we could lose customers and have difficulty attracting new customers for our services 

the markets for our services are characterized by constant technological changes frequent introductions of new services and evolving industry standards our future success will be significantly affected by our ability to enhance our current services and develop and introduce new services that address the increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers and their clients these initiatives carry the risks associated with any new service development effort including cost overruns delays in delivery and performance issues there can be no assurance that we will be successful in developing marketing and selling new services that meet these changing demands that we will not experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development introduction and marketing of these services or that our new services and their enhancements will adequately meet the demands of the marketplace and achieve market acceptance any of these developments could have an adverse impact on our future revenues andor business prospects 

we operate in a competitive business environment and if we are unable to compete effectively our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 

 10 

the market for our services is intensely competitive our competitors vary in size and in the scope and breadth of the services they offer some of our competitors have substantial resources we face direct competition from third parties and since many of our larger potential customers have historically developed their key applications inhouse and therefore view their system requirements from a makeversusbuy perspective we often compete against our potential customers’ inhouse capacities in addition we expect that the markets in which we compete will continue to attract new competitors and new technologies there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors or that the competitive pressures we face in the markets in which we operate will not materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations see item i business competition 

global economic political and other conditions including business cycles and consumer confidence may adversely affect our customers or trends in consumer spending which may adversely impact the demand for our services and our revenue and profitability 

a significant portion of our revenue is derived from transaction processing fees the global transaction processing industries depend heavily upon the overall level of consumer business and government spending any change in economic factors including a sustained deterioration in general economic conditions or consumer confidence particularly in the united states or increases in interest rates in key countries in which we operate may adversely affect consumer spending including related consumer debt reduce check writing and change credit and debit card usage and as a result adversely affect our financial performance by reducing the number or average purchase amount of transactions that we service 

constraints within global financial markets or international regulatory requirements could constrain our financial institution customers ability to purchase our services impacting our future growth and profitability 

a significant number of our customers and potential customers may hold sovereign debt or be subject to emerging international requirements such as basel iii which could require changes in their capitalization and hence the amount of their working capital available to purchase our services these organizations could have their capital constrained if the value of sovereign debt of nations such as greece spain italy ireland or portugal continues to decline if additional countries default on their debt or if emerging regulatory requirements such as basel iii require institutions to alter their capital structures these potential constraints could alter the ability of customers or potential customers to purchase our services and thus could have a significant impact on our future growth and profitability 

potential customers may be reluctant to switch to a new vendor which may adversely affect our growth 

for banks and other potential customers of our financial information software and services switching from one vendor of bank core processing or related software and services or from an internallydeveloped system to a new vendor is a significant undertaking many potential customers perceive potential disadvantages such as loss of accustomed functionality increased costs including conversion costs and business disruption as a result potential customers may resist change we seek to overcome this resistance through value enhancing strategies such as a defined conversion process system integration including bundling additional services and making ongoing investments to enhance the functionality of our software however there can be no assurance that our strategies for overcoming potential customers’ reluctance to change vendors will be successful and this resistance may adversely affect our growth 

the sales and implementation cycles for many of our software and service offerings can be lengthy and require significant investment from both our customers and fis if we fail to close sales or if a customer chooses not to complete an installation after expending significant time and resources to do so our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 

the sales and associated deployment of many of our software or service offerings often involve significant capital commitments by our customers andor fis potential customers generally commit significant resources to an evaluation of available software and services and require us to expend substantial time effort and money educating them prior to sales further as part of the sale or deployment of our software and services customers may also require fis to perform significant related services to complete a proof of concept or custom development to meet their needs all of the aforementioned activities may expend significant funds and management resources and ultimately the customer may determine not to close the sale or complete the implementation if we are unsuccessful in closing sales or if the customer decides not to complete an implementation after we expend significant funds and management resources or we experience delays it could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

failure to obtain new clients or renew client contracts on favorable terms could adversely affect results of operations and financial condition 

 11 

we may face pricing pressure in obtaining and retaining our larger clients larger clients may be able to seek price reductions from us when they renew a contract when a contract is extended or when the clients business has significant volume changes further our smaller and midsize clients may exert pricing pressure due to pricing competition or other economic needs or pressures being experienced by the customer on some occasions this pricing pressure results in lower revenue from a client than we had anticipated based on our previous agreement with that client this reduction in revenue could result in an adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

further failure to renew client contracts on favorable terms could have an adverse effect on our business our contracts with customers generally run for several years and provide for early termination fees terms are generally renegotiated prior to the end of a contracts term if we are not successful in achieving a high rate of contract renewals on favorable terms our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

we may experience defects development delays installation difficulties system failure or other service disruptions with respect to our technology solutions or execution problems with our transformation services which would harm our business and reputation and expose us to potential liability 

many of our services including our transformation services are based on sophisticated software and computing systems and we may encounter delays when developing new technology solutions and services further the technology solutions underlying our services have occasionally contained and may in the future contain undetected errors or defects when first introduced or when new versions are released in addition we may experience difficulties in installing or integrating our technologies on platforms used by our customers or our customers may cancel a project after we have expended significant effort and resources to complete an installation finally our systems and operations could be exposed to damage or interruption from fire natural disaster power loss telecommunications failure unauthorized entry and computer viruses defects in our technology solutions errors or delays in the processing of electronic transactions or other difficulties could result in i interruption of business operations ii delay in market acceptance iii additional development and remediation costs iv diversion of technical and other resources v loss of customers vi negative publicity or vii exposure to liability claims any one or more of the foregoing could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations although we attempt to limit our potential liability through controls including system redundancies security controls application development and testing controls and disclaimers and limitationofliability provisions in our license and customer agreements we cannot be certain that these measures will always be successful in preventing disruption or limiting our liability 

the doddfrank act may result in business changes for our customers that could have an adverse effect on our financial condition revenues results of operations or prospects for future growth and overall business  

our customers and as a result our associated software and services are required to comply with numerous regulations the doddfrank act and associated durbin amendment were passed and signed into law in 2010 the doddfrank act represents a comprehensive overhaul of the regulations governing the financial services industry within the united states established the consumer financial protection bureau and will require this and other federal agencies to implement many new regulations which have the potential to increase the amount and types of regulation on areas of our business that were not previously regulated the durbin amendment established interchange fee ceilings and allowed merchants to direct routing of transactions both effective october 1 2011 and established provisions that require all issuers to use at least two unaffiliated networks for processing effective april 1 2012 these changes may alter the nature or type of card programs offered by our customers which could have an ongoing impact on our future growth or revenue for debit cards debit network or other card programs further these changes could impact the volume or dollar amount of transactions that are routed through our network which could alter the number of transactions that we process and impact our future processing fee revenue the regulations and interchange fee provisions released by the federal reserve have been challenged in court and we are monitoring how any final judicial decision will impact our customers and our business 

several new regulations and rules will be written and implemented as directed by the aforementioned legislation and these new rules and regulations will require our customers or potential customers to comply with new requirements and could require fis to directly comply with new regulations see item i business government regulation for more information regarding certain of these new requirements these new requirements could result in the need for fis to make capital investments to modify our products and services to facilitate our customers and potential customers compliance as well as to deploy additional processes or reporting to comply with new regulations further requirements of the new regulations could result in changes in our customers business practices and those of other marketplace participants that may alter the delivery of services to consumers which could impact the demand for our software and services as well as alter the type or volume of transactions that we process on behalf of our customers as a result the new legislation could have an adverse impact on our financial condition revenues results of operations prospects for future growth and overall business 

 12 

many of our customers are subject to a regulatory environment and to industry standards that may change in a manner that reduces the number of transactions in which our customers engage and therefore reduces our revenues 

our customers are subject to a number of government regulations and industry standards with which our services must comply our customers must ensure that our services and related products work within the extensive and evolving regulatory and industry requirements applicable to them federal state foreign or industry authorities could adopt laws rules or regulations affecting our customers businesses that could lead to increased operating costs and could reduce the convenience and functionality of our products and services possibly resulting in reduced market acceptance in addition action by regulatory authorities relating to credit availability data usage privacy or other related regulatory developments could have an adverse effect on our customers and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

regulations enacted by the consumer financial protection bureau may require fis to enact new business practices which may require capital investment which could impact our future operating results 

the consumer financial protection bureau regulates financial and nonfinancial institutions and providers to those organizations the bureau is establishing its regulatory agenda and will likely pass additional rules for regulating nonfinancial institution providers to ensure adequate protection of consumer privacy and to ensure consumers are not impacted by deceptive business practices the impact of these rules may require fis or its subsidiaries to be subject to additional regulation and adopt additional business practices that could require additional capital expenditures or impact our operating results 

our revenues from the sale of services to members of visa mastercard american express discover and other similar organizations are dependent upon our continued certification and sponsorship and the loss or suspension of certification or sponsorship could adversely affect our business 

in order to provide our card processing services we must be certified including applicable sponsorship by visa mastercard american express discover and other similar organizations these certifications are dependent upon our continued adherence to the standards of the issuing bodies and sponsoring member banks the member financial institutions some of which are our competitors set the standards with which we must comply if we fail to comply with these standards we could be fined our certifications could be suspended or our registration could be terminated the suspension or termination of our certifications or any changes in the rules and regulations governing visa mastercard american express discover or other similar organizations could prevent our registration or otherwise limit our ability to provide services which could result in a reduction in revenue or increased costs of operation which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business 

changes in card association and debit network fees or products could increase costs or otherwise limit our operations 

from time to time card associations and debit networks increase the interchange fees that they charge it is possible that competitive pressures will result in our absorption of a portion of such increases in the future which would increase our operating costs reduce our profit margin and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operation furthermore the rules and regulations of the various card associations and networks prescribe certain capital requirements any increase in the capital level required would further limit our use of capital for other purposes 

interchange fees and related practices have been receiving significant legal and regulatory scrutiny worldwide the resulting regulatory changes that could occur from proposed regulations could alter the fees charged by card associations and debit networks worldwide the impact from the regulations could change from time to time and the resulting changes in fees could impact the card issuance or services offered by our customers which could have an adverse impact on our business or financial condition due to reductions or changes in types of transactions processed on behalf of our customers see item i business government regulation for more information 

if we fail to comply with applicable regulations or to meet regulatory expectations our business results of operations or financial condition could be adversely impacted 

the majority of our data processing services for financial institutions are not directly subject to federal or state regulations specifically applicable to financial institutions such as banks thrifts and credit unions however as a provider of services to these financial institutions our data processing operations are examined on a regular basis by various federal and state regulatory authorities if we fail to comply with any applicable regulations or guidelines for operations of a data services provider we could be subject to regulatory actions or regulatory rating changes may not meet contractual obligations or suffer harm to our client relationships or reputation failure to meet the aforementioned requirements or to adapt to new requirements 

 13 

at the federal state or international level could inhibit our ability to retain existing customers or obtain new customers which could have an adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition 

in addition to our data processing services described above we also have business operations that store process or transmit consumer information or have direct relationships with consumers that are obligated to comply with regulations including but not limited to the federal fair credit reporting act the federal fair debt collection practices act and applicable privacy requirements further our international businesses must comply with applicable laws such as the us foreign corrupt practices act failure to maintain compliance with or adapt to changes in any of the aforementioned requirements could result in fines penalties or regulatory actions that could have an adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition 

security breaches or attacks or our failure to comply with laws regulations or industry security requirements could harm our business by disrupting our delivery of services and damaging our reputation and could result in a breach of one or more client contracts 

we electronically receive process store and transmit sensitive business information of our customers in addition we collect personal consumer data such as names and addresses social security numbers drivers license numbers cardholder data and payment history records such information is necessary to support our customers transaction processing and to conduct our check authorization and collection businesses the uninterrupted operation of our information systems as well as the confidentiality of the customerconsumer information that resides on such systems is critical to our successful operation if we fail to maintain an adequate security infrastructure adapt to emerging security threats or implement sufficient security standards and technology to protect against security breaches the confidentiality of the information we secure could be compromised unauthorized access to our computer systems or databases could result in the theft or publication of confidential information the deletion or modification of records or could otherwise cause interruptions in our operations these risks are greater with increased information transmission over the internet and the increasing level of sophistication posed by cyber criminals 

our risk management and information security programs are the subject of ongoing review by the federal regulatory agencies with responsibility for oversight of our business in midmay 2013 the federal agencies that provide regulatory oversight for fis issued a confidential report related to their examination of our information security risk management and internal audit functions between october 2011 and october 2012 we responded to the report and described the actions that we have taken as well as ongoing efforts underway to address specific findings the regulatory agencies distributed the report and a cover letter to a subset of our regulated clients beginning in late may 2013 this prompted inquiries from clients which to the extent permitted by federal regulation fis has addressed on an individual basis we are unable to predict with certainty what if any further communications our regulators will have with our regulated financial institution clients we are also unable to predict the effect that any such communications may have on our business it remains possible that future actions by our regulators or clients related to this matter could have a material adverse impact on our business 

as a provider of services to financial institutions and a provider of card processing services we are bound by the same limitations on disclosure of the information we receive from our customers as apply to the customers themselves if we fail to comply with these regulations and industry security requirements we could be exposed to suits for breach of contract governmental proceedings the imposition of fines or prohibitions on card processing services in addition if more restrictive privacy laws rules or industry security requirements are adopted in the future on the federal or state level or by a specific industry body they could have an adverse impact on us through increased costs or restrictions on business processes any inability to prevent security or privacy breaches or the perception that such breaches may occur could cause our existing customers to lose confidence in our systems and terminate their agreements with us inhibit our ability to attract new customers result in increasing regulation or bring about other adverse consequences from the government agencies that regulate our business 

  

high profile payment card industry security breaches could impact consumer payment behavior patterns in the future and reduce our card payment transaction volumes 

   we are unable to predict whether or when high profile card payment security breaches will occur and if they occur whether consumers will transact less on their payment cards if consumers transact less on cards issued by our customers and we are not able to adapt to offer our customers new preferred consumer payment technologies it could have a significant adverse impact on our revenue and related earnings 

misappropriation of our intellectual property and proprietary rights or a finding that our patents are invalid could impair our competitive position 

 14 

our ability to compete depends upon proprietary systems and technology despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our services or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary or challenge the validity of our patents with governmental authorities policing unauthorized use of our proprietary rights is difficult we cannot make any assurances that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of technology or that the agreements entered into for that purpose will be enforceable effective patent trademark service mark copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our applications and services are made available online misappropriation of our intellectual property or potential litigation concerning such matters could have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 

if our applications or services are found to infringe the proprietary rights of others we may be required to change our business practices and may also become subject to significant costs and monetary penalties 

as our information technology applications and services develop we are increasingly subject to infringement claims any claims whether with or without merit could i be expensive and timeconsuming to defend ii result in an injunction or other equitable relief which could cause us to cease making licensing or using applications that incorporate the challenged intellectual property iii require us to redesign our applications if feasible iv divert management’s attention and resources and v require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements in order to obtain the right to use necessary technologies or pay damages resulting from any infringing use 

we face liability to our merchant customers if checks that we have guaranteed are dishonored by the check writer’s bank 

if a check that we have guaranteed is dishonored by the check writer’s bank we must reimburse our merchant customer for the check’s face value and pursue collection of the amount from the check writer in some cases we recognize a liability to our merchant customers for estimated check returns and a receivable for amounts we estimate we will recover from the check writers based on historical experience and other relevant factors the estimated check returns and recovery amounts are subject to the risk that actual amounts returned may exceed our estimates and actual amounts recovered by us may be less than our estimates 

lack of system integrity fraudulent payments credit quality related to funds settlement or the availability of clearing services could result in a financial loss 

we settle funds on behalf of financial institutions other businesses and consumers and receive funds from clients card issuers payment networks and consumers on a daily basis for a variety of transaction types transactions facilitated by us include debit card credit card electronic bill payment transactions ach payments and check clearing that supports consumers financial institutions and other businesses these payment activities rely upon the technology infrastructure that facilitates the verification of activity with counterparties the facilitation of the payment as well as the detection or prevention of fraudulent payments if the continuity of operations integrity of processing or ability to detect or prevent fraudulent payments were compromised this could result in a financial loss to us in addition we rely on various financial institutions to provide ach services in support of funds settlement for certain of our products if we are unable to obtain such ach services in the future that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations in addition we may issue credit to consumers financial institutions or other businesses as part of the funds settlement a default on this credit by a counterparty could result in a financial loss to us furthermore if one of our customers for which we facilitate settlement suffers a fraudulent event due to an error of their controls we may suffer a financial loss if the customer does not have sufficient capital to cover the loss 

failure to properly manage or mitigate risks in the operation of our wealth management business in the uk could have adverse liability consequences   

      we have a wealth management business in the uk engaged in processing securities transactions on behalf of customers and serving as a custodian failure to properly manage or mitigate risks in those operations and increased volatility in the financial markets may increase the magnitude of resulting losses including those that may arise from human errors or omissions defects or interruptions in computer or communications systems or breakdowns in processes or in internal controls human errors or omissions may include failures to comply with applicable laws or corporate policies and procedures theft fraud or misappropriation of assets whether arising from the intentional actions of internal personnel or external third parties     

we have business in emerging markets such as brazil and india these emerging markets may experience significant economic volatility in the future which could add volatility to our revenue and earnings

  in our isg segment we have operations in emerging markets primarily in brazil india and southeast asia these emerging market economies tend to be more volatile than the more established markets we serve in north america and europe which could add volatility to our future revenues and earnings 

our business is subject to the risks of international operations including movements in foreign currency exchange rates 

our international operations represent approximately 21  of total 2013  revenues which are largely conducted in currencies other than the us dollar including the brazilian real british pound euro and indian rupee as a result our financial condition and operating results could be significantly affected by risks associated with international activities including economic and labor conditions political instability tax laws including us taxes on foreign subsidiaries differences in business practices and changes in the value of the us dollar versus local currencies in addition we are less wellknown internationally than in the united states have less experience with local business conditions and may face challenges in successfully managing small operations located far from our headquarters because of the greater difficulty in overseeing and guiding operations from a distance 

as we expand our international operations more of our customers may pay us in foreign currencies conducting business in currencies other than us dollars subjects us to fluctuations in currency exchange rates our primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to foreign currencies in brazil europe australia and parts of asia the us dollar value of our net investments in foreign operations the periodic conversion of foreigndenominated earnings to the us dollar our reporting currency our results of operations and in some cases cash flows could be adversely affected in a material manner by movements in foreign currency exchange rates these risks could cause an adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations 

failure to attract and retain skilled technical employees or senior management personnel could harm our ability to grow 

our future success depends upon our ability to attract and retain highlyskilled technical personnel because the development of our products and services requires knowledge of computer hardware operating system software system management software and application software our technical personnel must be proficient in a number of disciplines competition for such technical personnel is intense and our failure to hire and retain talented personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

our future growth will also require sales and marketing financial and administrative personnel to develop and support new products and services to enhance and support current products and services and to expand operational and financial systems there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain the necessary personnel to accomplish our growth strategies and we may experience constraints that could adversely affect our ability to satisfy client demand in a timely fashion 

our ability to maintain compliance with applicable laws rules and regulations and to manage and monitor the risks facing our business relies upon the ability to maintain skilled compliance security risk and audit professionals competition for such skillsets is intense and our failure to hire and retain talented personnel could have an adverse effect on our internal control environment and impact our operating results 

our senior management team has significant experience in the financial services industry either at fis or with clients or competitors and the loss of this leadership could have an adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition further the loss of this leadership may have an adverse impact on senior managements ability to provide effective oversight and strategic direction for all key functions within the company which could impact our future business operating results and financial condition 

       we are the subject of various legal proceedings that could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability   

       we are involved in various litigation matters including in some cases classaction and patent infringement litigation if we are unsuccessful in our defense in the litigation matters we may be forced to pay damages andor change our business practices any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

 unfavorable resolution of tax contingencies or unfavorable future tax law changes could adversely affect our tax expense 

 16 

our tax returns and positions are subject to review and audit by federal state local and international taxing authorities an unfavorable outcome to a tax audit could result in higher tax expense and could negatively impact our effective tax rate financial position results of operations and cash flows in the current andor future periods unfavorable future tax law changes could also result in these negative impacts 

     risks related to business combinations and ventures 

we have a substantial investment in our brazilian venture and drive significant revenue through that venture that would be lost and result in significant termination costs if our venture partner were to terminate the agreement 

        revenue attributable to our brazilian venture partner banco bradesco accounted for 2962 million  in 2013  the contract that we have with our brazilian venture partner allows for the termination or partial termination of the contract at any point during the 10year term which ends september 30 2020 this risk of contract termination is mitigated by guaranteed performance targets and minimum payments that would be triggered upon the event of an early termination these payments have been established based on fis expected rate of return for the contract over a 10year period the required payments and buyouts decline each year and are further reduced by returns in excess of the expected returns for the contract and reduce the overall barrier to exiting the venture if our partner were to exit the agreement this could have a significant impact on our future revenue and growth for further detail on our brazilian venture see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements 

    additionally we employ approximately 11000 employees in brazil who would have the ability to file labor claims if their employment is terminated if our brazilian venture partner were to terminate the agreement we may be subject to labor claims filed by employees of the brazilian venture these claims if realized could result in a significant cost and impact to our earnings 

        we have substantial investments in recorded goodwill and other intangible assets as a result of prior acquisitions and a severe or extended economic downturn could cause these investments to become impaired requiring writedowns that would reduce our operating income 

as of december 31 2013  goodwill aggregated to 85000 million  or 609  of total assets and other indefinite lived intangible assets aggregated to 808 million  or 06  of total assets current accounting rules require goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets to be assessed for impairment at least annually or whenever changes in circumstances indicate potential impairment factors that may be considered a change in circumstance include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results a significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization and negative industry or economic trends the results of our 2013  annual assessment of the recoverability of goodwill indicated that the fair values of the company’s reporting units were in excess of the carrying values of those reporting units and thus no goodwill impairment existed as of december 31 2013  likewise the fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets was also in excess of the carrying value of those assets as of december 31 2013 however if worldwide or united states economic conditions decline significantly with negative impacts to bank spending and consumer behavior  or if other business or market changes impact our outlook  the carrying amount of our goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets may no longer be recoverable and we may be required to record an impairment charge which would have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

as of december 31 2013  intangible assets with definite useful lives aggregated to 12585 million  or 90  of total assets current accounting rules require intangible assets with definite useful lives to be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable factors that may be considered a change in circumstance include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results a significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization and negative industry or economic trends 

we will continue to monitor the fair value of our intangible assets as well as our market capitalization and the impact of any economic downturn on our business to determine if there is an impairment in future periods 

risks related to our indebtedness 

losses consolidations and failures in the financial services industry may impact our ability to borrow funds or the ability of our lenders to fulfill their obligations under our interest rate swap agreements 

 17 

some financial institutions continue to be challenged by negative operating results in certain cases these negative operating results have led to financial institution failures andor consolidations as a result lenders may become insolvent or further tighten lending standards which could in turn make it more difficult or impossible for lenders to perform their obligations under our interest rate swap agreements or for us to borrow under our revolving loan obtain financing on favorable terms or obtain financing or interest rate swap agreements at all our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if a financial institution fails to fulfill its obligations under our interest rate swap agreements or we are unable to draw funds under our revolving loan or obtain other costeffective financing 

our existing debt levels and future levels under existing facilities and debt service requirements may adversely affect our financial condition or operational flexibility and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our outstanding indebtedness 

as of december 31 2013  we had total debt of approximately 44686 million  this level of debt could have adverse consequences for our business financial condition operating results and operational flexibility including the following i the debt level may cause us to have difficulty borrowing money in the future for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions or other purposes ii our debt level may limit operational flexibility and our ability to pursue business opportunities and implement certain business strategies iii some of our debt has a variable rate of interest which exposes us to the risk of increased interest rates iv we have a higher level of debt than some of our competitors or potential competitors which may cause a competitive disadvantage and may reduce flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions including increased competition and vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  v there are significant maturities on our debt that we may not be able to fulfill or that may be refinanced at higher rates and vi  if we fail to satisfy our obligations under our outstanding debt or fail to comply with the financial or other restrictive covenants contained in the indenture governing our senior notes or our credit facility an event of default could result that could cause all of our debt to become due and payable 

the covenants relating to our notes and the fis credit agreement are limited and do not prohibit us from incurring additional debt or taking other actions that could exacerbate the risks described in the preceding risk factor or otherwise negatively impact holders of our notes 

we may be able to incur substantially more debt in the future although the indenture governing our notes and the agreements governing the fis credit agreement as both are defined in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements and other indebtedness each contain restrictions on our incurrence of additional indebtedness these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions and under certain circumstances indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial as of december 31 2013  we had approximately 19702 million  of borrowing capacity available under our existing fis credit agreement to the extent new debt is added to our current levels the risks described above could substantially increase

overview 

 fis is a leading global provider of banking and payments technologies complemented by strategic consulting services professional services and outsourcing services with a long history deeply rooted in the financial services industry and banking and payment technology solutions fis delivers services to more than 14000 institutions in over 100 countries headquartered in jacksonville florida fis employs more than 38000 employees worldwide and holds leadership positions in payment processing solutions and integrated banking solutions providing outsourced solutions software and services for technologies and processes that drive a financial institution’s operations through our capco brand we deliver globally a wide range of information technology consulting and transformational services to financial institutions fis has topped the annual fintech 100 list a ranking of financial services industry technology providers for the last three years and is a member of the fortune 500 us and of standard and poor’s sp 500 index 

business trends and conditions 

our revenue is primarily derived from a combination of recurring technology and processing services consulting and professional services and software license fees the majority of our revenue has historically been recurring provided under multiyear contracts that contribute relative stability to our revenue stream these services in general are considered critical to our customers operations a significant portion of these recurring revenues is derived from transaction processing fees that fluctuate with the level of deposit accounts and card transactions associated with consumer and commercial activity consulting and professional services revenues are typically nonrecurring and sales of software licenses are less predictable a portion of which can be regarded as discretionary spending by our customers 

one of the current trends in the financial services industry from which we are benefiting is the migration by our clients to an outsourced model to improve their profitability we compete for both licensing and outsourcing business and thus are affected by the decisions of financial institutions to use our services under an outsourced arrangement or to instead manage their technology operations internally under a software license and maintenance agreement with us as a provider of outsourcing solutions we benefit from multiyear recurring revenue streams which help moderate the effects of yeartoyear economic changes on our results of operations we believe our integrated solutions and outsourced services are targeted and well positioned to address this outsourcing trend across the markets we serve 

  

we believe that current market pressures in the financial services industry create an opportunity for our consulting and professional services many financial institutions are at an inflection point that demands that they transform their businesses to significantly reduce their cost base while also responding to the competitive pressures of innovation and to increased regulatory oversight with regard to information technology and related processes capco provides strategic consulting service capabilities to respond to these market needs consulting services revenue grew at an increased pace in 2013 and we expect this trend to continue in 2014 however if consulting and professional services revenue and gross margin grow as a percentage of our overall revenue and gross margin our overall gross margin percentage would be reduced as gross margin percentage realized for professional services is lower than that for most of our other services in addition as consulting and professional services revenue grow as a portion of our overall revenue we will have a lower overall percentage of recurring revenue as generally these services are nonrecurring  although our consulting revenue grew in 2013 our gross margins also improved slightly aided in part by nonrecurring termination fees from a significant customer that deconverted from certain of our services following a merger with another bank however the greater volume of consultingbased earnings in 2013 also contributed to our decision to take a charge for contingent payments due in connection with our 2010 acquisition of capco this charge adversely affected our operating margin in 2013 

we see in particular a market opportunity in large global financial institutions where we believe we can couple our strategic consulting and transformation services with outsourced technology services and solutions to help them achieve their business goals these large institutions are subject to the pressures described above that are generating revenue for our   

 25 

consulting services and moreover appear poised to increase technology spending to meet competitive pressures after a slowdown during the recent financial crisis years we are investing in management sales and account management resources to pursue this market opportunity our current target is to invest an incremental 30 million in this initiative in 2014 

  

mobile banking is growing in popularity as consumers embrace the convenience and younger digitalsavvy consumers grow in proportion to the banked population we expect this trend to continue and grow we continue to focus and invest in adapting and developing new mobile solutions to assist our customers with this transition 

  

we expect to see more demand for innovative solutions in the payments market that will deliver faster more convenient payment solutions in mobile channels internet applications and cards we believe mobile payments will grow and partially replace existing payment tender volumes over time this presents both a growth opportunity and a risk to us as the market develops mobile payment volume does not yet represent a significant amount of the payments market and it is unclear which technology or service will be the dominant solution additionally new nontraditional payments competitors are investing in and innovating mobile payment technologies to address the emerging market opportunity although we cannot predict which mobile payment technology or solution will be the most successful we cautiously believe our customer relationships payments infrastructure and experience adapted solutions and emerging solutions are well positioned to maintain or grow our customers existing payment volumes the growing risk of identity theft and fraud has also led to an increased demand for risk management solutions and we are focused on solutions to address this trend 

card transactions continue to grow as a percentage of overall payment volumes as consumers shift payments to cards from checks and cash we have invested in our card management solutions and card manufacturing and processing capabilities to accommodate emv integrated circuit cards often referred to as smart cards or chip cards so we can guide our customers through this anticipated technology transition sustain and grow our card driven businesses we continue to monitor the impacts of regulation on the payment card industry and the durbin amendment in particular  see businessgovernment   regulation section for more information to date the impact of the durbin amendment on our card payment volumes is insignificant we continuously monitor the marketplace as it adapts to the durbin amendment and its ongoing regulatory developments but are unable to determine at this time whether there will be a significant favorable or unfavorable impact on our payment card businesses in the future 

the durbin amendment has affected the marketplace for our eft network business as its rules and regulations allow merchants more discretion to determine their transaction network routing and to consider multiple alternative networks to date the impact of the durbin amendment has been modestly favorable to our eft network business as we have competed effectively at this time we are unable to determine whether there will be a significant favorable or unfavorable impact on our eft network business in the future 

the use of checks continues to decline as a percentage of total payments which negatively impacts our check warranty and itemprocessing businesses and we expect this trend to continue to date we have been able to successfully mitigate the majority of the impacts of this decline through cost and fraud efficiency actions and new market solutions which remain our continued focus 

while we are cautious regarding broader economic improvement we expect banks to continue investing in new technology and believe we are well positioned to capitalize as the overall market continues to recover we anticipate consolidation within the banking industry will continue primarily in the form of merger and acquisition activity as a whole consolidation activity is detrimental to our business however consolidation resulting from specific merger and acquisition transactions may be beneficial or detrimental to our business when consolidations occur merger partners often operate disparate systems licensed from competing service providers the newly formed entity generally makes a determination to migrate its core and payments systems to a single platform when a financial institution processing client is involved in a consolidation we may benefit by expanding the use of our services if such services are chosen to survive the consolidation and support the newly combined entity conversely we may lose market share if we are providing services to both entities or we are not the merging parties provider of core or payment processing or if a customer of ours is involved in a consolidation and our services are not chosen to survive the consolidation and support the newly combined entity it is also possible that larger financial institutions resulting from consolidation may have greater leverage in negotiating terms or could decide to perform inhouse some or all of the services that we currently provide or could provide we seek to mitigate the risks of consolidations by offering other competitive services to take advantage of specific opportunities at the surviving company 

notwithstanding challenging global economic conditions our international business continued to experience growth across all major regions on a constant currency basis during the year ended december 31 2013  including latin america europe and asia we expect this growth trend to continue as the result of the addition of new largescale outsourcing clients in all of these regions in 2013 and the demand opportunities we see for similar arrangements demand for our solutions will also be driven in 

 26 

developing countries by government led financial inclusion policies aimed to reduce the unbanked population and by growth in the middle classes in these markets driving the need for more sophisticated banking solutions the majority of our european revenue is generated by clients in germany france and the united kingdom 

information security 

globally attacks on information technology systems continue to grow in frequency complexity and sophistication this is a trend we expect will continue such attacks have become a point of focus for individuals businesses and governmental entities the objectives of these attacks include among other things gaining unauthorized access to systems to facilitate financial fraud disrupt operations cause denial of service events corrupt data and steal nonpublic information fis is not immune to such attacks as part of our business we electronically receive process store and transmit a wide range of confidential information including sensitive customer information and personal consumer data we also operate payment cash access and prepaid card systems fis like any large financial technology service provider is subject to attempted cyberattacks on a regular basis a successful cyberattack on an fis system that resulted in sensitive information being compromised fraud losses or other adverse consequences could have a material adverse effect on the company 

as a multiregional data processing servicer mdps fis continues to be examined by and have regular interaction with the federal agencies that regulate financial institutions these regulators have the authority to take actions they deem necessary to protect the safety and soundness of the financial institutions they regulate such actions if taken could have a material adverse impact on our business fis regularly reports to its regulators and to its clients regarding the companys continual efforts to enhance its information security and risk management technology programs and procedures in midmay 2013 the federal agencies that provide regulatory oversight for fis issued a confidential report related to their examination of our information security risk management and internal audit functions between october 2011 and october 2012 we responded to the report and described the actions that we have taken as well as ongoing efforts underway to address specific findings the regulatory agencies distributed the report and a cover letter to a subset of our regulated clients beginning in late may 2013 this prompted inquiries from clients which to the extent permitted by federal regulation fis has addressed on an individual basis while individual clients and prospects have expressed concern over the report we do not believe that it has had a material effect on the overall sales closures in 2013 or our sales pipeline however we continue to monitor sales activity and any potential impact on future periods we are unable to predict with certai nty what if any communications or actions our regulators will have or take with our regulated financial institution clients with respect to our risk management and information security we are also unable to predict the effect that any such communications or actions may have o n our business 

fis remains focused on providing strategic investments in information security to protect its clients and its information systems this includes both capital expenditures and operating expense on hardware software personnel and consulting services 

critical accounting policies 

the accounting policies described below are those we consider critical in preparing our consolidated financial statements these policies require management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures with respect to contingent liabilities and assets at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods actual amounts could differ from those estimates see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed description of the significant accounting policies that have been followed in preparing our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

the company generates revenues from the delivery of bank processing credit and debit card processing services other payment processing services professional services software licensing and software related services revenues are recognized when evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred fees are fixed or determinable and collection is considered probable we are frequently a party to multiple concurrent contracts with the same customer these situations require judgment to determine whether the individual contracts should be aggregated or evaluated separately for purposes of revenue recognition in making this determination we consider the timing of negotiating and executing the contracts whether the different elements of the contracts are interdependent and whether any of the payment terms of the contracts are interrelated our individual contracts also frequently include multiple elements we must apply judgment in these circumstances in determining whether individual elements can be considered separate units of accounting or should instead be accounted for in combination with other deliverables judgment is also required in ascribing fair value to each deliverable for purposes of allocating consideration due to the large number broad nature and average size of individual contracts we are party to the impact of judgments and assumptions that we apply in recognizing revenue for any single contract is not likely to have a material effect 

 27 

on our consolidated operations or financial position however the broader accounting policy assumptions that we apply across similar arrangements or classes of customers could significantly influence the timing and amount of revenue recognized in our historical and future results of operations or financial position additional information about our revenue recognition policies is included in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

the company analyzes trade accounts receivable by considering historical bad debts customer creditworthiness current economic trends changes in customer payment terms and collection trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts any change in the assumptions used may result in an additional allowance for doubtful accounts being recognized in the period in which the change occurs 

provision for check guarantee losses 

in our check guarantee business if a guaranteed check presented to a merchant customer is dishonored by the check writer’s bank we reimburse our merchant customer for the check’s face value and pursue collection of the amount from the delinquent check writer loss provisions and anticipated recoveries are primarily determined by performing a historical analysis of our check loss and recovery experience and considering other factors that could affect that experience in the future such factors include the general economy the overall industry mix of our customer volumes statistical analysis of check fraud trends within our customer volumes and the quality of returned checks the estimated check returns and recovery amounts are subject to the risk that actual amounts returned and recovered may be different than our estimates 

historically our estimation processes have proved to be materially accurate however our projections of probable check guarantee losses and anticipated recoveries are inherently uncertain and as a result we cannot predict with certainty the amount of such items changes in economic conditions the risk characteristics and composition of our customers and other factors could impact our actual and projected amounts we recorded check guarantee losses net of anticipated recoveries excluding service fees of 573 million  547 million  and 680 million  respectively for the years ended december 31 2013  2012  and 2011  a ten percent difference in our estimated check guarantee loss provisions net of estimated recoveries as of december 31 2013  would have impacted 2013 net earnings by less than 20 million aftertax 

computer software 

computer software includes the fair value of software acquired in business combinations purchased software and capitalized software development costs purchased software is recorded at cost and amortized using the straightline method over its estimated useful life and software acquired in business combinations is recorded at its fair value and amortized using straightline or accelerated methods over its estimated useful life 

the capitalization of software development costs is governed by fasb asc subtopic 98520 if the software is to be sold leased or otherwise marketed or by fasb asc subtopic 35040 if the software is for internal use after the technological feasibility of the software has been established for software to be marketed or at the beginning of application development for internaluse software software development costs which include primarily salaries and related payroll costs and costs of independent contractors incurred during development are capitalized research and development costs incurred prior to the establishment of technological feasibility for software to be marketed or prior to application development for internaluse software are expensed as incurred software development costs are amortized on a productbyproduct basis commencing on the date of general release of the products for software to be marketed or the date placed in service for internaluse software software development costs for software to be marketed are amortized using the greater of 1 the straightline method over its estimated useful life which ranges from three to 10 years or 2 the ratio of current revenues to total anticipated revenues over its useful life 

in determining useful lives management considers historical results and technological trends that may influence the estimate useful lives for all computer software range from three to 10 years we also assess the recorded value of computer software for impairment on a regular basis by comparing the carrying value to the estimated future cash flows to be generated by the underlying software asset for software to be marketed there are inherent uncertainties in determining the expected useful life or cash flows to be generated from computer software while we have not historically experienced significant changes in these estimates our results of operations could be subject to such changes in the future

goodwill and other intangible assets 

we are required to allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction at their estimated fair values the estimates used to determine the fair value of longlived assets such as intangible assets are complex and require a significant amount of management judgment we generally engage independent valuation specialists to assist us in making fair value determinations we are also required to estimate the useful lives of intangible assets to determine the amount of acquisitionrelated intangible asset amortization expense to record in future periods we periodically review the estimated useful lives assigned to our definitelived intangible assets to determine whether such estimated useful lives continue to be appropriate additionally we review our indefinitelived intangible assets to determine if there is any change in circumstances that may indicate the asset’s useful life is no longer indefinite 

goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives should not be amortized but shall be tested for impairment annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate potential impairment in 2011 the fasb issued accounting standards update no 201108 asu 201108 testing goodwill for impairment the revised standard allows an entity first to assess qualitatively whether it is more likely than not that a reporting units carrying amount exceeds its fair value referred to in the guidance as step zero if an entity concludes that it is more likely than not that a reporting units fair value is less than its carrying amount that is a likelihood of more than 50 percent the step one quantitative assessment must be performed for that reporting unit asu 201108 provided examples of events and circumstances that should be considered in performing the step zero qualitative assessment including macroeconomic conditions industry and market considerations cost factors overall financial performance events affecting a reporting unit or the entity as a whole and a sustained decrease in share price   

  we assess goodwill for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter using a september 30th measurement date unless circumstances require a more frequent measurement for 2013 and 2011 we began our assessment with the step zero qualitative analysis because there was a substantial excess of fair value over carrying value for each of our reporting units in the 2012 and 2010 step one analyses in performing the step zero qualitative analysis for each of 2013 and 2011 examining those factors most likely to affect our valuations we concluded that it remained more likely than not that the fair value of each of our reporting units continued to exceed their carrying amounts consequently we did not perform a step one analysis in 2013 or 2011 

for 2012 primarily for the purpose of validating our valuation assumptions we elected to proceed directly to the step one quantitative analysis rather than perform the step zero qualitative assessment in applying the quantitative analysis we determine the fair value of our reporting units based on a weighted average of multiple valuation techniques principally a combination of an income approach and a market approach the income approach calculates a value based upon the present value of estimated future cash flows while the market approach uses earnings multiples of similarly situated guideline public companies if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the reporting unit’s net assets goodwill is not impaired and further testing is not required based upon the results of this test there were no indications of impairment for any of our reporting units for 2012 

we also estimate the fair value of acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives and compare this amount to the underlying carrying value annually fasb accounting standards update no 201202 asu 201202 modified the former requirement to perform an annual quantitative impairment test for indefinitelived intangible assets similar to the asu 201108 guidance for goodwill it allows an organization to first perform a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that an asset has been impaired 

 for 2013 we began our assessment with the step zero qualitative analysis because there was a substantial excess of fair value over carrying value for each of our indefinitelived intangible assets in 2012 based upon the results of this test there were no indications of impairment except for one trademark with nominal value for 2012 we proceeded directly with a quantitative analysis using a form of income approach valuation known as the relieffromroyalty method our tests did not result in the impairment of any of our intangible assets for 2012 while the same tests performed in 2011 did result in an impairment charge of 91 million related to the capco trademark in north america 

determining the fair value of a reporting unit or acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives involves judgment and the use of significant estimates and assumptions which include assumptions regarding the revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate estimated future cash flows riskadjusted discount rates and future economic and market conditions and other assumptions

accounting for income taxes 

as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements we are required to determine income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate this process involves estimating actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing recognition of items for income tax and financial reporting purposes these differences result in deferred income tax assets and liabilities which are included within the consolidated balance sheets we must then assess the likelihood that deferred income tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely establish a valuation allowance to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase or decrease this allowance in a period we must reflect this increase or decrease as an expense or benefit within income tax expense in the consolidated statements of earnings determination of the income tax expense requires estimates and can involve complex issues that may require an extended period to resolve further changes in the geographic mix of revenues or in the estimated level of annual pretax income can cause the overall effective income tax rate to vary from period to period we also receive periodic assessments from taxing authorities challenging our positions that must be taken into consideration in determining our tax reserves resolving these assessments which may or may not result in additional taxes due may also require an extended period of time we believe that our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that we adequately account for any known tax contingencies we believe the estimates and assumptions used to support our evaluation of tax benefit realization are reasonable however final determination of prioryear tax liabilities either by settlement with tax authorities or expiration of statutes of limitations could be materially different than estimates reflected in assets and liabilities and historical income tax provisions the outcome of these final determinations could have a material effect on our income tax provision net income or cash flows in the period that a determination is made

processing and services revenues 

processing and services revenues totaled 60707 million  58076 million  and 56256 million  in 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively the increase in revenue during 2013  of 2631 million  or 45  as compared to 2012  is primarily attributable to transaction growth and demand for professional and consulting services higher termination fees incremental revenues from 2013  and 2012  acquisitions of 557 million and increased processing volumes the 2013  period included 496 million of unfavorable foreign currency impact resulting from a stronger us dollar as compared to 2012  the increase in revenue during 2012  of 1820 million  or 32  as compared to 2011  is primarily attributable to increased processing volumes transaction growth and demand for professional and consulting services plus incremental revenues from 2012  acquisitions of 262 million total revenue growth in 2013 and 2012 was partially offset by customer losses and lower retail check activity the 

 31 

2012  period included 1008 million of unfavorable foreign currency impact resulting from a stronger us dollar as compared to 2011  

cost of revenues and gross profit 

cost of revenues totaled 40856 million  39469 million  and 39191 million  in 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively resulting in gross profit of 19851 million  18607 million  and 17065 million  in 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively gross profit as a percentage of revenues “gross margin” was 327  320  and 303  in 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively the increase in gross profit during 2013  as compared to 2012  primarily resulted from the revenue variances discussed above the increase in gross margin for 2013  as compared to 2012  primarily reflects the impact of a more favorable revenue mix as higher margin processing revenue and termination fees drove margin expansion that was partially offset by increases in lower margin consulting revenue and 161 million of the capco acquisition related adjustments described in note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements the increase in gross margin during 2012  as compared to 2011  is due to increased operating leverage and cost management initiatives 

selling general and administrative expenses 

selling general and administrative expenses totaled 9207 million  7815 million  and 6479 million  for 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively the 2013  increase of 1392 million  as compared to 2012  was primarily due to charges of 1311 million for the capco acquisition related adjustments described in note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements the 2013 period also included higher sales and marketing expense an increase in healthcare benefit expense and increased investment in security and risk management the 2012  increase of 1336 million  as compared to 2011  was primarily due to increased compensation costs and costs to enhance administrative support of operational functions including information security and risk and compliance the 2012 compensation costs included 432 million in payments and accelerated vesting of certain stock option and restricted stock grants triggered by changes in responsibility or separation from the company of certain executives the 2011  period benefited from a 223 million  reduction in the contingent consideration liability related to the capco acquisition but included a 130 million loss related to unauthorized activities on the sunrise prepaid card platform 

impairment charges 

impairment charges totaling 91 million  were recorded in 2011  and related to a reduction in the carrying value of the capco trademark in north america 

operating income 

operating income totaled 10644 million  10792 million  and 10495 million  for 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively   operating income as a percentage of revenue “operating margin” was 175  186  and 187  for 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively the annual changes in operating income and operating margin resulted from the revenue and cost variances addressed above 

total other income expense 

total other income expense was 2394 million  2480 million  and 3225 million  for 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively the primary component of total other income expense is interest expense which totaled 1986 million 2313 million and 2648 million for 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively the decrease of 327 million  in interest expense in 2013  as compared to 2012  resulted from lower borrowing rates as the result of debt refinancing in addition to interest expense the 2013 period also includes a charges of 161 million for the writeoff of certain previously capitalized debt issuance costs and transaction expenses related to refinancing activities b a net charge of 453 million representing the 516 million premium incurred for the early redemption of certain debt offset by the premium reflected in the carrying value of that debt and c a 92 million gain resulting from the purchase of the remaining shares of mfoundry representing the difference between the fair value and carrying value of the minorityinterest investment previously held the decrease of 335 million  in interest expense in 2012  as compared to 2011  resulted from lower borrowing rates combined with a reduction in total debt outstanding apart from interest expense 2012  included 184 million in costs related to the writeoff of certain previously capitalized debt issuance costs resulting from the early pay down of certain debt and related refinancing activities in comparison 2011  included 388 million of debt refinancing expenses including 247 million of previously capitalized debt issuance costs and a 340 million otherthantemporary impairment of availableforsale securities acquired in conjunction with the acquisition of metavante

provision for income taxes 

income tax expense from continuing operations totaled 3092 million  2709 million  and 2324 million  for 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively this resulted in an effective tax rate on continuing operations of 375  326  and 320  for 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively the capco contingent consideration that was recorded in 2013 is not deductible for tax purposes and therefore had an unfavorable impact on the 2013 effective tax rate which otherwise would have been comparable to 2012  the tax rates were comparable during the 2012  and 2011  periods 

earnings loss from discontinued operations 

during 2013  2012  and 2011  certain operations are classified as discontinued as discussed in note 3 of the notes to consolidated financial statements reporting for discontinued operations classifies revenues and expenses as one line item net of tax in the consolidated statements of earnings the table below outlines the components of discontinued operations for 2013  2012  and 2011  net of tax in millions

corporate and other 

the corporate and other segment results consist of selling general and administrative expenses and depreciation and intangible asset amortization not otherwise allocated to the reportable segments corporate and other expenses were 8736 million  7204 million  and 6411 million  in 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively the overall corporate and other increase of 1532 million  for 2013  as compared to 2012  was primarily due to charges of 1291 million for the capco contingent consideration adjustments described in note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements the 2013 period also included higher sales and marketing expense an increase in healthcare benefit expense and increased investment in security and risk management the overall corporate and other increase of 793 million  for 2012  as compared to 2011  was primarily due to increased compensation costs including stockbased compensation and benefits and costs to enhance administrative support of operational functions including information security and risk and compliance the compensation charges include 432 million related to payments and the accelerated vesting of certain stock option and restricted stock grants triggered by changes in responsibility or separation from the company of certain executives the 2011  period included the 130 million loss related to unauthorized activities on the sunrise prepaid card platform noted under selling general and administrative expenses  in the consolidated results of operations  section above 95 million in merger integration and service costs and a 132 million net benefit from adjustments from the capco acquisition the latter was comprised of a reduction in the contingent consideration liability of 223 million  partially offset by a 91 million impairment of the north american trademark 

liquidity and capital resources 

cash requirements 

our ongoing cash requirements include operating expenses income taxes mandatory debt service payments capital expenditures stockholder dividends working capital and timing differences in settlementrelated assets and liabilities and may include discretionary debt service share repurchases and business acquisitions our cash requirements also include payments for capcos contingent consideration earnout and for labor claims related to fis former item processing and remittance operations in brazil see notes 6 and 3 respectively in the notes to consolidated financial statements our principal sources 

 35 

of funds are cash generated by operations and borrowings including the capacity under our revolving loan described in note 13 in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

as of december 31 2013  we had cash and cash equivalents of 5475 million  and debt of 44686 million  including the current portion of the 5475 million  cash and cash equivalents approximately 3689 million  is held by our foreign entities and would generally be subject to us income taxation upon repatriation to the us the majority of our domestic cash and cash equivalents represents net depositsintransit at the balance sheet dates and relates to daily settlement activity we expect that cash and cash equivalents plus cash flows from operations over the next twelve months will be sufficient to fund our operating cash requirements capital expenditures and mandatory debt service 

we currently expect to continue to pay quarterly dividends which we have increased substantially over recent years from 005 to 020 per share per quarter in 2012 and then to 022 per share per quarter in 2013 on january 29 2014 the board of directors approved an additional increase to 024 per share per quarter beginning with the first quarter of 2014 however the amount declaration and payment of future dividends is at the discretion of the board of directors and depends on among other things our investment opportunities results of operations financial condition cash requirements future prospects and other factors that may be considered relevant by our board of directors including legal and contractual restrictions additionally the payment of cash dividends may be limited by covenants in certain debt agreements a regular quarterly dividend of 024 per common share is payable on march 31 2014 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on march 17 2014 

cash flows from operations 

cash flows from operations were 10603 million  10467 million  and 11715 million  in 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively cash flows from operations increased 136 million  in 2013  and decreased 1248 million  in 2012  the 2013  increase in cash flows from operations is primarily due to higher net earnings the timing of merchant and card transaction settlement activity and other changes in working capital partially offset by a 516 million bond premium payment resulting from the early pay down of our 2017 senior notes in the first half of 2013 and by the 420 million payment associated with the capco acquisition liabilities the decrease in 2012  was primarily due to the payment of 1054 million of income taxes related to the sale of our healthcare business and fluctuations in the timing of merchant and card transaction settlement activity offset by other changes in working capital 

capital expenditures and other investing activities 

our principal capital expenditures are for computer software purchased and internally developed and additions to property and equipment we invested approximately 3362 million  2961 million  and 3003 million  in capital expenditures during 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively we expect to invest approximately 556 of 2014  revenue in capital expenditures 

we used 1505 million 636 million and 202 million of cash during 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively for acquisitions and other equity investments see note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the more significant items cash provided by net proceeds from sale of assets in 2012 relates principally to the sale of the healthcare benefit solutions business discussed in note 3

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risks 

tableend 

  market risk 

we are exposed to market risks primarily from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates we use certain derivative financial instruments including interest rate swaps and foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage interest rate and foreign currency risk we do not use derivatives for trading purposes to generate income or to engage in speculative activity 

interest rate risk 

in addition to existing cash balances and cash provided by operating activities we use fixed rate and variable rate debt to finance our operations we are exposed to interest rate risk on these debt obligations and related interest rate swaps 

the senior notes as described in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements represent substantially all of our fixedrate longterm debt obligations the carrying value of the notes was 24500 million  as of december 31 2013  the fair value of the senior notes was approximately 24415 million  as of december 31 2013  the potential reduction in fair value of the senior notes from a hypothetical 10  percent increase in market interest rates would not be material to the overall fair value of the debt 

our floating rate longterm debt obligations principally relate to borrowings under the fis credit agreement as defined in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements an increase of 100 basis points in the libor rate would increase our annual debt service under the fis credit agreement after we include the impact of our interest rate swaps by 73 million  based on principal amounts outstanding as of december 31 2013  we performed the foregoing sensitivity analysis based on the principal amount of our floating rate debt as of december 31 2013  less the principal amount of such debt that was then subject to an interest rate swap converting such debt into fixed rate debt this sensitivity analysis is based solely on the principal amount of such debt as of december 31 2013  and does not take into account any changes that occurred in the prior 12 months or that may take place in the next 12 months in the amount of our outstanding debt or in the notional amount of outstanding interest rate swaps in respect of our debt further in this sensitivity analysis the change in interest rates is assumed to be applicable for an entire year for comparison purposes based on principal amounts of floating rate debt outstanding as of december 31 2012  and calculated in the same manner as set forth above an increase of 100 basis points in the libor rate would have increased our annual interest expense after we calculate the impact of our interest rate swaps by 93 million  

 37 

we use interest rate swaps for the purpose of managing our interest expense through the mix of fixed rate and floating rate debt during the year ended december 31 2013  the notional amount of our outstanding interest rate swaps decreased by 6000 million  a s of december 31 2013  we have entered into the following interest rate swap transactions converting a portion of the interest rate exposure on our term and revolving loans from variable to fixed in millions 



 

 we have designated these interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes a portion of the amount included in accumulated other comprehensive earnings is reclassified into interest expense as a yield adjustment as interest payments are made on the term and revolving loans in accordance with the authoritative guidance for fair value measurements the inputs used to determine the estimated fair value of our interest rate swaps are level 2type measurements we considered our own credit risk and the credit risk of the counterparties when determining the fair value of our interest rate swaps 

foreign currency risk 

we are exposed to foreign currency risks that arise from normal business operations these risks include the translation of local currency balances of foreign subsidiaries transaction gains and losses associated with intercompany loans with foreign subsidiaries and transactions denominated in currencies other than a locations functional currency our objective is to minimize our exposure to these risks through a combination of normal operating activities and the use of foreign currency forward exchange contracts contracts are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries 

our exposure to foreign currency exchange risks generally arises from our nonus operations to the extent they are conducted in local currency changes in foreign currency exchange rates affect translations of revenues denominated in currencies other than the us dollar our international operations generated approximately 12739 million  11805 million  and 11776 million  in revenues during the years ended december 31 2013  2012  and 2011  of which approximately 10868 million  10092 million  and 10058 million  respectively was denominated in currencies other than the us dollar the major currencies to which our revenues are exposed are the brazilian real the euro the british pound sterling and the indian rupee a 10 move in average exchange rates for these currencies assuming a simultaneous and immediate 10 change in all of such rates for the relevant period would have resulted in the following increase or decrease in our reported revenues for the years ended december 31 2013  2012  and 2011  in millions 



 38 

the impact on earnings of the foregoing assumed 10 change in each of the periods presented would not have been significant our international operations revenues and expenses are generally denominated in local currency which limits the majority of our economic exposure to foreign exchange risk in those jurisdictions 

 revenue included 496 million  and 1008 million  and operating income included 119 million  and 90 million  respectively of unfavorable foreign currency impact during 2013  and 2012   resulting from a stronger us dollar during these years compared to the preceding year 

our foreign exchange risk management policy permits the use of derivative instruments such as forward contracts and options to reduce volatility in our results of operations andor cash flows resulting from foreign exchange rate fluctuations we do not enter into foreign currency derivative instruments for trading purposes we do periodically enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency exposure to intercompany loans as of december 31 2013  the notional amount of these derivatives was approximately 573 million  and the fair value was nominal these derivatives are intended to hedge the foreign exchange risks related to intercompany loans but have not been designated as hedges for accounting purposes

as part of our research and development process we evaluate current and emerging technology for compatibility with our existing and future software platforms to this end we engage with various hardware and software vendors in evaluation of various infrastructure components where appropriate we use thirdparty technology components in the development of our software applications and service offerings thirdparty software may be used for highly specialized business functions which we may not be able to develop internally within time and budget constraints additionally thirdparty software may be used for commoditytype functions within a technology platform environment in the case of nearly all of our thirdparty software enterprise license agreements exist for the thirdparty component and either alternative suppliers exist or transfer rights exist to ensure the continuity of supply as a result we are not materially dependent upon any thirdparty technology components we work with our customers to determine the appropriate timing and approach to introducing technology or infrastructure changes to our applications and services in the years ended december 31 2012  2011  and 2010  approximately 2 to 3 of revenues were invested in research and development efforts excluding amounts capitalized 

government regulation 

our services are subject to a broad range of complex federal state and foreign regulation including federal truthinlending and truthinsavings rules regulation aa unfair or deceptive acts or practices privacy laws usury laws the equal credit opportunity act the electronic funds transfer act the fair credit reporting act the fair debt collection practices act the bank secrecy act the usa patriot act the internal revenue code the employee retirement income security act the health insurance portability and accountability act the community reinvestment act and the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the doddfrank act the compliance of our services with these and other applicable laws and regulations depends on a variety of factors including the manner in which our clients use them our clients are contractually responsible for determining what is required of them under applicable laws and regulations so that we can assist them in their compliance efforts the failure of our services to comply with applicable laws and regulations could result in restrictions on our ability to provide them as well as the imposition of civil fines andor criminal penalties the principal areas of regulation impacting our business are

the collection laws as well as the various credit reporting laws in furtherance of our objectives of data accuracy fair treatment of consumers protection of consumers’ personal information and compliance with these laws we strive to maintain a high level of security for our computer systems in which consumer data resides and we maintain consumer relations call centers to facilitate efficient handling of consumer requests for information and handling disputes 

the housing assistance tax act of 2008 requires among other provisions information reporting obligations on payment settlement entities for calendar years beginning after december 31 2010 this law requires every merchant acquiring entity and thirdparty settlement organization to file information returns for the gross amount of reportable payment transactions for the calendar year and the reportable payment transactions for each month of the calendar year the reportable payment transactions are any transactions in which a payment card is accepted as payment and any thirdparty payment network this law resulted in significant additional form 1099 reporting requirements for fis 

the doddfrank act was enacted and signed into law on july 21 2010 among other provisions this legislation created the consumer financial protection bureau the bureau whose sole focus is to develop implement and with respect to financial institutions with more than 10 billion in assets enforce consumer protection rules promulgated by the bureau including enhanced oversight of nonfinancial institutions providing financial services for financial institutions with less than 10 billion in assets enforcement of the rules will be carried out by such institutions primary federal regulator 

the doddfrank act also amended the electronic fund transfer act efta by adding a new section 920 regarding limitations on certain interchange transaction fees and modification of certain payment card network rules this provision requires that the federal reserve board enact regulations governing interchange fees and network fees arising from electronic debit card and reloadable generaluse gift card transactions specifically the amount of interchange fees that apply to such transactions on cards issued by financial institutions with more than 10 billion in assets must be “reasonable and proportional” to the costs incurred by a financial institution in connection with such transactions pursuant to this provision the federal reserve boards final regulations announced on june 29 2011 and effective on october 1 2011 establish a maximum permissible interchange fee that a covered issuer may receive for an electronic debit transaction in the amount of 021 per transaction and five basis points multiplied by the value of the transaction plus a possible 001 fraud prevention adjustment issuers that together with their affiliates have assets of less than 10 billion are exempt from these debit card interchange fee restrictions 

the maximum interchange fee established by the federal reserve board for covered transactions is a significant reduction from the preoctober 1 2011 per transaction average rate for fis interchange fees are primarily passthrough fees to nonregulated issuers and this change did not have a direct impact on our earnings however it is uncertain what the indirect financial impact will be on fis as our clients are faced with significant revenue reductions from the interchange rate changes moreover since not all regulations implementing the doddfrank act have been finalized we are uncertain as to what extent the legislation may affect our business in the future the remaining proposed regulations do not appear to be intended to directly affect interchange fees applicable to credit card transactions but they do prohibit networks from “inhibiting” retailers from setting minimum purchase amounts for use of credit cards as long as the minimum purchase amount is not greater than 10 so long as the value does not differentiate between card issuers or payment card networks 

the doddfrank act also prohibits payment card issuers and payment networks from restricting the number of networks over which electronic debit transactions may be processed to less than two unaffiliated networks the effective date for this network exclusivity prohibition was april 1 2012 with respect to issuers and october 1 2011 with respect to networks issuers of certain healthrelated and other benefit cards and generaluse prepaid cards have a delayed effective date of april 1 2013 or later in certain circumstances 

issuers and networks are also prohibited from inhibiting a merchants ability to direct the routing of the electronic debit transaction over any network that the issuer has enabled to process them the merchant routing provisions became effective on october 1 2011

risk factors 

tableend 

in addition to the normal risks of business we are subject to significant risks and uncertainties including those listed below and others described elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k any of the risks described herein could result in a significant adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

risks related to our business and operations 

consolidations and business failures in the banking and financial services industry could adversely affect our business by eliminating some of our existing and potential customers and making us more dependent on a more limited number of customers 

there has been and continues to be substantial consolidation activity in the banking and financial services industry in addition many financial institutions that experienced negative operating results including some of our customers have failed these consolidations and failures reduce our number of potential customers and may reduce our number of existing customers which could adversely affect our revenues even if the events do not reduce the aggregate activities of the consolidated entities further if our customers fail andor merge with or are acquired by other entities that are not our customers or that use fewer of our services they may discontinue or reduce use of our services it is also possible that larger financial institutions resulting from consolidations would have greater leverage in negotiating terms or could decide to perform inhouse some or all of the services that we currently provide or could provide any of these developments could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

if we fail to adapt our services to changes in technology or in the marketplace or if our ongoing efforts to upgrade our technology are not successful we could lose customers and have difficulty attracting new customers for our services 

the markets for our services are characterized by constant technological changes frequent introductions of new services and evolving industry standards our future success will be significantly affected by our ability to enhance our current services and develop and introduce new services that address the increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers and their clients these initiatives carry the risks associated with any new service development effort including cost overruns delays in delivery and performance issues there can be no assurance that we will be successful in developing marketing and selling new services that meet these changing demands that we will not experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development introduction and marketing of these services or that our new services and their enhancements will adequately 

meet the demands of the marketplace and achieve market acceptance any of these developments could have an adverse impact on our future revenues andor business prospects 

we operate in a competitive business environment and if we are unable to compete effectively our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 

the market for our services is intensely competitive our competitors vary in size and in the scope and breadth of the services they offer some of our competitors have substantial resources we face direct competition from third parties and since many of our larger potential customers have historically developed their key applications inhouse and therefore view their system requirements from a makeversusbuy perspective we often compete against our potential customers’ inhouse capacities in addition we expect that the markets in which we compete will continue to attract new competitors and new technologies there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors or that the competitive pressures we face in the markets in which we operate will not materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations see item i business competition 

global economic political and other conditions including business cycles and consumer confidence may adversely affect our customers or trends in consumer spending which may adversely impact the demand for our services and our revenue and profitability 

a significant portion of our revenue is derived from transaction processing fees the global transaction processing industries depend heavily upon the overall level of consumer business and government spending any change in economic factors including a sustained deterioration in general economic conditions or consumer confidence particularly in the united states or increases in interest rates in key countries in which we operate may adversely affect consumer spending including related consumer debt reduce check writing and change credit and debit card usage and as a result adversely affect our financial performance by reducing the number or average purchase amount of transactions that we service 

constraints within global financial markets or international regulatory requirements could constrain our financial institution customers ability to purchase our services impacting our future growth and profitability 

a significant number of our customers and potential customers may hold sovereign debt or be subject to emerging international requirements such as basel iii which could require changes in their capitalization and hence the amount of their working capital available to purchase our services these organizations could have their capital constrained if the value of sovereign debt of nations such as greece spain italy ireland or portugal continues to decline if additional countries default on their debt or if emerging regulatory requirements such as basel iii require institutions to alter their capital structures these potential constraints could alter the ability of customers or potential customers to purchase our services and thus could have a significant impact on our future growth and profitability 

potential customers may be reluctant to switch to a new vendor which may adversely affect our growth 

for banks and other potential customers of our financial information software and services switching from one vendor of bank core processing or related software and services or from an internallydeveloped system to a new vendor is a significant undertaking many potential customers perceive potential disadvantages such as loss of accustomed functionality increased costs including conversion costs and business disruption as a result potential customers may resist change we seek to overcome this resistance through value enhancing strategies such as a defined conversion process system integration including bundling additional services and making ongoing investments to enhance the functionality of our software however there can be no assurance that our strategies for overcoming potential customers’ reluctance to change vendors will be successful and this resistance may adversely affect our growth 

the sales and implementation cycles for many of our software and service offerings can be lengthy and require significant investment from both our customers and fis if we fail to close sales or if a customer chooses not to complete an installation after expending significant time and resources to do so our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 

the sales and associated deployment of many of our software or service offerings often involve significant capital commitments by our customers andor fis potential customers generally commit significant resources to an evaluation of available software and services and require us to expend substantial time effort and money educating them prior to sales further as part of the sale or deployment of our software and services customers may also require fis to perform significant related services to complete a proof of concept or custom development to meet their needs all of the aforementioned activities may expend significant funds and management resources and ultimately the customer may determine not to close the sale or 

complete the implementation if we are unsuccessful in closing sales or if the customer decides not to complete an implementation after we expend significant funds and management resources or we experience delays it could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

failure to obtain new clients or renew client contracts on favorable terms could result in a lower number of clients and adversely affect results of operations and financial condition 

we may face pricing pressure in obtaining and retaining our larger clients larger clients may be able to seek price reductions from us when they renew a contract when a contract is extended or when the clients business has significant volume changes further our smaller and midsize clients may exert pricing pressure due to pricing competition or other economic needs or pressures being experienced by the customer on some occasions this pricing pressure results in lower revenue from a client than we had anticipated based on our previous agreement with that client this reduction in revenue could result in an adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

further failure to renew client contracts on favorable terms could have an adverse effect on our business our contracts with customers generally run for several years and provide for early termination fees terms are generally renegotiated prior to the end of a contracts term if we are not successful in achieving a high rate of contract renewals on favorable terms our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

we may experience defects development delays installation difficulties system failure or other service disruptions with respect to our technology solutions which would harm our business and reputation and expose us to potential liability 

many of our services are based on sophisticated software and computing systems and we may encounter delays when developing new technology solutions and services further the technology solutions underlying our services have occasionally contained and may in the future contain undetected errors or defects when first introduced or when new versions are released in addition we may experience difficulties in installing or integrating our technologies on platforms used by our customers or our customers may cancel a project after we have expended significant effort and resources to complete an installation finally our systems and operations could be exposed to damage or interruption from fire natural disaster power loss telecommunications failure unauthorized entry and computer viruses defects in our technology solutions errors or delays in the processing of electronic transactions or other difficulties could result in i interruption of business operations ii delay in market acceptance iii additional development and remediation costs iv diversion of technical and other resources v loss of customers vi negative publicity or vii exposure to liability claims any one or more of the foregoing could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations although we attempt to limit our potential liability through controls including system redundancies security controls application development and testing controls and disclaimers and limitationofliability provisions in our license and customer agreements we cannot be certain that these measures will always be successful in preventing disruption or limiting our liability 

the doddfrank act may result in business changes for our customers that could have an adverse effect on our financial condition revenues results of operations or prospects for future growth and overall business  

our customers and as a result our associated software and services are required to comply with numerous regulations the doddfrank act and associated durbin amendment were passed and signed into law in 2010 the doddfrank act represents a comprehensive overhaul of the regulations governing the financial services industry within the united states established the consumer financial protection bureau and will require this and other federal agencies to implement many new regulations which have the potential to increase the amount and types of regulation on areas of our business that were not previously regulated the durbin amendment established interchange fee ceilings and allowed merchants to direct routing of transactions both effective october 1 2011 and established provisions that require all issuers to utilize at least two unaffiliated networks for processing effective april 1 2012 these changes may alter the nature or type of card programs offered by our customers which could have an ongoing impact on our future growth or revenue for debit cards or other card programs further these changes could impact the volume or dollar amount of transactions that are routed through our network which could alter the number of transactions that we process and impact our future processing fee revenue 

several new regulations and rules will be written and implemented as directed by the aforementioned legislation and these new rules and regulations will require our customers or potential customers to comply with new requirements and could require fis to directly comply with new regulations see item i business government regulation for more information regarding certain of these new requirements these new requirements could result in the need for fis to make capital investments to modify our products and services to facilitate our customers and potential customers compliance as well as to deploy additional processes or reporting to comply with new regulations further requirements of the new regulations could result in changes in our customers business practices and those of other marketplace participants that may alter the delivery of services to consumers which could impact the demand for our software and services as well as alter the type or volume of transactions 

that we process on behalf of our customers as a result the new legislation could have an adverse impact on our financial condition revenues results of operations prospects for future growth and overall business 

many of our customers are subject to a regulatory environment and to industry standards that may change in a manner that reduces the number of transactions in which our customers engage and therefore reduces our revenues 

our customers are subject to a number of government regulations and industry standards with which our services must comply our customers must ensure that our services and related products work within the extensive and evolving regulatory and industry requirements applicable to them federal state foreign or industry authorities could adopt laws rules or regulations affecting our customers businesses that could lead to increased operating costs and could reduce the convenience and functionality of our products and services possibly resulting in reduced market acceptance in addition action by regulatory authorities relating to credit availability data usage privacy or other related regulatory developments could have an adverse effect on our customers and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

regulations enacted by the consumer financial protection bureau may require fis to enact new business practices which may require capital investment which could impact our future operating results 

the consumer financial protection bureau regulates financial and nonfinancial institutions and providers to those organizations the bureau is establishing its regulatory agenda and will likely pass additional rules for regulating nonfinancial institution providers to ensure adequate protection of consumer privacy and to ensure consumers are not impacted by deceptive business practices the impact of these rules may require fis or its subsidiaries to be subject to additional regulation and adopt additional business practices that could require additional capital expenditures or impact our operating results 

our revenues from the sale of services to members of visa mastercard american express discover and other similar organizations are dependent upon our continued certification and sponsorship and the loss or suspension of certification or sponsorship could adversely affect our business 

in order to provide our card processing services we must be certified including applicable sponsorship by visa mastercard american express discover and other similar organizations these certifications are dependent upon our continued adherence to the standards of the issuing bodies and sponsoring member banks the member financial institutions some of which are our competitors set the standards with which we must comply if we fail to comply with these standards we could be fined our certifications could be suspended or our registration could be terminated the suspension or termination of our certifications or any changes in the rules and regulations governing visa mastercard american express discover or other similar organizations could prevent our registration or otherwise limit our ability to provide services which could result in a reduction in revenue or increased costs of operation which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business 

changes in card association and debit network fees or products could increase costs or otherwise limit our operations 

from time to time card associations and debit networks increase the interchange fees that they charge it is possible that competitive pressures will result in our absorption of a portion of such increases in the future which would increase our operating costs reduce our profit margin and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operation furthermore the rules and regulations of the various card associations and networks prescribe certain capital requirements any increase in the capital level required would further limit our use of capital for other purposes 

interchange fees and related practices have been receiving significant legal and regulatory scrutiny worldwide the resulting regulatory changes that could occur from proposed regulations could alter the fees charged by card associations and debit networks worldwide the impact from the regulations could change from time to time and the resulting changes in fees could impact the card issuance or services offered by our customers which could have an adverse impact on our business or financial condition due to reductions or changes in types of transactions processed on behalf of our customers see item i business government regulation for more information 

if we fail to comply with applicable regulations or to meet regulatory expectations our business results of operations or financial condition could be adversely impacted 

the majority of our data processing services for financial institutions are not directly subject to federal or state regulations specifically applicable to financial institutions such as banks thrifts and credit unions however as a provider of services to these financial institutions our data processing operations are examined on a regular basis by various federal and state regulatory authorities if we fail to comply with any applicable regulations or guidelines for operations of a data services 

provider we could be subject to regulatory actions or regulatory rating changes may not meet contractual obligations or suffer harm to our client relationships or reputation failure to meet the aforementioned requirements or to adapt to new requirements at the federal state or international level could inhibit our ability to retain existing customers or obtain new customers which could have an adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition 

in addition to our data processing services described above we also have business operations that store process or transmit consumer information or have direct relationships with consumers that are obligated to comply with regulations including but not limited to the federal fair credit reporting act the federal fair debt collection practices act and applicable privacy requirements further our international businesses must comply with applicable laws such as the us foreign corrupt practices act failure to maintain compliance with or adapt to changes in any of the aforementioned requirements could result in fines penalties or regulatory actions that could have an adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition 

security breaches our own failure to comply with laws and regulations or industry security requirements imposed on providers of services to financial institutions and card processing services could harm our business by disrupting our delivery of services and damaging our reputation and could result in a breach of one or more client contracts 

as part of our business we electronically receive process store and transmit sensitive business information of our customers in addition we collect personal consumer data such as names and addresses social security numbers drivers license numbers cardholder data and payment history records to support our customers transaction processing as well as part of our check authorization and collection businesses  the uninterrupted operation of our information systems and the confidentiality of the customerconsumer information that resides on such systems are critical to our successful operation if we fail to maintain an adequate security infrastructure adapt to emerging security threats or implement sufficient security standards and technology to protect against security breaches the confidentiality of the information we secure could be compromised unauthorized access to our computer systems or databases could result in the theft or publication of confidential information the deletion or modification of records or could otherwise cause interruptions in our operations these risks are increased when we transmit information over the internet and due to increasing security risks posed by organized crime and politically motivated hackers 

as previously disclosed in the first quarter of 2011 we experienced a cyberincident during which intruders gained unauthorized access to fis network during the incident the intruders moved across a number of information technology environments viewed and downloaded information and ultimately executed approximately 130 million in unauthorized atm transactions through our sunrise prepaid card platform resulting in a loss to fis we are aware of no evidence that any of our clients or their customers suffered any direct financial loss as a result of the 2011 cyberincident 

during the 2011 cyberincident the attackers also engaged in tactics and techniques designed to obscure their movements and to prevent a full recreation of their activities nonetheless it was the opinion of the cybersecurity consultant we retained in march 2011 and representatives of law enforcement that the attackers were focused on the theft of money from the sunrise prepaid platform if additional information regarding the incident is discovered our current understanding of the attackers activities during the incident could change and the result could potentially have a material adverse effect on us new cyberincidents or additional cyberincidents as a result of the previous unauthorized access incident could have a material adverse impact on us in addition while there is no pending litigation against us related to this cyberincident litigation may result 

in late february 2012 the federal agencies that regulate financial institutions and provide regulatory oversight for fis issued a confidential exam report related to our information security risk management and internal audit functions we responded to this report and described the actions that we have taken and will take to improve these functions the regulatory agencies distributed a letter to our clients in march 2012 describing the enhancements they had requested in our information security risk management and internal audit functions this letter acknowledged our commitment to address these requests expeditiously in the fourth quarter of 2012 the regulatory agencies completed the fieldwork for their regularly scheduled examination of fis a final report is pending at the time of this filing 

after hiring our new chief information security officer we commissioned an additional thirdparty factual investigation to analyze the 2011 cyberincident comprehensively and objectively this investigation is not yet complete however additional information has been provided to us by the investigators indicating that limited data affecting a small number of our customers may have been accessed or was accessed during the 2011 cyberincident we are in the process of communicating this information with the affected customers we do not expect that this additional information and the communication thereof to our customers will have a material adverse effect on the company although we cannot predict this with certainty it is possible that additional information regarding the 2011 cyberincident could be discovered and our current understanding of the 

attackers focus and activities during the incident could change either of which could potentially have a material adverse effect on the company 

further although we have implemented significant enhancements in our security systems and environments since the attack and are continuing to make improvements we are unable to predict with certainty what if any further communications our regulators will have with our regulated financial institution clients or will require us to have with our clients we are also unable to predict the effect that any future fis communications to our clients may have on our business any future actions from our regulators or clients could have a material adverse impact on our business 

further as a provider of services to financial institutions and card processing services we are bound by the same limitations on disclosure of the information we receive from our customers as apply to the customers themselves if we fail to comply with these regulations and industry security requirements we could be exposed to suits for breach of contract governmental proceedings or the imposition of fines or prohibitions on card processing services in addition if more restrictive privacy laws rules or industry security requirements are adopted in the future on the federal or state level or by a specific industry body they could have an adverse impact on us through increased costs or restrictions on business processes any inability to prevent security or privacy breaches or the perception that such breaches may occur could cause our existing customers to lose confidence in our systems and terminate their agreements with us inhibit our ability to attract new customers andor result in increasing regulation or other adverse consequences from the government agencies that regulate our business 

  

misappropriation of our intellectual property and proprietary rights could impair our competitive position 

our ability to compete depends upon proprietary systems and technology despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our services or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary policing unauthorized use of our proprietary rights is difficult we cannot make any assurances that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of technology or that the agreements entered into for that purpose will be enforceable effective trademark service mark copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our applications and services are made available online misappropriation of our intellectual property or potential litigation concerning such matters could have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 

if our applications or services are found to infringe the proprietary rights of others we may be required to change our business practices and may also become subject to significant costs and monetary penalties 

as our information technology applications and services develop we are increasingly subject to infringement claims any claims whether with or without merit could i be expensive and timeconsuming to defend ii result in an injunction or other equitable relief which could cause us to cease making licensing or using applications that incorporate the challenged intellectual property iii require us to redesign our applications if feasible iv divert management’s attention and resources and v require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements in order to obtain the right to use necessary technologies or pay damages resulting from any infringing use 

we face liability to our merchant customers if checks that we have guaranteed are dishonored by the check writer’s bank 

if a check that we have guaranteed is dishonored by the check writer’s bank we must reimburse our merchant customer for the check’s face value and pursue collection of the amount from the check writer in some cases we recognize a liability to our merchant customers for estimated check returns and a receivable for amounts we estimate we will recover from the check writers based on historical experience and other relevant factors the estimated check returns and recovery amounts are subject to the risk that actual amounts returned may exceed our estimates and actual amounts recovered by us may be less than our estimates 

lack of system integrity fraudulent payments credit quality related to funds settlement or the availability of clearing services could result in a financial loss 

we settle funds on behalf of financial institutions other businesses and consumers and receive funds from clients card issuers payment networks and consumers on a daily basis for a variety of transaction types transactions facilitated by us include debit card credit card electronic bill payment transactions ach payments and check clearing that supports consumers financial institutions and other businesses these payment activities rely upon the technology infrastructure that facilitates the verification of activity with counterparties the facilitation of the payment as well as the detection or prevention of fraudulent payments if the continuity of operations integrity of processing or ability to detect or prevent fraudulent payments were compromised this could result in a financial loss to us in addition we rely on various financial institutions to provide ach services in support of funds settlement for certain of our products if we are unable to obtain such ach services 

in the future that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations in addition we may issue credit to consumers financial institutions or other businesses as part of the funds settlement a default on this credit by a counterparty could result in a financial loss to us furthermore if one of our customers for which we facilitate settlement suffers a fraudulent event due to an error of their controls we may suffer a financial loss if the customer does not have sufficient capital to cover the loss 

our business is subject to the risks of international operations including movements in foreign currency exchange rates 

our international operations represent approximately 20  of total 2012  revenues which are largely conducted in currencies other than the us dollar including the brazilian real british pound and euro as a result our financial condition and operating results could be significantly affected by risks associated with international activities including economic and labor conditions political instability tax laws including us taxes on foreign subsidiaries differences in business practices and changes in the value of the us dollar versus local currencies in addition we are less wellknown internationally than in the united states have less experience with local business conditions and may face challenges in successfully managing small operations located far from our headquarters because of the greater difficulty in overseeing and guiding operations from a distance 

as we expand our international operations more of our customers may pay us in foreign currencies conducting business in currencies other than us dollars subjects us to fluctuations in currency exchange rates our primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to foreign currencies in brazil europe australia and parts of asia the us dollar value of our net investments in foreign operations the periodic conversion of foreigndenominated earnings to the us dollar our reporting currency our results of operations and in some cases cash flows could be adversely affected in a material manner by movements in foreign currency exchange rates these risks could cause an adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations 

failure to attract and retain skilled technical employees or senior management personnel could harm our ability to grow 

our future success depends upon our ability to attract and retain highlyskilled technical personnel because the development of our products and services requires knowledge of computer hardware operating system software system management software and application software our technical personnel must be proficient in a number of disciplines competition for such technical personnel is intense and our failure to hire and retain talented personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

our future growth will also require sales and marketing financial and administrative personnel to develop and support new products and services to enhance and support current products and services and to expand operational and financial systems there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain the necessary personnel to accomplish our growth strategies and we may experience constraints that could adversely affect our ability to satisfy client demand in a timely fashion 

our ability to maintain compliance with applicable laws rules and regulations and to manage and monitor the risks facing our business relies upon the ability to maintain skilled compliance security risk and audit professionals competition for such skillsets is intense and our failure to hire and retain talented personnel could have an adverse effect on our internal control environment and impact our operating results 

our senior management team has significant experience in the financial services industry either at fis or with clients or competitors and the loss of this leadership could have an adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition further the loss of this leadership may have an adverse impact on senior managements ability to provide effective oversight and strategic direction for all key functions within the company which could impact our future business operating results and financial condition 

       we are the subject of various legal proceedings that could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability   

       we are involved in various litigation matters including in some cases classaction and patent infringement litigation and also are involved in or the subject of governmental or regulatory agency inquiries or investigations from time to time if we are unsuccessful in our defense in the litigation matters or compliance with any governmental or regulatory rules we may be forced to pay damages or fines andor change our business practices any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

 unfavorable resolution of tax contingencies could adversely affect our tax expense 

our tax returns and positions are subject to review and audit by federal state local and international taxing authorities an unfavorable outcome to a tax audit could result in higher tax expense and could negatively impact our effective tax rate financial position results of operations and cash flows in the current andor future periods 

     risks related to business combinations and ventures 

we have a substantial investment in our brazilian venture and drive significant revenue through that venture that would be lost and result in significant termination costs if our venture partner were to terminate the agreement 

        revenue attributable to our brazilian venture partner banco bradesco accounted for 2876 million  in 2012  the contract that we have with our brazilian venture partner allows for the termination of the contract at any point during the 10year term which ends september 30 2020 this risk of contract termination is mitigated by guaranteed performance targets and minimum payments that would be triggered upon the event of an early termination these payments have been established based on fis expected rate of return for the contract over a 10year period the required payments and buyouts decline each year and are further reduced by returns in excess of the expected returns for the contract and reduce the overall barrier to exiting the venture if our partner were to exit the agreement this could have a significant impact on our future revenue and growth for further detail on our brazilian venture see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements 

    additionally we employ approximately 10200 employees in brazil who would have the ability to file labor claims if their employment is terminated if our brazilian venture partner were to terminate the agreement we may be subject to labor claims filed by employees of the brazilian venture these claims if realized could result in a significant cost and impact to our earnings 

        we have substantial investments in recorded goodwill and other intangible assets as a result of prior acquisitions and a severe or extended economic downturn could cause these investments to become impaired requiring writedowns that would reduce our operating income 

as of december 31 2012  goodwill aggregated to 83815 million  or 619  of total assets and other indefinite lived intangible assets aggregated to 813 million  or 06  of total assets current accounting rules require goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets to be assessed for impairment at least annually or whenever changes in circumstances indicate potential impairment factors that may be considered a change in circumstance include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results a significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization and negative industry or economic trends the results of our 2012  annual assessment of the recoverability of goodwill indicated that the fair values of the company’s reporting units were in excess of the carrying values of those reporting units and thus no goodwill impairment existed as of december 31 2012  likewise the fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets was also in excess of the carrying value of those assets as of december 31 2012  however if worldwide or united states economic conditions decline significantly with negative impacts to bank spending and consumer behavior  or if other business or market changes impact our outlook  the carrying amount of our goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets may no longer be recoverable and we may be required to record an impairment charge which would have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

as of december 31 2012  intangible assets with definite useful lives aggregated to 14949 million  or 110  of total assets current accounting rules require intangible assets with definite useful lives to be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable factors that may be considered a change in circumstance include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results a significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization and negative industry or economic trends 

we will continue to monitor the fair value of our intangible assets as well as our market capitalization and the impact of any economic downturn on our business to determine if there is an impairment in future periods 

risks related to our indebtedness 

losses consolidations and failures in the financial services industry may impact our ability to borrow funds or the ability of our lenders to fulfill their obligations under our interest rate swap agreements 

some financial institutions continue to be challenged by negative operating results in certain cases these negative operating results have led to financial institution failures andor consolidations as a result lenders may become insolvent or 

further tighten lending standards which could in turn make it more difficult or impossible for lenders to perform their obligations under our interest rate swap agreements or for us to borrow under our revolving loan obtain financing on favorable terms or obtain financing or interest rate swap agreements at all our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if a financial institution fails to fulfill its obligations under our interest rate swap agreements or we are unable to draw funds under our revolving loan or obtain other costeffective financing 

our existing levels of debt and debt service requirements may adversely affect our financial condition or operational flexibility and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our outstanding indebtedness 

as of december 31 2012  we had total debt of approximately 43855 million  this level of debt could have adverse consequences for our business financial condition operating results and operational flexibility including the following i the debt level may cause us to have difficulty borrowing money in the future for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions or other purposes ii our debt level may limit operational flexibility and our ability to pursue business opportunities and implement certain business strategies iii some of our debt has a variable rate of interest which exposes us to the risk of increased interest rates iv we have a higher level of debt than some of our competitors or potential competitors which may cause a competitive disadvantage and may reduce flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions including increased competition and vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  v there are significant maturities on our debt that we may not be able to fulfill or that may be refinanced at higher rates and vi  if we fail to satisfy our obligations under our outstanding debt or fail to comply with the financial or other restrictive covenants contained in the indenture governing our senior notes or our credit facility an event of default could result that could cause all of our debt to become due and payable 

the covenants relating to our notes and the fis credit agreement are limited and do not prohibit us from incurring additional debt or taking other actions that could exacerbate the risks described in the preceding risk factor or otherwise negatively impact holders of our notes 

we may be able to incur substantially more debt in the future although the indenture governing our notes and the agreements governing the fis credit agreement as both are defined in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements and other indebtedness each contain restrictions on our incurrence of additional indebtedness these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions and under certain circumstances indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial as of december 31 2012  we had approximately 10229 million  of borrowing capacity available under our existing fis credit agreement to the extent new debt is added to our current levels the risks described above could substantially increase

the following section discusses management’s view of the financial condition and results of operations of fis and its consolidated subsidiaries as of december 31 2012  and 2011  and for the years ended december 31 2012  2011  and 2010  

this section should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes of fis included elsewhere in this annual report this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forwardlooking statements see “forwardlooking statements” and “risk factors” for a discussion of the uncertainties risks and assumptions associated with these forwardlooking statements that could cause future results to differ materially from those reflected in this section 

overview 

fis is a leading global provider dedicated to banking and payments technologies with a long history deeply rooted in the financial services sector fis serves more than 14000 institutions in over 100 countries headquartered in jacksonville florida fis employs more than 35000 people worldwide and holds leadership positions in payment processing and banking solutions providing software services and outsourcing of the technology that drives financial institutions fis topped the 2012 and 2011 annual fintech 100 list is a member of the fortune 500 us and of standard and poor’s sp 500 ®  index we have four reporting segments fsg psg isg and corporate and other a description of these segments is included above in item 1 business and the results of operations of our segments are discussed below in segment results of operations 

business trends and conditions 

       our revenue is derived from a combination of recurring services professional services and software license fees recurring services which have historically represented approximately 80 of our revenue are provided under multiyear contracts that contribute relative stability to our revenue stream however a significant portion of these recurring revenues are derived from transaction processing fees that fluctuate with the level of deposit and card transactions associated with consumer and commercial activity sales of software licenses and professional services are less predictable and a portion can be regarded as discretionary spending by our customers we continually seek opportunities to enhance revenues and to manage our costs and capital expenditures prudently in light of any shifting revenue trends and in response to broader economic conditions 

  

we acquired capco in december 2010 to broaden our capabilities to provide strategic and business transformation consulting while capco has generated increased revenues the lower profit margin realized for professional services as compared to our other solutions has resulted in profit margin compression the addition of capco has also reduced the relative proportion of our recurring revenue stream   

as the payment market continues to evolve from paperbased to electronic we continue to add new services responsive to this trend card transactions continue to increase as a percentage of total pointofsale payments which fuels continuing demand for cardrelated services in recent years we have added a variety of storedvalue card types internet banking mobile solutions and electronic bill presentmentpayment services as well as a number of card enhancement and loyaltyreward programs the common goal of these offerings continues to be convenience and security for the consumer coupled with value to the financial institution the evolution to electronic transactions also intensifies the vulnerability to fraud increasing the demand for our risk management solutions at the same time the use of checks continues to decline as a percentage of total payments which negatively impacts our check warranty and itemprocessing businesses 

we compete for both licensing and outsourcing business and thus are affected by the decisions of financial institutions to utilize our services under an outsourced arrangement or to process inhouse under a software license and maintenance agreement as a provider of outsourcing solutions we benefit from multiyear recurring revenue streams which help moderate the effects of yeartoyear economic changes on our results of operations one of the current trends in the financial services industry from which we are benefiting is the migration by our clients to an outsourced model to improve their profitability 

while we are cautious regarding broader economic improvement we expect banks to continue investing in new technology and believe we are well positioned to capitalize as the overall market continues to recover we anticipate consolidation within the banking industry will continue including additional bank failures and continuing merger and acquisition activity as a whole consolidation activity is detrimental to our business however consolidation resulting from specific merger and acquisition transactions may be beneficial or detrimental to our business when consolidations occur merger partners often operate disparate systems licensed from competing service providers the newly formed entity generally 

makes a determination to migrate its core and payments systems to a single platform when a financial institution processing client is involved in a consolidation we may benefit by expanding the use of our services if such services are chosen to survive the consolidation and support the newly combined entity conversely we may lose market share if we are providing services to both entities or we are not the merging parties provider of core or payment processing or if a customer of ours is involved in a consolidation and our services are not chosen to survive the consolidation and support the newly combined entity it is also possible that larger financial institutions resulting from consolidation would have greater leverage in negotiating terms or could decide to perform inhouse some or all of the services that we currently provide or could provide we seek to mitigate the risks of consolidations by offering other competitive services to take advantage of specific opportunities at the surviving company 

the acquisition of mi bank by bmo harris bank both of whom are customers of fis is a consolidation that will have a financial impact on the company we disclosed in our june 30 2012 form 10q that we estimated a decline in annual ebitda run rate of approximately 600 million and that we expected the 2013 impact to be approximately half that amount we now expect that the 2013 impact will be substantially offset by termination and settlement fees additional professional services from bmo harris bank and other activities expected to occur with bmo harris bank we will continue to work towards reducing the impact in 2014 and beyond by expanding services to bmo harris bank adding new customers and selling additional products and services to existing clients 

the doddfrank act and associated durbin amendment were passed and signed into law in 2010 the doddfrank act represents a comprehensive overhaul of the regulations governing the financial services industry within the united states established the new federal consumer financial protection bureau and will require this and other federal agencies to implement many new regulations regulations under the durbin amendment released by the federal reserve in june 2011 mandate a cap on debit transaction interchange fees on cards issued by financial institutions with assets greater than 100 billion this legislated interchange fee cap has the potential to alter the type andor volume of cardbased transactions that we process on behalf of our customers but has had an insignificant impact thus far as we continue to monitor the market participants actions we believe we are competitively positioned to offset or take advantage of any potential shifts in payment transaction volume as we offer multiple payment solutions and options to our clients the network exclusivity provisions of the durbin amendment which require all debit card issuers to have at least two unaffiliated networks for purposes of processing signature debit and pin debit transactions favorably impacted transaction volumes in our nyce pin debit network in 2012 however market participants actions may positively or negatively impact transaction volumes in the future in order for our products and services to comply with these new regulations and enable our customers to effectively compete in the marketplace we may need to make additional capital investments to modify our solutions further the requirements of the new regulations and the timing of their effective dates could result in changes in our customers business practices that may alter their delivery of services to consumers and the timing of their investment decisions which could change the demand for our software and services as well as alter the type or volume of transactions that we process on behalf of our customers 

notwithstanding challenging global economic conditions our international business continued to experience growth across most major regions during the year ended december 31 2012  including europe and brazil the majority of our european revenue is generated by clients in germany france and the united kingdom those countries encountering the most significant economic challenges including spain italy greece ireland and portugal account for less than 2 of our international revenue base and less than 05 of our consolidated revenue 

information security 

globally attacks on information technology systems continue to grow in frequency complexity and sophistication such attacks have become a point of focus for individuals businesses and governmental entities the objectives of these attacks include among other things gaining unauthorized access to systems to facilitate financial fraud disrupt operations cause denial of service events corrupt data and steal nonpublic sensitive information fis is not immune to such attacks as part of our business we electronically receive process store and transmit a wide range of confidential information including but not limited to sensitive information of our customers and personal consumer data we also operate payment cash access and prepaid card systems 

as previously disclosed in the first quarter of 2011 we experienced a cyberincident during which intruders gained unauthorized access to fis network during the incident the intruders moved across a number of information technology environments viewed and downloaded information and ultimately executed approximately 130 million  in unauthorized atm transactions through our sunrise prepaid card platform resulting in a loss to fis we are aware of no evidence that any of our clients or their customers suffered any direct financial loss as a result of the 2011 cyberincident 

during the 2011 cyberincident the attackers also engaged in tactics and techniques designed to obscure their movements and to prevent a full recreation of their activities to date we are aware of no evidence of any misuse of any client 

information gained by the intruders from our information technology systems environments this lack of evidence is consistent with the opinion of the cybersecurity consultant we retained in march 2011 and representatives of law enforcement that the attackers were focused on the theft of money from the sunrise prepaid platform 

since the incident we have been taking significant steps to improve our information security including but not limited to 

   

in late february 2012 the federal agencies that regulate financial institutions and provide regulatory oversight for fis issued a confidential exam report related to our information security risk management and internal audit functions we responded to this report and described the actions that we have taken and will take to improve these functions the regulatory agencies distributed a letter to our clients in march 2012 describing the enhancements they had requested in our information security risk management and internal audit functions fis believes that it has made substantial progress in implementing all of these requested enhancements several of which have been completed throughout 2013 fis will continue to focus on completing these and other enhancements identified since march 2012 

in addition in 2012 we engaged a thirdparty expert on behalf of our clients to perform an independent review of our progress in improving our information security risk management and internal audit initiatives the experts report dated november 30 2012 was posted on our client communications portal as part of its review engagement the expert confirmed the status of our progress as stated to our clients and the regulatory agencies up to that date in enhancing our information security risk management and internal audit programs 

after hiring our new chief information security officer we commissioned an additional third party factual investigation to analyze the 2011 cyberincident which is nearing completion as part of this investigation the investigators provided us with additional information indicating that limited data affecting a small number of our customers may have been accessed or in some cases was accessed during the 2011 cyberincident we are in the process of communicating this information with the affected customers and showing the steps that we have taken to improve our information security systems we do not expect that this additional information and the communication thereof to our customers will have a material adverse effect on the company 

 it is possible that additional information regarding the 2011 cyberincident could be discovered and our current understanding of the attackers focus and activities during the incident could change either of which could potentially have a material adverse effect on the company 

we are continuing to work closely with and communicate to our clients about the 2011 cyberincident including with respect to the additional information resulting from the ongoing investigation we are also continuing to focus on improving our internal information security and risk management functions across the company and assisting our customers in doing the same we increased the amounts spent on information security in 2012 due to the increased frequency and the evolving nature of cyberincidents we expect to continue to implement enhancements to protect the security of our information technology systems and data as well as the information technology data of our clients that we possess 

critical accounting policies 

the accounting policies described below are those we consider critical in preparing our consolidated financial statements these policies require management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures with respect to contingent liabilities and assets at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods actual amounts could differ from those estimates see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed description of the significant accounting policies that have been followed in preparing our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

the company generates revenues from the delivery of bank processing credit and debit card processing services other payment processing services professional services software licensing and software related services and products revenues are recognized when evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred fees are fixed or determinable and collection is considered probable we are frequently a party to multiple concurrent contracts with the same customer these situations require judgment to determine whether the individual contracts should be aggregated or evaluated separately for purposes of revenue recognition in making this determination we consider the timing of negotiating and executing the contracts whether the different elements of the contracts are interdependent and whether any of the payment terms of the contracts are interrelated due to the large number broad nature and average size of individual contracts we are party to the impact of judgments and assumptions that we apply in recognizing revenue for any single contract is not likely to have a material effect on our consolidated operations or financial position however the broader accounting policy assumptions that we apply across similar arrangements or classes of customers could significantly influence the timing and amount of revenue recognized in our historical and future results of operations or financial position additional information about our revenue recognition policies is included in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

the company analyzes trade accounts receivable by considering historical bad debts customer creditworthiness current economic trends changes in customer payment terms and collection trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts any change in the assumptions used may result in an additional allowance for doubtful accounts being recognized in the period in which the change occurs the allowance for doubtful accounts was 199 million  and 331 million  as of december 31 2012  and 2011  respectively the decrease in 2012 is attributable to resolution of a number of specifically reserved accounts as well as enhanced collection management 

provision for check guarantee losses 

in our check guarantee business if a guaranteed check presented to a merchant customer is dishonored by the check writer’s bank we reimburse our merchant customer for the check’s face value and pursue collection of the amount from the delinquent check writer loss provisions and anticipated recoveries are primarily determined by performing a historical analysis of our check loss and recovery experience and considering other factors that could affect that experience in the future such factors include the general economy the overall industry mix of our customer volumes statistical analysis of check fraud trends within our customer volumes and the quality of returned checks once these factors are considered we establish a rate for check losses that is calculated by dividing the expected check losses by dollar volume processed and a rate for anticipated recoveries that is calculated by dividing the anticipated recoveries by the total amount of related check losses these rates are then applied against the dollar volume processed and check losses respectively each month and charged to cost of revenues the estimated check returns and recovery amounts are subject to the risk that actual amounts returned and recovered may be different than our estimates 

historically such estimation processes have proved to be materially accurate however our projections of probable check guarantee losses and anticipated recoveries are inherently uncertain and as a result we cannot predict with certainty the amount of such items changes in economic conditions the risk characteristics and composition of our customers and other factors could impact our actual and projected amounts we recorded check guarantee losses net of anticipated recoveries excluding service fees of 547 million  680 million  and 694 million  respectively for the years ended december 31 2012  2011  and 2010  the yearoveryear reduction is consistent with the ongoing decline in retail check activity a ten percent difference in our estimated check guarantee loss provisions net of estimated recoveries as of december 31 2012  would have impacted 2012 net earnings by less than 20 million aftertax 

computer software 

computer software includes the fair value of software acquired in business combinations purchased software and capitalized software development costs as of december 31 2012  and 2011  computer software net of accumulated amortization was 8470 million  and 8815 million  respectively purchased software is recorded at cost and amortized using the straightline method over its estimated useful life and software acquired in business combinations is recorded at its fair value and amortized using straightline and accelerated methods over its estimated useful life 

the capitalization of software development costs is governed by fasb asc subtopic 98520 if the software is to be sold leased or otherwise marketed or by fasb asc subtopic 35040 if the software is for internal use after the technological feasibility of the software has been established for software to be marketed or at the beginning of application development for internaluse software software development costs which include salaries and related payroll costs and costs of independent contractors incurred during development are capitalized research and development costs incurred prior to the establishment of technological feasibility for software to be marketed or prior to application development for internaluse software are expensed as incurred software development costs are amortized on a productbyproduct basis commencing on the date of general release of the products for software to be marketed or the date placed in service for internaluse software software development costs for software to be marketed are amortized using the greater of 1 the straightline method over its estimated useful life which ranges from three to 10 years or 2 the ratio of current revenues to total anticipated revenue over its useful life 

in determining useful lives management considers historical results and technological trends that may influence the estimate useful lives for all computer software range from three to 10 years amortization expense for computer software was 1955 million  2094 million  and 1951 million  in 2012  2011  and 2010  respectively included in discontinued operations in the consolidated statement of earnings was amortization expense on computer software of 31 million  45 million  and 77 million  for 2012  2011  and 2010  respectively we also assess the recorded value of computer software for impairment on a regular basis by comparing the carrying value to the estimated future cash flows to be generated by the underlying software asset for software to be marketed there are inherent uncertainties in determining the expected useful life or cash flows to be generated from computer software while we have not historically experienced significant changes in these estimates we could be subject to such changes in the future 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

we are required to allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction at their estimated fair values the estimates used to determine the fair value of longlived assets such as intangible assets are complex and require a significant amount of management judgment we generally engage independent valuation specialists to assist us in making fair value determinations we are also required to estimate the useful lives of intangible assets to determine the amount of acquisitionrelated intangible asset amortization expense to record in future periods we periodically review the estimated useful lives assigned to our definitelived intangible assets to determine whether such estimated useful lives continue to be appropriate additionally we review our indefinitelived intangible assets to determine if there is any change in circumstances that may indicate the asset’s useful life is no longer indefinite 

goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives should not be amortized but shall be tested for impairment annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate potential impairment in 2011 the fasb issued accounting standards update no 201108 asu 201108 testing goodwill for impairment the revised standard allows an entity first to assess qualitatively whether it is more likely than not that a reporting units carrying amount exceeds its fair value referred to in the guidance as step zero if an entity concludes that it is more likely than not that a reporting units fair value is less than its carrying amount that is a likelihood of more than 50 percent the step one quantitative assessment must be performed for that reporting unit asu 201108 provided examples of events and circumstances that should be considered in performing the step zero qualitative assessment including macroeconomic conditions industry and market considerations cost factors overall financial performance events affecting a reporting unit or the entity as a whole and a sustained decrease in share price   

  we assess goodwill for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter using a september 30th measurement date unless circumstances require a more frequent measurement for 2012 primarily for the purpose of refreshing our valuation assumptions we elected to proceed directly to the step one quantitative analysis rather than perform the step zero qualitative assessment in applying the quantitative analysis we determine the fair value of our reporting units based on a weighted average of multiple valuation techniques principally a combination of an income approach and a market approach the income approach calculates a value based upon the present value of estimated future cash flows while the market 

approach utilizes earnings multiples of similarly situated guideline public companies if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the reporting units net assets goodwill is not impaired and further testing is not required based upon the current year results of this test there are no indications of impairment for any of our reporting units 

for 2011 we early adopted the provisions of asu 201108 and began our assessment with the step zero qualitative analysis because there was a substantial excess of fair value over carrying value for each of our reporting units in the 2010 step one analysis in performing the 2011 step zero qualitative analysis examining those factors most likely to affect our valuations we concluded that it remained more likely than not that the fair value of each of our reporting units continued to exceed their carrying amounts consequently we did not perform a step one analysis in 2011 

we also estimate the fair value of acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives and compare this amount to the underlying carrying value annually for the year ended december 31 2012 we did not record any impairment charges for acquired intangible assets during the year ended december 31 2011 we recorded an impairment charge of 91 million related to the capco trademark in north america during the year ended december 31 2010  the portion of the unamortized contract intangible asset recorded at the initiation of the brazilian venture that was attributable to banco santander was deemed impaired due to the exit of banco santander accordingly we recorded a pretax impairment charge of 1403 million  in the third quarter of 2010  additionally in 2010  we recorded a 52 million  impairment of intangible assets related to the discontinued operations of participacoes as discussed in notes 6 and 9 to the consolidated financial statements 

determining the fair value of a reporting unit or acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives involves judgment and the use of significant estimates and assumptions which include assumptions regarding the revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate estimated future cash flows riskadjusted discount rates and future economic and market conditions and other assumptions 

accounting for income taxes 

as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements we are required to determine income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate this process involves estimating actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing recognition of items for income tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred income tax assets and liabilities which are included within the consolidated balance sheets we must then assess the likelihood that deferred income tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely establish a valuation allowance to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase or decrease this allowance in a period we must reflect this increase or decrease as an expense or benefit within income tax expense in the consolidated statements of earnings determination of the income tax expense requires estimates and can involve complex issues that may require an extended period to resolve further changes in the geographic mix of revenues or in the estimated level of annual pretax income can cause the overall effective income tax rate to vary from period to period we believe that our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that we adequately provide for any known tax contingencies we believe the estimates and assumptions used to support our evaluation of tax benefit realization are reasonable however final determination of prioryear tax liabilities either by settlement with tax authorities or expiration of statutes of limitations could be materially different than estimates reflected in assets and liabilities and historical income tax provisions the outcome of these final determinations could have a material effect on our income tax provision net income or cash flows in the period that determination is made 

related party transactions 

we are a party to certain historical related party agreements as discussed in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of part ii of this annual report 

factors affecting comparability 

our consolidated financial statements included in this report that present our financial condition and operating results reflect the following significant transactions 

 

 30 

stock options the repurchased shares were added to treasury stock the recapitalization was funded by incremental debt as outlined under  liquidity and capital resources  financing  

 

as a result of the above transactions the results of operations and earnings per share in the periods covered by the consolidated financial statements may not be directly comparable 

consolidated results of operations 

in millions except per share amounts 



processing and services revenues 

processing and services revenues totaled 58076 million  56256 million  and 51456 million  in 2012  2011  and 2010  respectively the increase in revenue during 2012  of 1820 million  or 32  as compared to 2011  is primarily attributable to increased processing volumes transaction growth and demand for professional and consulting services plus incremental revenues from 2012  acquisitions of 262 million total revenue growth in these areas was partially offset by lower item processing and retail check activity the 2012  period included 1008 million of unfavorable foreign currency impact resulting from a stronger us dollar as compared to 2011  the increase in revenue during 2011  of 4800 million  or 93  as compared to 2010  was primarily attributable to incremental revenues of 3047 million  from 2010  acquisitions increased demand for professional services and increased processing revenues total revenue growth in these areas in 2011  was tempered by lower item processing and retail check activity and the change in reporting certain merchant interchange fees from gross to net revenue recognition as discussed in greater detail under  segment results of operations  the 2011  period also 

included 474 million of favorable foreign currency impact resulting from a weaker us dollar as compared with 2010 the 2010  period was favorably impacted by the recognition of an 833 million  termination fee in connection with banco santander’s exit from the brazilian venture

selling general and administrative expenses 

selling general and administrative expenses totaled 7815 million  6479 million  and 6540 million  for 2012  2011  and 2010  respectively the 2012  increase of 1336 million  as compared to 2011  was primarily due to increased compensation costs and costs to enhance administrative support of operational functions including information security and risk and compliance the compensation costs included 432 million in payments and accelerated vesting of certain stock option and restricted stock grants triggered by changes in responsibility or separation from the company of certain executives in addition the 2011  period benefited from a 223 million  reduction in a contingent consideration liability related to the capco acquisition as addressed in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements the decrease of 61 million  in 2011  as compared to 2010  results primarily from higher expenses included in the 2010  period in connection with our leveraged recapitalization coupled with the 2011  reduction in the capco contingent consideration liability these impacts were partially offset by incremental operating costs in 2011  resulting from 2010  acquisitions other factors impacting the comparison include a 101 million recovery in september 2010  of legal costs previously incurred as the result of a favorable court ruling and the 130 million  loss related to unauthorized activities on the sunrise prepaid card platform recorded in 2011  see note 19 to the consolidated financial statements 

impairment charges 

impairment charges totaled 91 million  and 1549 million  for 2011  and 2010  respectively no impairment charges were taken in 2012  the 2011  charges relate to a reduction in the carrying value of the capco trademark in north america     the 2010  charges relate to impairments resulting from the exit of banco santander from the brazilian venture including 1403 million  representing the portion of the unamortized contract intangible asset recorded at the initiation of the brazilian venture that was attributable to banco santander and the net unamortized balance of 146 million  for certain capitalized software development costs incurred exclusively for use in processing banco santander card activity see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements

total other income expense 

total other income expense was 2480 million  3225 million  and 1849 million  for 2012  2011  and 2010  respectively the primary component of total other income expense is interest expense the decrease of 335 million  in interest expense in 2012  as compared to 2011  resulted from lower borrowing rates combined with a reduction in total debt outstanding the increase of 850 million  in interest expense in 2011  as compared to 2010  resulted from higher overall debt levels as a result of our recapitalization in mid 2010  and higher interest rates 

apart from interest expense 2012  includes 184 million in costs related to the writeoff of certain previously capitalized debt issuance costs resulting from the early pay down of certain debt and related refinancing activities in comparison 2011  included 388 million of debt refinancing expenses including 247 million of previously capitalized debt issuance costs and a 340 million  otherthantemporary impairment of availableforsale securities acquired in conjunction with the acquisition of metavante  the 2010  period included 137 million of debt extinguishment expenses the writeoff of certain previously capitalized debt issuance costs and fees and other expenses relating to our leveraged recapitalization the 2010  period also included the forgiveness of 194 million of notes payable representing additional consideration which was to be paid to the banks in the brazilian venture upon migration of their card portfolios and an extinguishment gain of 57 million from the restructuring of the remaining banco bradesco notes in conjunction with other revisions to the brazilian venture agreements see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements

liquidity and capital resources 

cash requirements 

our ongoing cash requirements include operating expenses income taxes mandatory debt service payments capital expenditures stockholder dividends working capital and timing differences in settlementrelated assets and liabilities and may include discretionary debt service share repurchases and business acquisitions also our cash requirements include payments for labor claims related to fis former item processing and remittance operations in brazil see note 3 in the notes to consolidated financial statements our principal sources of funds are cash generated by operations and borrowings 

as of december 31 2012  we had cash and cash equivalents of 5176 million  and debt of 43855 million  including the current portion of the 5176 million  cash and cash equivalents approximately 2821 million  is held by our foreign entities the majority of our domestic cash and cash equivalents are not available for general corporate purposes due to the timing of settlement activity we expect that cash and cash equivalents plus cash flows from operations over the next twelve months will be sufficient to fund our operating cash requirements and pay principal and interest on our outstanding debt 

we expect to continue to pay quarterly dividends which were increased from 005 to 020 per share per quarter in 2012 on february 12 2013 the board of directors approved an additional increase to 022 per share per quarter beginning with the first quarter of 2013 however the amount declaration and payment of future dividends is at the discretion of the board of directors and depends on among other things our investment opportunities results of operations financial condition cash requirements future prospects and other factors that may be considered relevant by our board of directors including legal and contractual restrictions additionally the payment of cash dividends may be limited by covenants in certain debt agreements a regular quarterly dividend of 022 per common share is payable on march 29 2013 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on march 15 2013

capital expenditures 

our principal capital expenditures are for computer software purchased and internally developed and additions to property and equipment we invested approximately 2961 million  3003 million  and 3140 million  in capital expenditures during 2012  2011  and 2010  respectively we expect to invest approximately 56  of 2013  revenue in capital expenditures

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risks 

tableend 

  market risk 

we are exposed to market risks primarily from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates we use certain derivative financial instruments including interest rate swaps and foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage interest rate and foreign currency risk we do not use derivatives for trading purposes to generate income or to engage in speculative activity 

  interest rate risk 

in addition to existing cash balances and cash provided by operating activities we use fixed rate and variable rate debt to finance our operations we are exposed to interest rate risk on these debt obligations and related interest rate swaps 

the notes as defined in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements represent substantially all of our fixedrate longterm debt obligations the carrying value of the notes was 19500 million  as of december 31 2012  the fair value of the notes was approximately 21382 million  as of december 31 2012  the potential reduction in fair value of the notes from a hypothetical 10  percent increase in market interest rates would not be material to the overall fair value of the debt 

our floating rate longterm debt obligations principally relate to borrowings under the fis credit agreement as also defined in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements an increase of 100 basis points in the libor rate would increase our annual debt service under the fis credit agreement after we include the impact of our interest rate swaps by 93 million  based on principal amounts outstanding as of december 31 2012  we performed the foregoing sensitivity analysis based on the principal amount of our floating rate debt as of december 31 2012  less the principal amount of such debt that was then subject to an interest rate swap converting such debt into fixed rate debt this sensitivity analysis is based solely on 

the principal amount of such debt as of december 31 2012  and does not take into account any changes that occurred in the prior 12 months or that may take place in the next 12 months in the amount of our outstanding debt or in the notional amount of outstanding interest rate swaps in respect of our debt further in this sensitivity analysis the change in interest rates is assumed to be applicable for an entire year for comparison purposes based on principal amounts on floating rate debt outstanding as of december 31 2011  and calculated in the same manner as set forth above an increase of 100 basis points in the libor rate would have increased our annual interest expense after we calculate the impact of our interest rate swaps by 129 million  

we use interest rate swaps for the purpose of managing our interest expense through the mix of fixed rate and floating rate debt during the year ended december 31 2012  the notional amount of our outstanding interest rate swaps increased by 5500 million  as of december 31 2012  we have entered into the following interest rate swap transactions converting a portion of the interest rate exposure on our term and revolving loans from variable to fixed in millions 



 

 we have designated these interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes a portion of the amount included in accumulated other comprehensive earnings is reclassified into interest expense as a yield adjustment as interest payments are made on the term and revolving loans in accordance with the authoritative guidance for fair value measurements the inputs used to determine the estimated fair value of our interest rate swaps are level 2type measurements we considered our own credit risk and the credit risk of the counterparties when determining the fair value of our interest rate swaps 

foreign currency risk 

we are exposed to foreign currency risks that arise from normal business operations these risks include the translation of local currency balances of foreign subsidiaries transaction gains and losses associated with intercompany loans with foreign subsidiaries and transactions denominated in currencies other than a locations functional currency our objective is to minimize our exposure to these risks through a combination of normal operating activities and the use of foreign currency forward exchange contracts contracts are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries 

our exposure to foreign currency exchange risks generally arises from our nonus operations to the extent they are conducted in local currency changes in foreign currency exchange rates affect translations of revenues denominated in currencies other than the us dollar our international operations generated approximately 11805 million  in revenues during the year ended december 31 2012  of which approximately 10092 million  was denominated in currencies other than the us dollar the major currencies to which our revenues are exposed are the brazilian real the euro the british pound sterling and the indian rupee a 10 move in average exchange rates for these currencies assuming a simultaneous and immediate 10 change in all of such rates for the relevant period would have resulted in the following increase or decrease in our reported revenues for the years ended december 31 2012  2011  and 2010  in millions 



the impact on earnings of the foregoing assumed 10 change in each of the periods presented would not have been significant 

 revenue included 1008 million and operating income included 90 million of unfavorable foreign currency impact during 2012  resulting from a stronger us dollar during 2012  compared to 2011  

our foreign exchange risk management policy permits the use of derivative instruments such as forward contracts and options to reduce volatility in our results of operations andor cash flows resulting from foreign exchange rate fluctuations our international operations revenues and expenses are generally denominated in local currency which limits the economic exposure to foreign exchange risk in those jurisdictions we do not enter into foreign currency derivative instruments for trading purposes we have entered into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency exposure to intercompany loans as of december 31 2012  the notional amount of these derivatives was approximately 1156 million  and the fair value was nominal these derivatives are intended to hedge the foreign exchange risks related to intercompany loans but have not been designated as hedges for accounting purposes

research and development 

our research and development activities have related primarily to the design and development of processing systems and related software applications and risk management platforms we expect to continue our practice of investing an appropriate level of resources to maintain enhance and extend the functionality of our proprietary systems and existing software applications to develop new and innovative software applications and systems in response to the needs of our customers and to enhance the capabilities surrounding our outsourcing infrastructure in addition we intend to offer services that are compatible with new and emerging delivery channels 

as part of our research and development process we evaluate current and emerging technology for compatibility with our existing and future software platforms to this end we engage with various hardware and software vendors in evaluation of various infrastructure components where appropriate we use thirdparty technology components in the development of our software applications and service offerings thirdparty software may be used for highly specialized business functions which we may not be able to develop internally within time and budget constraints additionally thirdparty software may be used for commoditytype functions within a technology platform environment in the case of nearly all of our thirdparty software enterprise license agreements exist for the thirdparty component and either alternative suppliers exist or transfer rights exist to 

ensure the continuity of supply as a result we are not materially dependent upon any thirdparty technology components we work with our customers to determine the appropriate timing and approach to introducing technology or infrastructure changes to our applications and services in the years ended december 31 2011  2010  and 2009  approximately 2 to 3 of revenues were invested in research and development efforts excluding amounts capitalized 

government regulation 

our services are subject to a broad range of complex federal state and foreign regulation including federal truthinlending and truthinsavings rules regulation aa unfair or deceptive acts or practices privacy laws usury laws the equal credit opportunity act the electronic funds transfer act the fair credit reporting act the fair debt collection practices act the bank secrecy act the usa patriot act the internal revenue code the employee retirement income security act the health insurance portability and accountability act the community reinvestment act and the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the doddfrank act the compliance of our services with these and other applicable laws and regulations depends on a variety of factors including the manner in which our clients use them our clients are contractually responsible for determining what is required of them under applicable laws and regulations so that we can assist them in their compliance efforts the failure of our services to comply with applicable laws and regulations could result in restrictions on our ability to provide them as well as the imposition of civil fines andor criminal penalties the principal areas of regulation impacting our business are 

 the doddfrank act was enacted and signed into law on july 21 2010 among other provisions this legislation created the consumer financial protection bureau the bureau whose sole focus is to develop implement and with respect to financial institutions with more than 10 billion in assets enforce consumer protection rules promulgated by the bureau including enhanced oversight of nonfinancial institutions providing financial services for financial institutions with less than 10 billion in assets enforcement of the rules will be carried out by such institutions primary federal regulator since some of the regulations implementing the act have not yet been finalized we are uncertain as to what degree the legislation may affect our business in the future 

the housing assistance tax act of 2008 requires among other provisions information reporting obligations on payment settlement entities for calendar years beginning after december 31 2010 this law requires every merchant acquiring entity and thirdparty settlement organization to file information returns for the gross amount of reportable payment transactions for the calendar year and the reportable payment transactions for each month of the calendar year the reportable payment transactions are any transactions in which a payment card is accepted as payment and any thirdparty payment network this law resulted in significant additional form 1099 reporting requirements for fis 

 

 8 

regulations these businesses are also subject to various state local and tribal licensing requirements the financial crimes enforcement network state attorneys general and other agencies have enforcement responsibility over laws relating to money laundering currency transmission and licensing in addition most states have enacted statutes that require entities engaged in money transmission and the sale of stored value cards to register as a money transmitter with that jurisdiction’s banking department 

also included in the doddfrank act is a requirement that the federal reserve board enact regulations governing interchange fees and network fees arising from electronic debit card and reloadable generaluse gift card transactions under the legislation the amount of interchange fees that issuers with more than 10 billion in assets may charge must be “reasonable and proportional” to the cost incurred by the issuer the final rules in section 1075 of the doddfrank act amended the electronic fund transfer act efta by adding a new section 920 regarding interchange transaction fees and rules for payment card transactions as required by the statute the final rule establishes standards for assessing whether debit card interchange fees received by debit card issuers are reasonable and proportional to the costs incurred by issuers for electronic debit transactions under the final rule the maximum permissible interchange fee that a covered issuer may receive for an electronic debit transaction will be the sum of 021 per transaction and five basis points multiplied by the value of the transaction plus a possible 001 fraud prevention adjustment in accordance with the statute issuers that together with their affiliates have assets of less than 10 billion are exempt from the debit card interchange fee standards the provision regarding debit card interchange fees became effective on october 1 2011 

 

 

the fee changes are a significant reduction from the current per transaction average rate for fis interchange fees are primarily passthrough fees and this change would not have a direct impact to our earnings however it is uncertain what the indirect impact will be on fis as our clients are faced with significant revenue reductions from the interchange rate changes moreover since the regulations implementing the doddfrank act have not been finalized we are uncertain as to what degree the legislation may affect our business in the future the proposed regulations do not appear to be intended to directly affect interchange fees applicable to credit card transactions but do prohibit networks from “inhibiting” retailers from setting minimum purchase amounts for use of credit cards as long as the minimum does not discriminate among issuers or networks and the minimum is not greater than 10 

 

the foregoing list of laws and regulations to which our company is subject is not exhaustive and the regulatory framework governing our operations changes continuously enactment of new laws and regulations may increasingly affect the operations of our business directly and indirectly which could result in substantial regulatory compliance costs litigation expense adverse publicity andor loss of revenue 

information security 

as part of our business we electronically receive process store and transmit sensitive business information and payments of our customers fis takes information security and risk management very seriously and is committed to providing industry leading secure and reliable solutions to our clients cyber incidents include gaining unauthorized access to digital systems to facilitate financial fraud disrupt operations corrupt data steal sensitive information or cause denialofservice on web sites globally there have been an increasing number of these types of incidents and it is commonplace to read about such attacks in the media 

fis was the victim of a cyber attack against one of our prepaid clients on our sunrise prepaid card platform in early 2011 which resulted in a financial loss to fis of approximately 130 million at that time we identified information relating to approximately 7200 prepaid accounts that may have been viewed and that three individual cardholders nonpublic information may have been disclosed as a result of the unauthorized activities fis worked with the clients to take appropriate action including blocking and reissuing potentially impacted cards for the affected accounts we have continued to monitor these accounts no financial institutions or financial institution customers suffered any financial loss as a result of the attack 

in response to the sunrise event and in support of our ongoing commitment to information security fis dedicated substantial additional resources in 2011 and continuing into 2012 these resources continue to advance fis information security activities including but not limited to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

     we anticipate that these initiatives will require additional resources we increased the amounts spent on information security in 2011 and will nearly double this spend in 2012 see “risk factors  risks related to our business and operations  security breaches or our own failure to comply with privacy regulations and industry security requirements imposed on providers of services to financial institutions and card processing services could harm our business by disrupting our delivery of services and damaging our reputation”

risk factors 

tableend 

in addition to the normal risks of business we are subject to significant risks and uncertainties including those listed below and others described elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k any of the risks described herein could result in a significant adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

risks related to our markets and industry 

consolidations and business failures in the banking and financial services industry could adversely affect our business by eliminating some of our existing and potential customers and making us more dependent on a more limited number of customers 

there has been and continues to be substantial consolidation activity in the banking and financial services industry in addition many financial institutions that experienced negative operating results including some of our customers have failed 

the consolidations and failures reduce the number of our potential customers and may reduce the number of our customers which could adversely affect our revenues even if the events do not reduce the aggregate activities of the consolidated entities further if our customers fail andor merge with or are acquired by other entities that are not our customers or that use fewer of our services they may discontinue or reduce use of our services it is also possible that larger financial institutions resulting from consolidations would have greater leverage in negotiating terms or could decide to perform inhouse some or all of the services which we currently provide or could provide any of these developments could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

if we fail to adapt our services to changes in technology or in the marketplace or if our ongoing efforts to upgrade our technology are not successful we could lose customers and have difficulty attracting new customers for our services 

the markets for our services are characterized by constant technological changes frequent introductions of new services and evolving industry standards our future success will be significantly affected by our ability to enhance our current services and develop and introduce new services that address the increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers and their clients these initiatives carry the risks associated with any new service development effort including cost overruns delays in delivery and performance issues there can be no assurance that we will be successful in developing marketing and selling new services that meet these changing demands that we will not experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development introduction and marketing of these services or that our new services and their enhancements will adequately meet the demands of the marketplace and achieve market acceptance any of these developments could have an adverse impact on our future revenues andor business prospects 

we operate in a competitive business environment and if we are unable to compete effectively our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 

the market for our services is intensely competitive our competitors vary in size and in the scope and breadth of the services they offer some of our competitors have substantial resources we face direct competition from third parties and since many of our larger potential customers have historically developed their key applications inhouse and therefore view their system requirements from a makeversusbuy perspective we often compete against our potential customers’ inhouse capacities in addition we expect that the markets in which we compete will continue to attract new competitors and new technologies there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors or that the competitive pressures we face in the markets in which we operate will not materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations see item i business competition 

global economic political and other conditions including business cycles and consumer confidence may adversely affect our customers or trends in consumer spending which may adversely impact the demand for our services and our revenue and profitability 

a significant portion of our revenue is derived from transaction processing fees the global transaction processing industries depend heavily upon the overall level of consumer business and government spending any change in economic factors including a sustained deterioration in general economic conditions or consumer confidence particularly in the united 

states or increases in interest rates in key countries in which we operate may adversely affect consumer spending including related consumer debt reduce check writing change credit and debit card usage and may adversely affect our financial performance by reducing the number or average purchase amount of transactions that we service 

constraints within global financial markets or international regulatory requirements could constrain our financial institution customers working or available capital reducing their ability to purchase our services and impacting our future growth and profitability 

a significant number of our customers or potential customers may hold sovereign debt or be subject to emerging international requirements such as basel iii which could require changes in their capitalization and hence free working capital to purchase our services these organizations could have their capital constrained if the value of sovereign debt of nations such as greece spain italy ireland or portugal continues to decline if additional countries default on their debt or if emerging regulatory requirements such as basel iii require institutions to alter their capital structures these potential constraints could alter the ability of customers or potential customers to purchase our services and thus could have a significant impact on our future growth and profitability 

potential customers may be reluctant to switch to a new vendor which may adversely affect our growth 

for banks and other potential customers of our financial information software and services switching from one vendor of bank core processing or related software and services or from an internallydeveloped system to a new vendor is a significant undertaking many potential customers perceive potential disadvantages such as loss of accustomed functionality increased costs including conversion costs and business disruption as a result potential customers may resist change we seek to overcome this resistance through value enhancing strategies such as a defined conversion process system integration including bundling additional services and making ongoing investments to enhance the functionality of our software however there can be no assurance that our strategies for overcoming potential customers’ reluctance to change vendors will be successful and this resistance may adversely affect our growth 

the sales and implementation cycles for many of our software and services can be lengthy and require significant investment from both our customers and fis if we fail to close sales or if a customer chooses not to complete an installation after expending significant time and resources to do so our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 

the sales and associated deployment of many of our software or services often involve significant capital commitments by our customers andor fis potential customers generally commit significant resources to an evaluation of available software and services and require us to expend substantial time effort and money educating them as to the value further as part of the sale or deployment of our software and services customers may also require fis to perform significant related services to complete a proof of concept or custom development to meet their needs all of the aforementioned activities may expend significant funds and management resources and ultimately the customer may determine not to close the sale or complete the implementation if we are unsuccessful in closing sales or if the customer decides not to complete an implementation after expending significant funds and management resources or we experience delays it could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

failure to obtain new clients or renew client contracts on favorable terms could result in a lower number or loss of clients and adversely affect results of operations and financial condition 

we may face pricing pressure in obtaining and retaining our larger clients larger clients may be able to seek price reductions from us when they renew a contract when a contract is extended or when the clients business has significant volume changes further our smaller and midsize clients may exert pricing pressure due to pricing competition or other economic needs or pressures being experienced by the customer on some occasions this pricing pressure results in lower revenue from a client than we had anticipated based on our previous agreement with that client this reduction in revenue could result in an adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

further failure to renew client contracts on favorable terms could have an adverse effect on our business our contracts with customers generally run for several years and provide for early termination fees terms are generally renegotiated prior to the end of a contracts term if we are not successful in achieving a high rate of contract renewals on favorable terms our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

risks related to our business and operations 

we may experience defects development delays installation difficulties system failure or other service disruptions with 

respect to our technology solutions which would harm our business and reputation and expose us to potential liability 

many of our services are based on sophisticated software and computing systems and we may encounter delays when developing new technology solutions and services further the technology solutions underlying our services have occasionally contained and may in the future contain undetected errors or defects when first introduced or when new versions are released in addition we may experience difficulties in installing or integrating our technologies on platforms used by our customers or our customers may cancel a project after we have expended significant effort and resources to complete an installation finally our systems and operations could be exposed to damage or interruption from fire natural disaster power loss telecommunications failure unauthorized entry and computer viruses defects in our technology solutions errors or delays in the processing of electronic transactions or other difficulties could result in i interruption of business operations ii delay in market acceptance iii additional development and remediation costs iv diversion of technical and other resources v loss of customers vi negative publicity or vii exposure to liability claims any one or more of the foregoing could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations although we attempt to limit our potential liability through controls including system redundancies security controls application development and testing controls and disclaimers and limitationofliability provisions in our license and customer agreements we cannot be certain that these measures will always be successful in preventing disruption or limiting our liability 

the doddfrank act may result in business changes for our customers that could have an adverse effect on our financial condition revenues results of operations or prospects for future growth and overall business  

our customers and as a result our associated software and services are required to comply with numerous regulations the doddfrank act and associated durbin amendment were passed and signed into law in 2010 the doddfrank act represents a comprehensive overhaul of the financial services industry within the united states establishes the new consumer financial protection bureau and will require this and other federal agencies to implement many new regulations including the potential to increase the amount and types of regulation on areas of our business that were not previously regulated the durbin amendment established interchange fee ceilings and allows merchants to direct routing of transactions both effective october 1 2011 and establishes provisions which require all issuers to utilize at least two unaffiliated networks for processing which will be effective april 1 2012 these changes may alter the nature or type of card programs offered by our customers which could have an ongoing impact to our future growth or revenue for debit cards or other card programs further these changes could impact the volume or dollar amount of transactions that are routed through our network which could alter the number of transactions that we process and could have an impact on our future processing fee revenue 

several new regulations and rules will be written and implemented as directed by the aforementioned legislation throughout 2012 and beyond and these new rules and regulations will require our customers or potential customers to comply with new requirements and could require fis to directly comply with new regulations see item i business government regulation for more information regarding certain of these new requirements these new requirements could result in the need for fis to make capital investments to modify our products and services to facilitate our customers and potential customers compliance as well as to deploy additional processes or reporting to comply with new regulations further requirements of the new regulations could result in changes in our customers business practices and those of other marketplace participants that may alter the delivery of services to consumers which could impact the demand for our software and services as well as alter the type or volume of transactions that we process on behalf of our customers as a result the new legislation could have an adverse impact on our financial condition revenues results of operations prospects for future growth and overall business 

many of our customers are subject to a regulatory environment and to industry standards that may change in a manner that reduces the number of transactions in which our customers engage and therefore reduces our revenues 

our customers are subject to a number of government regulations and industry standards with which our services must comply our customers must ensure that our services and related products work within the extensive and evolving regulatory and industry requirements applicable to them federal state foreign or industry authorities could adopt laws rules or regulations affecting our customers businesses that could lead to increased operating costs and could reduce the convenience and functionality of our products and services possibly resulting in reduced market acceptance in addition action by regulatory authorities relating to credit availability data usage privacy or other related regulatory developments could have an adverse effect on our customers and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

regulations enacted by the consumer financial protection bureau may require fis to enact new business practices which may require capital investment which could impact our future operating results 

the consumer financial protection bureau will regulate nonfinancial institutions and providers to those organizations 

the consumer financial protection bureau is establishing its regulatory agenda and will likely pass additional rules for regulating nonfinancial institution providers to ensure adequate protection of consumer privacy and to ensure consumers are not impacted by deceptive business practices the impact of these rules may require fis or its subsidiaries to be subject to additional regulation and adopt additional business practices which could require additional capital expenditures or impact our operating results 

our revenues from the sale of services to members of visa mastercard american express discover and other similar organizations are dependent upon our continued certification and sponsorship and the loss or suspension of certification or sponsorship could adversely affect our business 

in order to provide our card processing services we must be certified including applicable sponsorship by visa mastercard american express discover and other similar organizations these certifications are dependent upon our continued adherence to the standards of the issuing bodies and sponsoring member banks the member financial institutions some of which are our competitors set the standards with which we must comply if we fail to comply with these standards we could be fined our certifications could be suspended or our registration could be terminated the suspension or termination of our certifications or any changes in the rules and regulations governing visa mastercard american express discover or other similar organizations could prevent our registration or otherwise limit our ability to provide services which could result in a reduction in revenue or increased costs of operation which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business 

changes in card association and debit network fees or products could increase costs or otherwise limit our operations 

from time to time card associations and debit networks increase the interchange fees that they charge it is possible that competitive pressures will result in our absorption of a portion of such increases in the future which would increase our operating costs reduce our profit margin and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operation furthermore the rules and regulations of the various card associations and networks prescribe certain capital requirements any increase in the capital level required would further limit our use of capital for other purposes 

interchange fees and related practices have been receiving significant legal and regulatory scrutiny worldwide the resulting regulatory changes that could occur from proposed regulations could alter the fees charged by card associations and debit networks worldwide the impact from the regulations could change from time to time and the resulting changes in fees could impact the card issuance or services offered by our customers which could have an adverse impact to our business or financial condition due to reductions or changes in types of transactions processed on behalf of our customers see item i business government regulation for more information 

if we fail to comply with applicable regulations or to meet regulatory expectations our business results of operations or financial condition could be adversely impacted 

the majority of our data processing services for financial institutions are not directly subject to federal or state regulations specifically applicable to financial institutions such as banks thrifts and credit unions however as a provider of services to these financial institutions our data processing operations are examined on a regular basis by various federal and state regulatory authorities if we fail to comply with any applicable regulations or guidelines for operations of a data services provider we could be subject to regulatory actions or rating changes may not meet contractual obligations or suffer harm to our client relationships or reputation failure to meet the aforementioned requirements or to adapt to new requirements at the federal state or international level could inhibit our ability to retain existing customers or obtain new customers which could have an adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition 

in addition to our data processing services described above we also have business operations that store process or transmit consumer information or have direct relationships with consumers that are obligated to comply with regulations including but not limited to the fair credit reporting act the debt collection practices act and applicable privacy requirements further our international businesses must comply with applicable us laws such as the foreign corrupt practices act failure to maintain compliance with or adapt to changes in any of the aforementioned requirements could result in fines penalties or regulatory actions that could have an adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition 

security breaches or our own failure to comply with laws and regulations and industry security requirements imposed on providers of services to financial institutions and card processing services could harm our business by disrupting our delivery of services and damaging our reputation 

as part of our business we electronically receive process store and transmit sensitive business information of our customers in addition we collect personal consumer data such as names and addresses social security numbers drivers 

license numbers cardholder data and payment history records to support our customers transaction processing as well as part of our check authorization and collection businesses  the uninterrupted operation of our information systems and the confidentiality of the customerconsumer information that resides on such systems are critical to our successful operation if we fail to maintain an adequate security infrastructure adapt to emerging security threats or implement sufficient security standards and technology to protect against security breaches the confidentiality of the information we secure could be compromised unauthorized access to our computer systems or databases could result in the theft or publication of confidential information the deletion or modification of records or could otherwise cause interruptions in our operations these risks are increased when we transmit information over the internet and due to increasing security risks posed by organized crime and politically motivated hackers the company experienced a security breach in 2011 see note 19 to the consolidated financial statements any additional breach could result in significant remediation costs increased cybersecurity protection costs lost revenues litigation and reputational damage 

unauthorized access can also result in financial losses for example we reported a loss of approximately 130 million during the first quarter of 2011 related to unauthorized activities involving one client and twentytwo prepaid card accounts on our sunrise platform at that time we identified approximately 7200 prepaid accounts that may have been at risk and that three individual cardholders nonpublic information may have been disclosed as a result of the unauthorized activities fis worked with the clients to take appropriate action including blocking and reissuing potentially impacted cards for the affected accounts we have continued to monitor these accounts no financial institutions or financial institution customers suffered any financial loss as a result of the attack see “business  government regulation” for specific steps we intend to take however there can be no assurance that these steps will eliminate the possibility that unauthorized access could occur 

further as a provider of services to financial institutions and card processing services we are bound by the same limitations on disclosure of the information we receive from our customers as apply to the customers themselves if we fail to comply with these regulations and industry security requirements we could be exposed to suits for breach of contract governmental proceedings or the imposition of fines or prohibitions on card processing services in addition if more restrictive privacy laws rules or industry security requirements are adopted in the future on the federal or state level or by a specific industry body they could have an adverse impact on us through increased costs or restrictions on business processes any inability to prevent security or privacy breaches or the perception that such breaches may occur could cause our existing customers to lose confidence in our systems and terminate their agreements with us inhibit our ability to attract new customers andor result in increasing regulation or other adverse consequences from the government agencies that regulate our business 

  

misappropriation of our intellectual property and proprietary rights could impair our competitive position 

our ability to compete depends upon proprietary systems and technology despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our services or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary policing unauthorized use of our proprietary rights is difficult we cannot make any assurances that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of technology or that the agreements entered into for that purpose will be enforceable effective trademark service mark copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our applications and services are made available online misappropriation of our intellectual property or potential litigation concerning such matters could have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 

if our applications or services are found to infringe the proprietary rights of others we may be required to change our business practices and may also become subject to significant costs and monetary penalties 

as our information technology applications and services develop we are increasingly subject to infringement claims any claims whether with or without merit could i be expensive and timeconsuming to defend ii result in an injunction or other equitable relief which could cause us to cease making licensing or using applications that incorporate the challenged intellectual property iii require us to redesign our applications if feasible iv divert management’s attention and resources and v require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements in order to obtain the right to use necessary technologies or pay damages resulting from any infringing use 

we face liability to our merchant customers if checks that we have guaranteed are dishonored by the check writer’s bank 

if a check that we have guaranteed is dishonored by the check writer’s bank we must reimburse our merchant customer for the check’s face value and pursue collection of the amount from the check writer in some cases we recognize a liability to our merchant customers for estimated check returns and a receivable for amounts we estimate we will recover from the check writers based on historical experience and other relevant factors the estimated check returns and recovery amounts are subject to the risk that actual amounts returned may exceed our estimates and actual amounts recovered may be less than our estimates 

lack of system integrity fraudulent payments credit quality related to funds settlement or the availability of clearing services could result in a financial loss 

we settle funds on behalf of financial institutions other businesses and consumers and receive funds from clients card issuers payment networks and consumers on a daily basis for a variety of transaction types transactions facilitated by us include debit card credit card electronic bill payment transactions automated clearing house “ach” payments and check clearing that supports consumers financial institutions and other businesses these payment activities rely upon the technology infrastructure that facilitates the verification of activity with counterparties the facilitation of the payment as well as the detection or prevention of fraudulent payments if the continuity of operations integrity of processing or ability to detect or prevent fraudulent payments were compromised this could result in a financial loss to us in addition we rely on various financial institutions to provide ach services in support of funds settlement for certain of our products if we are unable to obtain such ach services in the future that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations in addition we may issue credit to consumers financial institutions or other businesses as part of the funds settlement a default on this credit by a counterparty could result in a financial loss to us furthermore if one of our customers for which we facilitate settlement suffers a fraudulent event due to an error of their controls we may suffer a financial loss if the customer does not have sufficient capital to cover the loss 

our business is subject to the risks of international operations including movements in foreign currency exchange rates 

our international operations represent approximately 20  of total 2011  revenues with approximately 18  of our total revenues conducted in currencies other than the us dollar including the brazilian real british pound and euro as a result our financial condition and operating results could be significantly affected by risks associated with international activities including economic and labor conditions political instability tax laws including us taxes on foreign subsidiaries differences in business practices and changes in the value of the us dollar versus local currencies in addition we are less wellknown internationally than in the united states have less experience with local business conditions and may face challenges in successfully managing small operations located far from our headquarters because of the greater difficulty in overseeing and guiding operations from a distance 

as we expand our international operations more of our customers may pay us in foreign currencies conducting business in currencies other than us dollars subjects us to fluctuations in currency exchange rates our primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to foreign currencies in brazil europe australia and parts of asia the us dollar value of our net investments in foreign operations the periodic conversion of foreigndenominated earnings to the us dollar our reporting currency our results of operations and in some cases cash flows could be adversely affected in a material manner by movements in foreign currency exchange rates these risks could cause an adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations 

failure to attract and retain skilled technical employees or senior management personnel could harm our ability to grow 

our future success depends upon our ability to attract and retain highlyskilled technical personnel because the development of our products and services requires knowledge of computer hardware operating system software system management software and application software our technical personnel must be proficient in a number of disciplines competition for such technical personnel is intense and our failure to hire and retain talented personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

our future growth will also require sales and marketing financial and administrative personnel to develop and support new products and services to enhance and support current products and services and to expand operational and financial systems there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain the necessary personnel to accomplish our growth strategies and we may experience constraints that could adversely affect our ability to satisfy client demand in a timely fashion 

our ability to maintain compliance with applicable laws rules and regulations and to manage and monitor the risks facing our business relies upon the ability to maintain skilled compliance security risk and audit professionals competition for such skillsets is intense and our failure to hire and retain talented personnel could have an adverse effect on our internal control environment and impact our operating results 

our senior management team has significant experience in the financial services industry either at fis or with clients or competitors and the loss of this leadership could have an adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition further the loss of this leadership may have an adverse impact on senior managements ability to provide effective oversight and strategic direction for all key functions within the company which could impact future business operating results and financial condition 

       we are the subject of various legal proceedings that could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability   

       we are involved in various litigation matters including in some cases classaction and patent infringement litigation and also are involved in or the subject of governmental or regulatory agency inquiries or investigations from time to time if we are unsuccessful in our defense in the litigation matters or compliance with any governmental or regulatory rules we may be forced to pay damages or fines andor change our business practices any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

 unfavorable resolution of tax contingencies could adversely affect our tax expense 

our tax returns and positions are subject to review and audit by federal state local and international taxing authorities an unfavorable outcome to a tax audit could result in higher tax expense and could negatively impact our effective tax rate financial position results of operations and cash flows in the current andor future periods 

    the chairman of our board of directors and other officers and directors have interests and positions that could present potential conflicts 

we and certain of our subsidiaries are parties to a variety of related party agreements and relationships with fnf william p foley ii who is our chairman is currently the chairman of the board of directors of fnf brent b bickett and michael l gravelle who are executive officers of fis are also executive officers of fnf william p foley ii brent b bickett and michael l gravelle also own or hold substantial amounts of fnf stock and stock options thomas m hagerty and richard n massey who are both directors of fis are also directors of fnf as a result of the foregoing there may be circumstances where certain of our executive officers and directors may be subject to conflicts of interest with respect to among other things i our ongoing relationship with fnf including related party agreements and other arrangements with respect to the administration of tax matters employee benefits and indemnification ii the quality pricing and other terms associated with services that we provide to fnf or that fnf provides to us under related party agreements iii business opportunities arising for either us or fnf that could be pursued by either us or by fnf and iv conflicts of time with respect to matters potentially or actually involving or affecting fis 

we seek to manage these potential conflicts through abstention oversight by independent members of our board of directors and provisions in our agreements with fnf however there can be no assurance that such measures will be effective or that we will be able to resolve all potential conflicts with fnf or that the resolution of any such conflicts will be no less favorable to us than if we were dealing with an unaffiliated third party 

  our agreements with related parties may be more or less favorable than agreements negotiated at armslength with independent parties 

we have entered into various agreements with certain related parties including without limitation fnf and ceridian corporation pursuant to which we will provide services to each such related party as a client we believe the amount earned from or charged by us under each such arrangement is fair and reasonable and that our service arrangements are priced within the range of prices we offer to third parties however the amounts we earned or that were charged under these arrangements were not negotiated at armslength and may not represent the terms that we might have obtained from an unrelated third party for similar services any inferior terms that such agreements may contain as compared to agreements negotiated with unrelated third parties may have an adverse impact on our results of operations 

risks related to business combinations 

 if we are unable to successfully consummate and integrate acquisitions our results of operations may be adversely affected 

we have made numerous acquisitions in recent years as a part of our growth strategy we anticipate that we will continue to seek to acquire complementary businesses and services this strategy will depend on the ability to find suitable acquisitions and finance them on acceptable terms we may require additional debt or equity financing for future acquisitions and doing so may be made more difficult by our existing debt if we are unable to acquire suitable acquisition candidates we may experience slower growth further after successfully completing acquisitions we face challenges in integrating acquired businesses these challenges include eliminating redundant operations facilities and systems coordinating management and personnel retaining key employees managing different corporate cultures and achieving cost reductions and crossselling opportunities there can 

be no assurance that we will be able to fully integrate all aspects of acquired businesses successfully or fully realize the potential benefits of bringing them together and the process of integrating these acquisitions may disrupt our business and divert our resources 

we have a substantial investment in our brazilian venture and drive significant revenue through that venture that would be lost and result in significant termination costs if our venture partner were to terminate the agreement 

revenue attributable to our brazilian venture partner banco bradesco accounted for 3002 million  in 2011 the brazilian venture processes over 50 million cards and is continuing to grow the contract that we have with our brazilian venture partner allows for the termination of the contract at any point during the ten year term this risk of contract termination is mitigated by guaranteed performance targets and minimum payments that would be triggered upon the event of a termination these payments have been established based on fis expected rate of return for the contract over a 10year period the required payments and buyouts decline each year and are further reduced by returns in excess of the expected returns for the contract and reduce the overall barrier to exiting the venture if our partner were to exit the agreement this could have a significant impact on our future revenue and growth for further detail on our brazilian venture see note 6 

additionally we employ approximately 10000 employees in brazil who would have the ability to file labor claims if their employment is terminated if our brazilian venture partner were to terminate the agreement we may be subject to labor claims filed by employees of the venture these claims if realized could result in a significant cost and impact to our earnings 

we have substantial investments in recorded goodwill and other intangible assets as a result of prior acquisitions and a severe or extended economic downturn could cause these investments to become impaired requiring writedowns that would reduce our operating income 

as of december 31 2011  goodwill aggregated to 85428 million  or 617  of total assets and other indefinite lived intangible assets aggregated to 810 million  or 06  of total assets current accounting rules require goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets to be assessed for impairment at least annually or whenever changes in circumstances indicate potential impairment factors that may be considered a change in circumstance include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results a significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization and negative industry or economic trends the results of our fiscal year 2011  annual assessment of the recoverability of goodwill indicated that the fair values of the company’s reporting units were in excess of the carrying values of those reporting units and thus no goodwill impairment existed as of december 31 2011  with the exception of the capco trademark in north america see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements the fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets was in excess of the carrying value of those assets however if worldwide or united states economic conditions decline significantly with negative impacts to bank spending and consumer behavior  or if other business or market changes impact our outlook  the carrying amount of our goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets may no longer be recoverable and we may be required to record an impairment charge which would have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

as of december 31 2011  intangible assets with definite useful lives aggregated to 18223 million  or 132  of total assets current accounting rules require intangible assets with definite useful lives to be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable factors that may be considered a change in circumstance include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results a significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization and negative industry or economic trends 

we will continue to monitor the fair value of our other intangible assets as well as our market capitalization and the impact of any economic downturn on our business to determine if there is an impairment in future periods 

risks related to our indebtedness 

losses consolidations and failures in the financial services industry may impact our ability to borrow funds or the ability of our lenders to fulfill their obligations under our interest rate swap agreements 

many financial institutions are currently experiencing negative operating results in some cases these negative operating results have led to financial institution failures andor consolidations as a result lenders may become insolvent or further tighten lending standards which could in turn make it more difficult or impossible for lenders to perform their obligations under our interest rate swap agreements or for us to borrow under our credit agreement obtain financing on favorable terms or obtain financing or interest rate swap agreements at all our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely 

affected if a financial institution fails to fulfill its obligations under our interest rate swap agreements or we are unable to draw funds under our credit agreement or obtain other costeffective financing 

our existing levels of debt and debt service requirements may adversely affect our financial condition or operational flexibility and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our outstanding indebtedness 

as of december 31 2011  we had total debt of approximately 48098 million  this level of debt could have adverse consequences for our business financial condition operating results and operational flexibility including the following i the debt level may cause us to have difficulty borrowing money in the future for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions or other purposes ii our debt level may limit operational flexibility and our ability to pursue business opportunities and implement certain business strategies iii we use a large portion of our operating cash flow to pay principal and interest on our senior secured credit facilities and interest on our notes which reduces the amount of money available to finance operations acquisitions and other business activities repay other indebtedness purchase our outstanding stock and pay shareholder dividends iv some of our debt has a variable rate of interest which exposes us to the risk of increased interest rates v we have a higher level of debt than some of our competitors or potential competitors which may cause a competitive disadvantage and may reduce flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions including increased competition and vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  vi there are significant maturities on our debt that we may not be able to fulfill or that may be refinanced at higher rates and vii  if we fail to satisfy our obligations under our outstanding debt or fail to comply with the financial or other restrictive covenants contained in the indenture governing our notes or our senior secured credit facility an event of default could result that would cause all of our debt to become due and payable and could permit the lenders under our senior secured credit facility to foreclose on the assets securing such debt 

the covenants relating to our notes and the fis credit agreement are limited and do not prohibit us from incurring additional debt or taking other actions that could exacerbate the risks described in the preceding risk factor or otherwise negatively impact holders of our notes 

we may be able to incur substantially more debt in the future although the indenture governing our notes and the agreements governing the fis credit agreement and other indebtedness each contain restrictions on our incurrence of additional indebtedness these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions and under certain circumstances indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial as of december 31 2011  we had approximately 8240 million  of borrowing capacity available under our existing fis credit agreement to the extent new debt is added to our current levels the risks described above could substantially increase

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend 

the following section discusses management’s view of the financial condition and results of operations of fis and its consolidated subsidiaries as of december 31 2011  and 2010  and for the years ended december 31 2011  2010  and 2009  

this section should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes of fis included elsewhere in this annual report this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forwardlooking statements see “forwardlooking statements” and “risk factors” for a discussion of the uncertainties risks and assumptions associated with these forwardlooking statements that could cause future results to differ materially from those reflected in this section 

overview 

fis is a leading global provider dedicated to banking and payments technologies with a long history deeply rooted in the financial services sector fis serves more than 14000 institutions in over 100 countries headquartered in jacksonville florida fis employs approximately 33000 people worldwide and holds leadership positions in payment processing and banking solutions providing software services and outsourcing of the technology that drives financial institutions fis tops the 2011 annual fintech 100 list is a member of the fortune 500 us and of standard and poor’s sp 500 ®  index we have four reporting segments fsg psg isg and corporate and other a description of these segments is included above in item 1 revenues by segment and the results of operations of our segments are discussed below in segment results of operations 

business trends and conditions 

       our revenue is derived from a combination of recurring services professional services and software license fees recurring services which have historically represented more than 80 of our revenue are provided under multiyear contracts that contribute relative stability to our revenue stream however a significant portion of these recurring revenues are derived from transaction processing fees and fluctuate with the level of deposit and card transactions associated with consumer and commercial activity sales of software licenses and professional services are less predictable and can be regarded as discretionary spending by our customers we continually seek opportunities to enhance revenues and to manage our costs and capital expenditures prudently in light of any shifting revenue trends in response to broader economic conditions 

  

we acquired capco in december 2010 to broaden our capabilities to provide strategic and business transformation consulting while this will generate increased revenues the lower profit margin realized for professional services as compared to our other solutions has resulted in profit margin compression the addition of capco has also reduced the relative proportion of our recurring revenue stream   

as the payment market continues to evolve from paperbased to electronic we continue to add new services responsive to this trend card transactions continue to increase as a percentage of total pointofsale payments which fuels continuing demand for cardrelated services in recent years we have added a variety of storedvalue card types internet banking and electronic bill presentmentpayment services as well as a number of card enhancement and loyaltyreward programs the common goal of these offerings continues to be convenience and security for the consumer coupled with value to the financial institution the evolution to electronic transactions also intensifies the vulnerability to fraud increasing the demand for our risk management solutions at the same time the use of checks continues to decline as a percentage of total payments which negatively impacts our check warranty and itemprocessing businesses 

we compete for both licensing and outsourcing business and thus are affected by the decisions of financial institutions to utilize our services under an outsourced arrangement or to process inhouse under a software license and maintenance agreement as a provider of outsourcing solutions we benefit from multiyear recurring revenue streams which help moderate the effects of yeartoyear economic changes on our results of operations one of the current trends from which we are benefiting in the financial services industry is the migration by our clients to an outsourced model to improve their profitability 

while we are cautious regarding broader economic improvement we expect banks to continue investing in new technology and believe we are well positioned to capitalize as the overall market continues to recover we anticipate consolidation within the banking industry to continue including additional bank failures and increased merger and acquisition activity as a whole consolidation activity is detrimental to our business consolidation at the transaction level may be beneficial or detrimental to our business when consolidations occur merger partners often operate disparate systems licensed from competing service providers the newly formed entity generally makes a determination to migrate its core and payments 

systems to a single platform when a financial institution processing client is involved in a consolidation we may benefit by expanding the use of our services if such services are chosen to survive the consolidation and support the newly combined entity conversely we may lose market share if we are providing services to both entities or we are not the merging parties provider of core or payment processing or if a customer of ours is involved in a consolidation and our services are not chosen to survive the consolidation and support the newly combined entity it is also possible that larger financial institutions resulting from consolidation would have greater leverage in negotiating terms or could decide to perform inhouse some or all of the services which we currently provide or could provide we seek to mitigate the risks of consolidations by offering other competitive services to take advantage of specific opportunities at the surviving company 

the doddfrank act and associated durbin amendment were passed and signed into law in 2010 the doddfrank act represents a comprehensive overhaul of the financial services industry within the united states establishes the new federal bureau of consumer financial protection and will require this and other federal agencies to implement many new regulations the durbin amendment released by the federal reserve in june 2011 mandates a cap on debit transaction interchange fees for card issuers with assets greater than 100 billion this legislated interchange fee cap has the potential to alter the type andor volume of cardbased transactions that we process on behalf of our customers we believe we are competitively positioned to offset or take advantage of any potential shifts in payment transaction volume as we offer multiple payment solutions and options to our clients we also believe that compliance with the network exclusivity provisions of the durbin amendment which require all debit card issuers to have at least two unaffiliated networks for purposes of processing signature debit and pin debit transactions could positively or negatively impact transaction volumes in our nyce pin debit network these new regulations could result in the need for us to make capital investments to modify our products and services to facilitate our existing customers and potential customers compliance further the requirements of the new regulations and the timing of their effective dates could result in changes in our customers business practices that may alter their delivery of services to consumers and the timing of their investment decisions which could change the demand for our software and services as well as alter the type or volume of transactions that we process on behalf of our customers 

notwithstanding challenging global economic conditions our international business continued to experience growth across all major regions during the year ended december 31 2011 including europe the majority of our european revenue is generated by clients in germany france and the united kingdom those countries encountering the most significant economic challenges including spain italy greece ireland and portugal account for less than 1 of our international revenue base 

  

critical accounting policies 

the accounting policies described below are those we consider critical in preparing our consolidated financial statements these policies require management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures with respect to contingent liabilities and assets at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods actual amounts could differ from those estimates see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed description of the significant accounting policies that have been followed in preparing our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

the company generates revenues from the delivery of bank processing credit and debit card processing services other payment processing services professional services software licensing and software related services and products revenues are recognized when evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred fees are fixed or determinable and collection is considered probable we are frequently a party to multiple concurrent contracts with the same customer these situations require judgment to determine whether the individual contracts should be aggregated or evaluated separately for purposes of revenue recognition in making this determination we consider the timing of negotiating and executing the contracts whether the different elements of the contracts are interdependent and whether any of the payment terms of the contracts are interrelated due to the large number broad nature and average size of individual contracts we are party to the impact of judgments and assumptions that we apply in recognizing revenue for any single contract is not likely to have a material effect on our consolidated operations or financial position however the broader accounting policy assumptions that we apply across similar arrangements or classes of customers could significantly influence the timing and amount of revenue recognized in our historical and future results of operations or financial position additional information about our revenue recognition policies is included in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

the company analyzes trade accounts receivable by considering historical bad debts customer creditworthiness current economic trends changes in customer payment terms and collection trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for 

doubtful accounts any change in the assumptions used may result in an additional allowance for doubtful accounts being recognized in the period in which the change occurs the allowance for doubtful accounts was 331 million  as of december 31 2011  and 2010  respectively 

reserves for check guarantee losses 

in our check guarantee business if a guaranteed check presented to a merchant customer is dishonored by the check writer’s bank we reimburse our merchant customer for the check’s face value and pursue collection of the amount from the delinquent check writer loss reserves and anticipated recoveries are primarily determined by performing a historical analysis of our check loss and recovery experience and considering other factors that could affect that experience in the future such factors include the general economy the overall industry mix of our customer volumes statistical analysis of check fraud trends within our customer volumes and the quality of returned checks once these factors are considered we establish a rate for check losses that is calculated by dividing the expected check losses by dollar volume processed and a rate for anticipated recoveries that is calculated by dividing the anticipated recoveries by the total amount of related check losses these rates are then applied against the dollar volume processed and check losses respectively each month and charged to costs of revenues the estimated check returns and recovery amounts are subject to risk that actual amounts returned and recovered may be different than our estimates 

historically such estimation processes have proved to be materially accurate however our projections of probable check guarantee losses and anticipated recoveries are inherently uncertain and as a result we cannot predict with certainty the amount of such items changes in economic conditions the risk characteristics and composition of our customers and other factors could impact our actual and projected amounts we recorded check guarantee losses net of anticipated recoveries excluding service fees of 680 million  and 694 million  respectively for the years ended december 31 2011  and 2010  a ten percent difference in our estimated check guarantee loss reserve net of estimated recoveries as of december 31 2011  would have impacted 2011 net earnings by less than 20 million aftertax 

computer software 

computer software includes the fair value of software acquired in business combinations purchased software and capitalized software development costs as of december 31 2011  and 2010  computer software net of accumulated amortization was 8815 million  and 9090 million  respectively purchased software is recorded at cost and amortized using the straight line method over its estimated useful life and software acquired in business combinations is recorded at its fair value and amortized using straight line and accelerated methods over its estimated useful life 

the capitalization of software development costs is governed by fasb asc subtopic 98520 if the software is to be sold leased or otherwise marketed or by fasb asc subtopic 35040 if the software is for internal use after the technological feasibility of the software has been established for software to be marketed or at the beginning of application development for internaluse software software development costs which include salaries and related payroll costs and costs of independent contractors incurred during development are capitalized research and development costs incurred prior to the establishment of technological feasibility for software to be marketed or prior to application development for internaluse software are expensed as incurred software development costs are amortized on a product by product basis commencing on the date of general release of the products for software to be marketed or the date placed in service for internaluse software software development costs for software to be marketed are amortized using the greater of 1 the straightline method over its estimated useful life which ranges from three  to ten  years or 2 the ratio of current revenues to total anticipated revenue over its useful life 

in determining useful lives management considers historical results and technological trends which may influence the estimate useful lives for all computer software range from three to 10 years amortization expense for computer software was 2094 million  1951 million and 1498 million in 2011  2010  and 2009  respectively included in discontinued operations in the consolidated statement of earnings was amortization expense on computer software of 00 million  33 million  and 07 million  for 2011  2010  and 2009  respectively we also assess the recorded value of computer software for impairment on a regular basis by comparing the carrying value to the estimated future cash flows to be generated by the underlying software asset there are inherent uncertainties in determining the expected useful life or cash flows to be generated from computer software while we have not historically experienced significant changes in these estimates we could be subject to such changes in the future 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

we are required to allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the 

transaction at their estimated fair values the estimates used to determine the fair value of longlived assets such as intangible assets are complex and require a significant amount of management judgment we generally engage independent valuation specialists to assist us in making fair value determinations we are also required to estimate the useful lives of intangible assets to determine the amount of acquisitionrelated intangible asset amortization expense to record in future periods we periodically review the estimated useful lives assigned to our definitelived intangible assets to determine whether such estimated useful lives continue to be appropriate additionally we review our indefinitelived intangible assets to determine if there is any change in circumstances that may indicate the asset’s useful life is no longer indefinite 

we review the carrying value of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable prior to 2011 the authoritative guidance required us to perform a twostep impairment test on goodwill first we compared the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value we determine the fair value of our reporting units based on a weighted average of multiple valuation techniques principally a combination of an income approach and a market approach the income approach calculates a value based upon the present value of estimated future cash flows while the market approach utilizes earnings multiples of similarly situated guideline public companies if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the reporting unit’s net assets goodwill is not impaired and further testing is not required if the carrying value of the reporting unit’s net assets exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit then we would perform the second step of the impairment test to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill and any impairment charge 

in the fourth quarter of 2011 the company early adopted the provisions of fasb accounting standards update no 201108 asu 201108 testing goodwill for impairment  the revised standard allows an entity first to assess qualitatively whether it is necessary to perform the stepone quantitative test step zero an entity is required to perform step one only if the entity concludes that it is more likely than not that a reporting units fair value is less than its carrying amount that is a likelihood of more than 50 percent asu 201108 provided examples of events and circumstances that should be considered in performing the step zero qualitative assessment including macroeconomic conditions industry and market considerations cost factors overall financial performance events affecting a reporting unit or the entity as a whole and a sustained decrease in share price   there was a substantial excess of fair value over carrying value for each of our reporting units in the 2010 step one analysis in performing the 2011 step zero qualitative analysis examining those factors most likely to affect our valuations we concluded that it is more likely than not that the fair value of each of our reporting units continues to exceed their carrying amounts consequently we did not perform a step one analysis in 2011 

we also estimate the fair value of acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives and compare this amount to the underlying carrying value annually during the year ended december 31 2011 we recorded an impairment charge of 91 million related to the capco trademark in north america during the year ended december 31 2010  the portion of the unamortized contract intangible asset recorded at the initiation of the brazilian venture that was attributable to banco santander was deemed impaired due to the exit of banco santander accordingly we recorded a pretax impairment charge of 1403 million  in the third quarter of 2010  additionally in 2010  we recorded a 52 million  impairment of intangible assets related to the discontinued operations of participacoes as discussed in notes 6 and 9 to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2009  our analysis of indefinitelived intangible assets indicated an impairment of certain trademarks which were discontinued as a result of the company’s rebranding campaign initiated on october 1 2009 following the acquisition of metavante accordingly we recorded a pretax impairment charge of 1240 million  in the fourth quarter of 2009  

determining the fair value of a reporting unit or acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives involves judgment and the use of significant estimates and assumptions which include assumptions regarding the revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate estimated future cash flows riskadjusted discount rates and future economic and market conditions and other assumptions 

accounting for income taxes 

as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements we are required to determine income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate this process involves estimating actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing recognition of items for income tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred income tax assets and liabilities which are included within the consolidated balance sheets we must then assess the likelihood that deferred income tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely establish a valuation allowance to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period we must reflect this increase as an expense within income tax expense in the consolidated statements of earnings determination of the income tax expense requires estimates and can involve complex issues that may require an extended period to resolve further changes in the geographic mix of revenues or in the estimated level of annual 

pretax income can cause the overall effective income tax rate to vary from period to period we believe that our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that we adequately provide for any known tax contingencies we believe the estimates and assumptions used to support our evaluation of tax benefit realization are reasonable however final determination of prioryear tax liabilities either by settlement with tax authorities or expiration of statutes of limitations could be materially different than estimates reflected in assets and liabilities and historical income tax provisions the outcome of these final determinations could have a material effect on our income tax provision net income or cash flows in the period that determination is made

processing and services revenues 

processing and services revenues totaled 57457 million  52695 million  and 37111 million  in 2011  2010  and 2009  respectively the increase in revenue during 2011  of 4762 million  or 90  as compared to 2010  is primarily attributable to incremental revenues of 3047 million  from 2010  acquisitions increased demand for professional services and increased processing revenues total revenue growth in these areas was tempered by lower item processing and retail check activity and the change in reporting certain merchant interchange fees from gross to net revenue recognition as discussed in greater detail under  segment results of operations  the 2011  period also included 474 million of favorable foreign currency impact resulting from a weaker us dollar during the 2011  period the 2010  period was also favorably impacted by the recognition of an 833 million  termination fee in connection with banco santander’s exit from the brazilian venture the increase in revenue during 2010  of 15584 million  or 420  as compared to 2009  is primarily attributable to incremental revenues from the metavante acquisition and to a lesser extent the recognition of the 833 million  termination fee mentioned above revenue 

from 2010  acquisitions of 234 million and a favorable foreign currency impact of 264 million resulting from a weaker us dollar 

cost of revenues and gross profit 

cost of revenues totaled 39980 million  36377 million  and 27415 million  in 2011  2010  and 2009  respectively resulting in gross profit of 17477 million  16318 million  and 9696 million  in 2011  2010  and 2009  respectively gross profit as a percentage of revenues “gross margin” was 304  310  and 261  in 2011  2010  and 2009  respectively the increase in cost of revenues of 3603 million  in the 2011  period as compared to the 2010  period is directly attributable to the revenue variances addressed above the termination fee received in connection with banco santanders exit from the brazilian venture favorably augmented gross margins for the 2010  periods contributing to a decrease in gross margin of 60  basis points during the 2011  period by comparison further while capco has provided revenue growth in 2011 the lower margin contribution has unfavorably impacted gross margin   the increase in cost of revenues of 8962 million  in the 2010  period as compared to the 2009  period is directly attributable to the revenue variances addressed above the increase in gross margin of 490 basis points for 2010  over 2009  was driven by the cost synergy initiatives associated with the metavante acquisition as well as by the termination fee received in connection with banco santanders exit from the brazilian venture 

selling general and administrative expenses

the fis credit agreement contains provisions permitting us to obtain additional term andor revolving loans in the future conditioned upon our ability to obtain additional commitments from lenders to fund those loans in a principal amount of up to 7500 million  the fis credit agreement remains subject to customary affirmative negative and financial covenants including among other things limits on the creation of liens limits on incurring indebtedness restrictions on investments and dispositions limitations on dividends and other restricted payments a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum leverage ratio upon an event of default under the fis credit agreement the administrative agent can accelerate the maturity of all amounts borrowed events of default include the failure to pay principal and interest in a timely manner and breach of certain covenants

we monitor the financial stability of our counterparties on an ongoing basis the lender commitments under the undrawn portions of the revolving loan are comprised of a diversified set of financial institutions both domestic and international the combined commitments of our top 10  revolving lenders comprise about 72  of our revolving loan the failure of any single lender to perform their obligations under the revolving loan would not adversely impact our ability to fund operations if the single largest lender were to default under the terms of the fis credit agreement impacting the capacity of the revolving loan the maximum loss of available capacity on the undrawn portion of the revolving loan as of december 31 2011  would be approximately 1057 million  

as of december 31 2011  we have entered into interest rate swap transactions converting a portion of the interest rate exposure on our term loans from variable to fixed see item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risks

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risks 

tableend 

  market risk 

we are exposed to market risks primarily from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates we use certain derivative financial instruments including interest rate swaps and foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage interest rate and foreign currency risk we do not use derivatives for trading purposes to generate income or to engage in speculative activity 

  interest rate risk 

in addition to existing cash balances and cash provided by operating activities we use fixed rate and variable rate debt to finance our operations we are exposed to interest rate risk on these debt obligations and related interest rate swaps 

the notes represent substantially all of our fixedrate longterm debt obligations the carrying value of the notes was 12500 million  as of december 31 2011  the fair value of the notes was approximately 13625 million  as of december 31 2011  the potential reduction in fair value of the notes from a hypothetical 10  percent increase in market interest rates would not be material to the overall fair value of the debt we currently have no plans to repurchase the notes before their maturity and therefore fluctuations in market interest rates would not have an effect on our results of operations or financial condition 

our floating rate longterm debt obligations principally relate to borrowings under the fis credit agreement as of december 31 2011  we are paying interest on our term loan a2 of libor plus 225  and on our term loan b at libor plus 325  with libor subject to a 100  floor interest on the revolving loan is generally payable at libor plus an applicable margin of up to 250  and is subject to an unused commitment fee of up to 050  each based upon the companys leverage ratio an increase of 100 basis points in the libor rate would increase our annual debt service under the fis credit agreement after we include the impact of our interest rate swaps by 129 million  based on principal amounts outstanding as of december 31 2011  we performed the foregoing sensitivity analysis based on the principal amount of our floating rate debt as of december 31 2011  less the principal amount of such debt that was then subject to an interest rate swap converting such debt into fixed rate debt this sensitivity analysis is based solely on the principal amount of such debt as of december 31 2011  and does not take into account any changes that occurred in the prior 12 months or that may take place in the next 12 months in the amount of our outstanding debt or in the notional amount of outstanding interest rate swaps in respect of our debt further in this sensitivity analysis the change in interest rates is assumed to be applicable for an entire year for comparison purposes based on principal amounts on the revolving loan and term loans a1 and a2 and old term loan b outstanding as of december 31 2010  and calculated in the same manner as set forth above an increase of 100 basis points in the libor rate would have increased our annual interest expense after we calculate the impact of our interest rate swaps by 34 million  

we use interest rate swaps for the purpose of managing our interest expense through the mix of fixed rate and floating rate debt during the year ended december 31 2011  the notional amount of our outstanding interest rate swaps decreased by 11000 million  as of december 31 2011  we have entered into the following interest rate swap transactions converting a portion of the interest rate exposure on our term and revolving loan from variable to fixed in millions 



 

 we have designated these interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes a portion of the amount included in accumulated other comprehensive earnings is reclassified into interest expense as a yield adjustment as interest payments are made on the term and revolving loans in accordance with the authoritative guidance for fair value measurements the inputs used to determine the estimated fair value of our interest rate swaps are level 2type measurements we considered our own credit risk and the credit risk of the counterparties when determining the fair value of our interest rate swaps 

foreign currency risk 

we are exposed to foreign currency risks that arise from normal business operations these risks include the translation of local currency balances of foreign subsidiaries transaction gains and losses associated with intercompany loans with foreign 

subsidiaries and transactions denominated in currencies other than a locations functional currency our objective is to minimize our exposure to these risks through a combination of normal operating activities and the use of foreign currency forward exchange contracts contracts are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries 

our exposure to foreign currency exchange risks generally arises from our nonus operations to the extent they are conducted in local currency changes in foreign currency exchange rates affect translations of revenues denominated in currencies other than the us dollar our international operations generated approximately 11776 million  in revenues during the year ended december 31 2011  of which approximately 10058 million  was denominated in currencies other than the us dollar the major currencies to which we are exposed are the brazilian real the euro and the british pound sterling a 10 move in average exchange rates for these currencies assuming a simultaneous and immediate 10 change in all of such rates for the relevant period would have resulted in the following increase or decrease in our reported revenues for the years ended december 31 2011  2010  and 2009  in millions 



the impact on earnings of the foregoing assumed 10 change in each of the periods presented would not have been significant 

 revenue included 474 million and operating income included 82 million of favorable foreign currency impact during the year ended december 31 2011  resulting from a weaker us dollar during the 2011  period compared to 2010  

our foreign exchange risk management policy permits the use of derivative instruments such as forward contracts and options to reduce volatility in our results of operations andor cash flows resulting from foreign exchange rate fluctuations our international operations revenues and expenses are generally denominated in local currency which limits the economic exposure to foreign exchange risk in those jurisdictions we do not enter into foreign currency derivative instruments for trading purposes we entered into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency exposure to intercompany loans as of december 31 2011  the notional amount of these derivatives was approximately 594 million  and the fair value was nominal these derivatives are intended to hedge the foreign exchange risks related to intercompany loans but have not been designated as hedges for accounting purposes

our global marketing strategy is to develop and lead the execution of the various business units’ strategic plans in support 

of their revenue and profitability goals key components include thought leadership consistent message development internal and external communications client conference content management web content creation and management trade shows demand generation campaign involvement and collateral development and management 

  

beginning october 1 2009 we entered into a comprehensive rebranding campaign to bring all of our software and services under one comprehensive set of trademarks including fis and nyce in support of our marketing strategy 

  

patents trademarks and other intellectual property 

  

the company owns intellectual property including trademarks trade names and patents that are important to its future success we rely on a combination of contractual restrictions internal security practices patents and applicable law to establish and protect our software technology and expertise worldwide we rely on trademark law to protect our rights in those brands while we intend to continue taking appropriate measures to protect our intellectual property rights these legal protections and arrangements afford only limited protection and there is no assurance that our competitors will not independently develop or license products services or capabilities that are substantially equivalent or superior to ours in general we own the proprietary rights necessary for the conduct of our business although we do license certain items from third parties under armslength agreements for varying terms 

  

competition 

  

our primary competitors include internal technology departments within financial institutions and retailers data processing or software development departments of large companies or large computer manufacturers thirdparty payment processors independent computer services firms companies that develop and deploy software applications companies that provide customized development implementation and support services and companies that market software for the financial services industry some of these competitors possess substantially greater financial sales and marketing resources than we do competitive factors impacting the success of our services include the quality of the technologybased application or service application features and functions ease of delivery and integration ability of the provider to maintain enhance and support the applications or services and price we believe that we compete favorably in each of these categories in addition we believe that our financial institution industry expertise combined with our ability to offer multiple applications services and integrated solutions to individual customers enhances our competitiveness against companies with more limited offerings specific competitors for both financial and payment solutions include fiserv inc and jack henry and associates inc in the core processing market we also compete with open solutions inc international business machines corporation ibm accenture ltd alliance data systems corporation dst systems harland financial solutions inc sei investments company s1corporation sungard data systems inc and in certain nonus markets alnova technologies corporation oracle financial services software limited formerly known as iflex solutions limited misys plc infosys technologies limited and temenos group ag our competitors in the card services market include mastercard incorporated visa inc and thirdparty credit and debit card processors such as first data corporation total system services inc hp enterprise services and payment systems for credit unions pscu competitors in the check risk management services market include first data corporation’s telecheck services division heartland payments systems inc total systems services inc and global payments inc 

  

research and development 

  

our research and development activities have related primarily to the design and development of processing systems and related software applications and risk management platforms we expect to continue our practice of investing an appropriate level of resources to maintain enhance and extend the functionality of our proprietary systems and existing software applications to develop new and innovative software applications and systems in response to the needs of our customers and to enhance the capabilities surrounding our outsourcing infrastructure in addition we intend to offer services that are compatible with new and emerging delivery channels 

  

as part of our research and development process we evaluate current and emerging technology for compatibility with our existing and future software platforms to this end we engage with various hardware and software vendors in evaluation of various infrastructure components where appropriate we use thirdparty technology components in the development of our software applications and service offerings thirdparty software may be used for highly specialized business functions which we may not be able to develop internally within time and budget constraints additionally thirdparty software may be used for commodity type functions within a technology platform environment in the case of nearly all of our thirdparty software enterprise license agreements exist for the thirdparty component and either alternative suppliers exist or transfer rights exist to ensure the continuity of supply as a result we are not materially dependent upon any thirdparty technology components we work with our customers to determine the appropriate timing and approach to introducing technology or infrastructure changes 

to our applications and services in the years ended december 31 2010  2009 and 2008  approximately 2 to 3 of revenues were invested in research and development efforts excluding amounts capitalized 

  

government regulation 

  

our services are subject to a broad range of complex federal state and foreign regulation including federal truthinlending and truthinsavings rules regulation aa unfair or deceptive acts or practices privacy laws usury laws the equal credit opportunity act the electronic funds transfer act the fair credit reporting act the fair debt collection practices act the bank secrecy act the usa patriot act the internal revenue code the employee retirement income security act the health insurance portability and accountability act the community reinvestment act and the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the doddfrank act the compliance of our services with these and other applicable laws and regulations depends on a variety of factors including the manner in which our clients use them our clients are contractually responsible for determining what is required of them under applicable laws and regulations so that we can assist them in their compliance efforts the failure of our services to comply with applicable laws and regulations could result in restrictions on our ability to provide them as well as the imposition of civil fines andor criminal penalties the four principal areas of regulation impacting our business are 

  

 the doddfrank act was enacted and signed into law on july 21 2010 among other provisions this legislation created the consumer financial protection bureau the bureau whose sole focus is to develop implement and with respect to financial institutions with more than 10 billion in assets enforce consumer protection rules promulgated by the bureau for financial institutions with less than 10 billion in assets enforcement of the rules will be carried out by such institutions primary federal regulator since the regulations implementing the act have not yet been finalized we are uncertain as to what degree the legislation may affect our business in the future 

the housing assistance tax act of 2008 requires among other provisions information reporting obligations on payment settlement entities for calendar years beginning after december 31 2010 this law requires every merchant acquiring entity and third party settlement organization to file information returns for the gross amount of reportable payment transactions for the calendar year and the reportable payment transactions for each month of the calendar year the reportable payment transactions are any transactions in which a payment card is accepted as payment and any third party payment network this law will result in significant additional form 1099 reporting requirements in january 2011 for fis 

  

 9 

require entities engaged in money transmission and the sale of stored value cards to register as a money transmitter with that jurisdiction’s banking department 

  

also included in the doddfrank act is a requirement that the federal reserve board enact regulations governing interchange fees and network fees arising from electronic debit card and reloadable generaluse gift card transactions under the legislation the amount of interchange fees that issuers with more than 10 billion in assets may charge must be “reasonable and proportional” to the cost incurred by the issuer network fees are regulated to the extent that they are used to circumvent restrictions on interchange fees or compensate issuers with respect to electronic debit card transactions the legislation also requires that the regulations to be enacted by the federal reserve board prohibit issuers from restricting the processing of transactions to networks they own or are affiliated with and from “inhibiting” retailers abilities to route transactions to issuers over any debit card network these regulations are to be promulgated by the federal reserve board and are expected to take effect in the third quarter of 2011 in december 2010 the federal reserve board released the proposed regulations which set a cap on interchange fees to 012 per transaction on electronic debit card and reloadable generaluse gift card transactions this is a significant reduction from the current per transaction average rate for fis interchange fees are primarily passthrough fees and this change would not have a direct impact to our earnings however it is uncertain what the indirect impact will be on fis as our clients are faced with significant revenue reductions from the interchange rate changes moreover since the regulations implementing the act have not been finalized we are uncertain as to what degree the legislation may affect our business in the future the proposed regulations do not appear to be intended to directly affect interchange fees applicable to credit card transactions but do prohibit networks from “inhibiting” retailers from setting minimum purchase amounts for use of credit cards as long as the minimum does not discriminate among issuers or networks and the minimum is not greater than 10 

  

as a provider of electronic data processing and backoffice services to financial institutions we are also subject to regulatory oversight and examination by the federal financial institutions examination council an interagency body of the federal deposit insurance corporation the office of thrift supervision the office of the comptroller of the currency the board of governors of the federal reserve system the national credit union administration and various state regulatory authorities in addition independent auditors annually review several of our operations to provide reports on internal controls for our customers’ auditors and regulators we are also subject to review under state and foreign laws and rules that regulate many of the same activities that are described above including electronic data processing and backoffice services for financial institutions and use of consumer information 

  

the foregoing list of laws and regulations to which our company is subject is not exhaustive and the regulatory framework governing our operations changes continuously although we do not believe that compliance with future laws and regulations related to our businesses will have a material adverse effect on our company enactment of new laws and regulations may increasingly affect the operations of our business directly and indirectly which could result in substantial regulatory compliance costs litigation expense adverse publicity andor loss of revenue 

  

employees 

  

as of december 31 2010  we had approximately 33000 employees including approximately 19000 employees principally employed outside of the us none of our us workforce currently is unionized approximately 11500 of our employees primarily in brazil and germany are represented by labor unions we consider our relations with employees to be good

 item 1a risk factors 

  

in addition to the normal risks of business we are subject to significant risks and uncertainties including those listed below and others described elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k any of the risks described herein could result in a 

significant adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

  

risks related to our markets and industry 

  

consolidations and business failures in the banking and financial services industry could adversely affect our business by eliminating some of our existing and potential customers and making us more dependent on a more limited number of customers 

  

there has been and continues to be substantial consolidation activity in the banking and financial services industry in addition many financial institutions that experienced negative operating results including some of our customers have failed 

  

the consolidations and failures reduce the number of our potential customers and may reduce the number of our customers which could adversely affect our revenues even if the events do not reduce the aggregate activities of the consolidated entities further if our customers fail andor merge with or are acquired by other entities that are not our customers or that use fewer of our services they may discontinue or reduce use of our services it is also possible that larger financial institutions resulting from consolidations would have greater leverage in negotiating terms or could decide to perform inhouse some or all of the services which we currently provide or could provide any of these developments could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

if we fail to adapt our services to changes in technology or in the marketplace or if our ongoing efforts to upgrade our technology are not successful we could lose customers and have difficulty attracting new customers for our services 

  

the markets for our services are characterized by constant technological changes frequent introductions of new services and evolving industry standards our future success will be significantly affected by our ability to enhance our current services and develop and introduce new services that address the increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers and their clients these initiatives carry the risks associated with any new service development effort including cost overruns delays in delivery and performance issues there can be no assurance that we will be successful in developing marketing and selling new services that meet these changing demands that we will not experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development introduction and marketing of these services or that our new services and their enhancements will adequately meet the demands of the marketplace and achieve market acceptance any of these developments could have an adverse impact on our future revenues andor business prospects 

  

we operate in a competitive business environment and if we are unable to compete effectively our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 

  

the market for our services is intensely competitive our competitors vary in size and in the scope and breadth of the services they offer some of our competitors have substantial resources we face direct competition from third parties and since many of our larger potential customers have historically developed their key applications inhouse and therefore view their system requirements from a makeversusbuy perspective we often compete against our potential customers’ inhouse capacities in addition we expect that the markets in which we compete will continue to attract new competitors and new technologies there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors or that the competitive pressures we face in the markets in which we operate will not materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations see item i business competition 

  

global economic political and other conditions including business cycles and consumer confidence may adversely affect our customers or trends in consumer spending which may adversely impact the demand for our services and our revenue and profitability 

a significant portion of our revenue is derived from transaction processing fees the global transaction processing industries depend heavily upon the overall level of consumer business and government spending any change in economic factors including a sustained deterioration in general economic conditions or consumer confidence particularly in the united states or increases in interest rates in key countries in which we operate may adversely affect consumer spending including related consumer debt reduce check writing change credit and debit card usage and may adversely affect our financial performance by reducing the number or average purchase amount of transactions which we service 

potential customers may be reluctant to switch to a new vendor which may adversely affect our growth 

  

for banks and other potential customers of our financial information software and services switching from one vendor of bank core processing or related software and services or from an internallydeveloped system to a new vendor is a significant 

undertaking many potential customers perceive potential disadvantages such as loss of accustomed functionality increased costs including conversion costs and business disruption as a result potential customers may resist change we seek to overcome this resistance through value enhancing strategies such as a defined conversion process system integration and making ongoing investments to enhance the functionality of our software however there can be no assurance that our strategies for overcoming potential customers’ reluctance to change vendors will be successful and this resistance may adversely affect our growth 

  

the sales and implementation cycles for many of our software and services can be lengthy and require significant investment from both our customers and fis if we fail to close sales or if a customer chooses not to complete an installation after expending significant time and resources to do so our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 

the sales and associated deployment of many of our software or services often involve significant capital commitments by our customers andor fis potential customers generally commit significant resources to an evaluation of available software and services and require us to expend substantial time effort and money educating them as to the value further as part of the sale or deployment of our software and services customers may also require fis to perform significant related services to complete a proof of concept or custom development to meet their needs all of the aforementioned activities may expend significant funds and management resources and ultimately the customer may determine not to close the sale or complete the implementation if we are unsuccessful in closing sales or if the customer decides not to complete an implementation after expending significant funds and management resources or we experience delays it could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

failure to obtain new clients or renew client contracts on favorable terms could result in a lower number or loss of clients and adversely affect results of operations and financial condition 

we may face pricing pressure in obtaining and retaining our larger clients larger clients may be able to seek price reductions from us when they renew a contract when a contract is extended or when the clients business has significant volume changes on some occasions this pricing pressure results in lower revenue from a client than we had anticipated based on our previous agreement with that client this reduction in revenue could result in an adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

further failure to renew client contracts on favorable terms could have an adverse effect on our business our contracts with customers generally run for several years and provide for early termination fees terms are generally renegotiated prior to the end of a contracts term if we are not successful in achieving a high rate of contract renewals on favorable terms our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

risks related to our business and operations 

  

losses consolidations and failures in the financial services industry may impact our ability to borrow funds or the ability of our lenders to fulfill their obligations under our interest rate swap agreements 

  

many financial institutions are currently experiencing negative operating results in some cases these negative operating results have led to financial institution failures andor consolidations including in one instance a lender that is party to our credit agreement and interest rate swap agreements as a result lenders may become insolvent or further tighten lending standards which could in turn make it more difficult or impossible for lenders to perform their obligations under our interest rate swap agreements or for us to borrow under our credit agreement obtain financing on favorable terms or obtain financing or interest rate swap agreements at all our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if a financial institution fails to fulfill its obligations under our interest rate swap agreements or we are unable to draw funds under our credit agreement or obtain other costeffective financing 

  

our existing levels of leverage and debt service requirements may adversely affect our financial and operational flexibility 

  

as of december 31 2010  we had total debt of approximately 52 billion this level of debt could have adverse consequences for our business financial condition operating results and operational flexibility including the following i the debt level may cause us to have difficulty borrowing money in the future for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions or other purposes ii our debt level may limit operational flexibility and our ability to pursue business opportunities and implement certain business strategies iii we use a large portion of our operating cash flow to pay principal and interest on our senior credit facilities which reduces the amount of money available to finance operations acquisitions and other business 

activities repay other indebtedness purchase our outstanding stock and pay shareholder dividends iv some of our debt has a variable rate of interest which exposes us to the risk of increased interest rates and v we have a higher level of debt than some of our competitors or potential competitors which may cause a competitive disadvantage and may reduce flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions including increased competition 

  

we may experience defects development delays installation difficulties system failure or other service disruptions with respect to our technology solutions which would harm our business and reputation and expose us to potential liability 

  

many of our services are based on sophisticated software and computing systems and we may encounter delays when developing new technology solutions and services further the technology solutions underlying our services have occasionally contained and may in the future contain undetected errors or defects when first introduced or when new versions are released in addition we may experience difficulties in installing or integrating our technologies on platforms used by our customers or our customers may cancel a project after we have expended significant effort and resources to complete an installation finally our systems and operations could be exposed to damage or interruption from fire natural disaster power loss telecommunications failure unauthorized entry and computer viruses defects in our technology solutions errors or delays in the processing of electronic transactions or other difficulties could result in i interruption of business operations ii delay in market acceptance iii additional development and remediation costs iv diversion of technical and other resources v loss of customers vi negative publicity or vii exposure to liability claims any one or more of the foregoing could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations although we attempt to limit our potential liability through disclaimers and limitationofliability provisions in our license and customer agreements we cannot be certain that these measures will always be successful in limiting our liability 

  

the doddfrank act may result in business changes for our customers that could have an adverse effect on our financial condition revenues results of operations or prospects for future growth and overall business  

our customers and as a result our associated software and services are required to comply with numerous regulations the doddfrank act and associated durbin amendment were passed and signed into law in 2010 the doddfrank act represents a comprehensive overhaul of the financial services industry within the united states establishes the new federal bureau of consumer financial protection and will require this and other federal agencies to implement many new regulations the durbin amendment could alter the fees charged by card associations and debit networks 

several new regulations and rules will be written and implemented as directed by the aforementioned legislation throughout 2011 and beyond and these new rules and regulations will require our customers or potential customers to comply with new requirements see item i business government regulation for more information regarding certain of these new requirements these new requirements could result in the need for fis to make capital investments to modify our products and services to facilitate our customers and potential customers compliance further requirements of the new regulations could result in changes in our customers business practices that may alter their delivery of services to consumers which could impact the demand for our software and services as well as alter the type or volume of transactions that we process on behalf of our customers as a result the new legislation could have an adverse impact on our financial condition revenues results of operations prospects for future growth and overall business 

many of our customers are subject to a regulatory environment and to industry standards that may change in a manner that reduces the number of transactions in which our customers engage and therefore reduces our revenues 

our customers are subject to a number of government regulations and industry standards with which our services must comply our customers must ensure that our services and related products work within the extensive and evolving regulatory and industry requirements applicable to them federal state foreign or industry authorities could adopt laws rules or regulations affecting our customers businesses that could lead to increased operating costs and could reduce the convenience and functionality of our products and services possibly resulting in reduced market acceptance in addition action by regulatory authorities relating to credit availability data usage privacy or other related regulatory developments could have an adverse effect on our customers and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the doddfrank act and associated durbin amendment passed in 2010 may compound this risk and have an adverse effect on our customers andor impact the type and volume of transactions we process on their behalf and therefore could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our revenues from the sale of services to members of visa mastercard american express discover and other similar organizations are dependent upon our continued certification and sponsorship and the loss or suspension of certification or sponsorship could adversely affect our business 

  

in order to provide our card processing services we must be certified including applicable sponsorship by visa mastercard american express discover and other similar organizations these certifications are dependent upon our continued adherence to the standards of the issuing bodies and sponsoring member banks the member financial institutions some of which are our competitors set the standards with which we must comply if we fail to comply with these standards we could be fined our certifications could be suspended or our registration could be terminated the suspension or termination of our certifications or any changes in the rules and regulations governing visa mastercard american express discover or other similar organizations could prevent our registration or otherwise limit our ability to provide services which could result in a reduction in revenue or increased costs of operation which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business 

changes in card association and debit network fees or products could increase costs or otherwise limit our operations 

from time to time card associations and debit networks increase the interchange fees that they charge it is possible that competitive pressures will result in our absorption of a portion of such increases in the future which would increase our operating costs reduce our profit margin and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operation furthermore the rules and regulations of the various card associations and networks prescribe certain capital requirements any increase in the capital level required would further limit our use of capital for other purposes 

interchange fees and related practices have been receiving significant legal and regulatory scrutiny worldwide the resulting regulatory changes that could occur from proposed regulations such as the durbin amendment could alter the fees charged by card associations and debit networks the impact from the proposed regulations will not be known until the rules are finalized however resulting changes in fees could impact the card issuance or services offered by our customers which could have an adverse impact to our business or financial condition due to reductions or changes in types of transactions processed on behalf of our customers see item i business government regulation for more information 

  

if we fail to comply with applicable regulations or to meet regulatory expectations our business results of operations or financial condition could be adversely impacted 

the majority of our data processing services for financial institutions are not directly subject to federal or state regulations specifically applicable to financial institutions such as banks thrifts and credit unions however as a provider of services to these financial institutions our data processing operations are examined on a regular basis by various federal and state regulatory authorities if we fail to comply with any applicable regulations or guidelines for operations of a data services provider we could be subject to regulatory actions may not meet contractual obligations or suffer harm to our client relationships or reputation failure to meet the aforementioned requirements or to adapt to new requirements at the federal state or international level could inhibit our ability to retain existing customers or obtain new customers which could have an adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

in addition to our data processing services described above we also have business operations that store process or transmit consumer information or have direct relationships with consumers that are obligated to comply with regulations including but not limited to the fair credit reporting act the debt collection practices act and applicable privacy requirements further our international businesses must comply with applicable us laws such as the foreign corrupt practices act failure to maintain compliance with or adapt to changes in any of the aforementioned requirements could result in fines penalties or regulatory actions that could have an adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition 

security breaches or our own failure to comply with privacy regulations and industry security requirements imposed on providers of services to financial institutions and card processing services could harm our business by disrupting our delivery of services and damaging our reputation 

as part of our business we electronically receive process store and transmit sensitive business information of our customers in addition we collect personal consumer data such as names and addresses social security numbers drivers license numbers cardholder data and payment history records to support our customers transaction processing as well as part of our check authorization and collection businesses  the uninterrupted operation of our information systems and the confidentiality of the customerconsumer information that resides on such systems are critical to our successful operation unauthorized access to our computer systems or databases could result in the theft or publication of confidential information the deletion or modification of records or could otherwise cause interruptions in our operations these risks are increased when we transmit information over the internet 

as a provider of services to financial institutions and card processing services we are bound by the same limitations on disclosure of the information we receive from our customers as apply to the customers themselves if we fail to comply with these regulations and industry security requirements we could be exposed to suits for breach of contract governmental 

proceedings or the imposition of fines or prohibitions on card processing services in addition if more restrictive privacy laws rules or industry security requirements are adopted in the future on the federal or state level or by a specific industry body they could have an adverse impact on us through increased costs or restrictions on business processes any inability to prevent security or privacy breaches could cause our existing customers to lose confidence in our systems and terminate their agreements with us and could inhibit our ability to attract new customers andor adversely impact our relationship with administrative agencies 

  

misappropriation of our intellectual property and proprietary rights could impair our competitive position 

  

our ability to compete depends upon proprietary systems and technology despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our services or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary policing unauthorized use of our proprietary rights is difficult we cannot make any assurances that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of technology or that the agreements entered into for that purpose will be enforceable effective trademark service mark copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our applications and services are made available online misappropriation of our intellectual property or potential litigation concerning such matters could have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 

  

if our applications or services are found to infringe the proprietary rights of others we may be required to change our business practices and may also become subject to significant costs and monetary penalties 

  

as our information technology applications and services develop we are increasingly subject to infringement claims any claims whether with or without merit could i be expensive and timeconsuming to defend ii cause us to cease making licensing or using applications that incorporate the challenged intellectual property iii require us to redesign our applications if feasible iv divert management’s attention and resources and v require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements in order to obtain the right to use necessary technologies 

  

we face liability to our merchant customers if checks that we have guaranteed are dishonored by the check writer’s bank 

  

if a check that we have guaranteed is dishonored by the check writer’s bank we must reimburse our merchant customer for the check’s face value and pursue collection of the amount from the check writer in some cases we recognize a liability to our merchant customers for estimated check returns and a receivable for amounts we estimate we will recover from the check writers based on historical experience and other relevant factors the estimated check returns and recovery amounts are subject to the risk that actual amounts returned may exceed our estimates and actual amounts recovered may be less than our estimates 

lack of system integrity fraudulent payments credit quality related to funds settlement or the availability of clearing services could result in a financial loss 

we settle funds on behalf of financial institutions other businesses and consumers and receive funds from clients card issuers payment networks and consumers on a daily basis for a variety of transaction types transactions facilitated by us include debit card credit card electronic bill payment transactions automated clearing house “ach” payments and check clearing that supports consumers financial institutions and other businesses these payment activities rely upon the technology infrastructure that facilitates the verification of activity with counterparties the facilitation of the payment as well as the detection or prevention of fraudulent payments if the continuity of operations integrity of processing or ability to detect or prevent fraudulent payments were compromised this could result in a financial loss to us in addition we rely on various financial institutions to provide ach services in support of funds settlement for certain of our products if we are unable to obtain such ach services in the future that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations in addition we may issue credit to consumers financial institutions or other businesses as part of the funds settlement a default on this credit by a counterparty could result in a financial loss to us 

  

our business is subject to the risks of international operations including movements in foreign currency exchange rates 

  

our international operations represent 17 of total 2010 revenues with approximately 16 or our total revenues conducted in currencies other than the us dollar including the brazilian real british pound and euro as a result our financial condition and operating results could be significantly affected by risks associated with international activities including economic and labor conditions political instability tax laws including us taxes on foreign subsidiaries differences in business practices and changes in the value of the us dollar versus local currencies in addition we are less wellknown internationally than in the united states have less experience with local business conditions and may face challenges in successfully managing small operations located far from our headquarters because of the greater difficulty in overseeing and guiding operations from a distance 

  

as we expand our international operations more of our customers may pay us in foreign currencies conducting business in currencies other than us dollars subjects us to fluctuations in currency exchange rates our primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relate to foreign currencies in brazil europe australia and parts of asia the us dollar value of our net investments in foreign operations the periodic conversion of foreigndenominated earnings to the us dollar our reporting currency our results of operations and in some cases cash flows could be adversely affected in a material manner by movements in foreign currency exchange rates these risks could cause an adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations 

  

failure to attract and retain skilled technical employees or senior management personnel could harm our ability to grow 

  

our future success depends upon our ability to attract and retain highlyskilled technical personnel because the development of our products and services requires knowledge of computer hardware operating system software system management software and application software our technical personnel must be proficient in a number of disciplines competition for such technical personnel is intense and our failure to hire and retain talented personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

  

our future growth will also require sales and marketing financial and administrative personnel to develop and support new products and services to enhance and support current products and services and to expand operational and financial systems there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain the necessary personnel to accomplish our growth strategies and we may experience constraints that could adversely affect our ability to satisfy client demand in a timely fashion 

  

our senior management team has significant experience in the financial services industry either at fis or with clients or competitors and the loss of this leadership could have an adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

  

we are the subject of various legal proceedings that could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability 

  

we are routinely involved in various litigation matters including in some cases classaction litigation and also are involved in or the subject of governmental or regulatory agency inquiries or investigations from time to time if we are unsuccessful in our defense in the litigation matters or any other legal proceeding we may be forced to pay damages or fines andor change our business practices any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

unfavorable resolution of tax contingencies could adversely affect our tax expense 

our tax returns and positions are subject to review and audit by federal state local and international taxing authorities an unfavorable outcome to a tax audit could result in higher tax expense and could negatively impact our effective tax rate financial position results of operations and cash flows in the current andor future periods 

the chairman of our board of directors and other officers and directors have interests and positions that could present potential conflicts 

  

we and certain of our subsidiaries are parties to a variety of related party agreements and relationships with fnf and lps william p foley ii who is our chairman is currently the chairman of the board of directors of fnf brent b bickett and michael l gravelle who are executive officers of fis are also executive officers of fnf william p foley ii brent b bickett and michael l gravelle also own or hold substantial amounts of fnf stock and stock options thomas m hagerty and richard n massey who are both directors of fis are also directors of fnf david k hunt a director of fis is also a director of lps as a result of the foregoing there may be circumstances where certain of our executive officers and directors may be subject to conflicts of interest with respect to among other things i our ongoing relationships with fnf and lps including related party agreements and other arrangements with respect to the administration of tax matters employee benefits and indemnification ii the quality pricing and other terms associated with services that we provide to fnf and lps or that they provide to us under related party agreements iii business opportunities arising for either us fnf or lps that could be pursued by either us or by fnf or lps and iv conflicts of time with respect to matters potentially or actually involving or affecting fis 

  

we seek to manage these potential conflicts through abstention oversight by independent members of our board of directors and provisions in our agreements with fnf and lps however there can be no assurance that such measures will be 

effective or that we will be able to resolve all potential conflicts with fnf and lps or that the resolution of any such conflicts will be no less favorable to us than if we were dealing with an unaffiliated third party 

our agreements with related parties may be more or less favorable than agreements negotiated at armslength with independent parties 

we have entered into various agreements with certain related parties including without limitation fnf and ceridian corporation pursuant to which we will provide services to each such related party as a client we believe the amounts earned from or charged by us under each such arrangement is fair and reasonable and that our service arrangements are priced within the range of prices we offer to third parties however the amounts we earned or that were charged under these arrangements were not negotiated at armslength and may not represent the terms that we might have obtained from an unrelated third party for similar services any inferior terms that such agreements may contain as compared to agreements negotiated with unrelated third parties may have an adverse impact on our results of operations 

  

risks related to business combinations 

  

if we are unable to successfully consummate and integrate acquisitions our results of operations may be adversely affected 

  

we have made numerous acquisitions in recent years as a part of our growth strategy we anticipate that we will continue to seek to acquire complementary businesses and services this strategy will depend on the ability to find suitable acquisitions and finance them on acceptable terms we may require additional debt or equity financing for future acquisitions and doing so may be made more difficult by our existing debt if we are unable to acquire suitable acquisition candidates we may experience slower growth further after successfully completing acquisitions we face challenges in integrating acquired businesses these challenges include eliminating redundant operations facilities and systems coordinating management and personnel retaining key employees managing different corporate cultures and achieving cost reductions and crossselling opportunities there can be no assurance that we will be able to fully integrate all aspects of acquired businesses successfully or fully realize the potential benefits of bringing them together and the process of integrating these acquisitions may disrupt our business and divert our resources 

  

we have substantial investments in recorded goodwill and other intangible assets as a result of prior acquisitions and a severe or extended economic downturn could cause these investments to become impaired requiring writedowns that would reduce our operating income 

  

as of december 31 2010  goodwill aggregated to 85500 million or 604 of total assets and other indefinite lived intangible assets aggregated to 905 million or 06 of total assets current accounting rules require goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets to be assessed for impairment at least annually or whenever changes in circumstances indicate potential impairment factors that may be considered a change in circumstance include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results a significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization and negative industry or economic trends the results of our fiscal year 2010 annual assessment of the recoverability of goodwill indicated that the fair values of the company’s reporting units were in excess of the carrying values of those reporting units and thus no goodwill impairment existed as of december 31 2010  additionally the fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets was in excess of the carrying value of those assets however if worldwide or united states economic conditions decline significantly with negative impacts to bank spending and consumer behavior  or if other business or market changes impact our outlook  the carrying amount of our goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets may no longer be recoverable and we may be required to record an impairment charge which would have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition we will continue to monitor the fair value of our other indefinite lived intangible assets as well as our market capitalization and the impact of any economic downturn on our business to determine if there is an impairment in future periods

indemnifications and warranties 

the company often indemnifies its customers against damages and costs resulting from claims of patent copyright or trademark infringement associated with use of its software through software licensing agreements historically the company has not made any significant payments under such indemnifications but continues to monitor the conditions that are subject to the indemnifications to identify whether it is probable that a loss has occurred and would recognize any such losses when they are estimable in addition the company warrants to customers that its software operates substantially in accordance with the software specifications historically no significant costs have been incurred related to software warranties and no accruals for warranty costs have been made

this section should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes of fis included elsewhere in this annual report this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forwardlooking statements see “forwardlooking statements” and “risk factors” for a discussion of the uncertainties risks and assumptions associated with these forwardlooking statements that could cause future results to differ materially from those reflected in this section 

  

overview 

  

fis is one of the worlds largest global providers dedicated to banking and payments technologies we offer financial institution core processing card issuer and transaction processing services including the nyce network fis is a member of standard and poor’s sp 500 ® index and consistently holds a leading ranking in the annual fintech 100 rankings as of december 31 2010  fis has more than 300 solutions serving over 14000 financial institutions and business customers in over 100 countries spanning all segments of the financial services industry we have four reporting segments fsg psg isg and corporate and other a description of these segments is included above in item 1 revenues by segment and the results of operations of our segments are discussed below in segment results of operations 

  

business trends and conditions 

  

approximately 85 of our revenue historically is considered recurring which provides relative stability to our revenue stream however the condition of the overall economy can affect our revenue growth in a number of areas a significant portion of our revenue is derived from transaction processing fees as a result lower deposit and card transactions associated with reduced consumer and commercial activity will adversely impact revenue in addition sales of software licenses and professional services which have represented approximately 15 of our revenue can be regarded as discretionary spending by our customers and may contract when their capital budgets tighten in light of the challenging revenue environment we have been seeking to manage our costs and capital expenditures prudently 

  

we completed the metavante technologies inc acquisition the metavante acquisition on october 1 2009 the combined company is positioned to provide a comprehensive range of integrated solutions to its customers and has greater geographic reach than any other provider in the industry which will enhance service to the combined company’s customers management expects to continue to realize incremental cost and revenue synergies through 2011 as a result of the metavante acquisition however the impact of these synergies on yearoveryear trends for 2011 vs 2010 will be less   

  

we acquired capco in december 2010 to broaden our capabilities to provide strategic consulting while this will generate increased revenues the lower profit margins realized for professional services as compared to our other solutions will result in some level of profit margin compression the addition of capco will also reduce the relative proportion of our recurring revenue stream in 2011   

  

as the payment market continues to evolve from paperbased to electronic we continue to add new services responsive to this trend card transactions continue to increase as a percentage of total pointofsale payments which fuels continuing demand for cardrelated services in recent years we have added a variety of storedvalue card types internet banking and electronic bill presentmentpayment services as well as a number of card enhancement and loyaltyreward programs the common goal of these offerings continues to be convenience and security for the consumer coupled with value to the financial institution the evolution to electronic transactions also intensifies the vulnerability to fraud increasing the demand for our risk management solutions at the same time the use of checks continues to decline as a percentage of total pointofsale payments which negatively impacts our check warranty and itemprocessing businesses 

  

we compete for both licensing and outsourcing business and thus are affected by the decisions of financial institutions to utilize our services under an outsourced arrangement or to process inhouse under a software license and maintenance agreement as a provider of outsourcing solutions we benefit from multiyear recurring revenue streams which help moderate the effects of yeartoyear economic changes on our results of operations one of the current trends we expect to benefit from in the financial services industry is the migration to an outsourced model to improve profitability 

  

consolidation within the banking industry may be beneficial or detrimental to our businesses when consolidations occur merger partners often operate disparate systems licensed from competing service providers the newly formed entity generally makes a determination to migrate its core and payments systems to a single platform when a financial institution processing client is involved in a consolidation we may benefit by expanding the use of our services if such services are chosen to survive the consolidation and support the newly combined entity conversely we may lose market share if a customer of ours is involved in a consolidation and our services are not chosen to survive the consolidation and support the newly combined entity we seek to mitigate the risks of consolidations by offering other competitive services to take advantage of specific opportunities at the surviving company 

  

while we are cautious regarding broader economic improvement we expect banks to continue investing in new technology and believe we are well positioned to capitalize as the overall market continues to recover we expect bank failures to continue in the next few years and have recently seen increased bank consolidation activity and expect this to continue in 2011 to date bank failures and forced government actions that have occurred have not been significant to our revenues however continuing or escalating bank failures and forced government actions could negatively impact our business this exposure may be mitigated by incremental revenues we may generate from license fees or services associated with assisting surviving institutions with integrating acquired assets resulting from financial failures 

  

for an update on our brazilian outsourced cardprocessing venture the brazilian venture see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

critical accounting policies 

  

the accounting policies described below are those we consider critical in preparing our consolidated financial statements these policies require management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures with respect to contingent liabilities and assets at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods actual amounts could differ from those estimates see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed description of the significant accounting policies that have been followed in preparing our consolidated financial statements 

  

revenue recognition 

  

the company generates revenues from the delivery of bank processing credit and debit card processing services other payment processing services professional services software licensing and software related services and products revenues are recognized when evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred fees are fixed or determinable and collection is considered probable we are frequently a party to multiple concurrent contracts with the same customer these situations require judgment to determine whether the individual contracts should be aggregated or evaluated separately for purposes of revenue recognition in making this determination we consider the timing of negotiating and executing the contracts whether the different elements of the contracts are interdependent and whether any of the payment terms of the contracts are interrelated due to the large number broad nature and average size of individual contracts we are party to the impact of judgments and assumptions that we apply in recognizing revenue for any single contract is not likely to have a material effect on our consolidated operations or financial position however the broader accounting policy assumptions that we apply across similar arrangements or classes of customers could significantly influence the timing and amount of revenue recognized in our historical and future results of operations or financial position additional information about our revenue recognition policies is included in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

allowance for doubtful accounts 

  

the company analyzes trade accounts receivable by considering historical bad debts customer creditworthiness current economic trends changes in customer payment terms and collection trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts any change in the assumptions used may result in an additional allowance for doubtful accounts being recognized in the period in which the change occurs the allowance for doubtful accounts was 331 million and 418 million at december 31 2010 and 2009  respectively 

  

reserves for check guarantee losses 

  

in our check guarantee business if a guaranteed check presented to a merchant customer is dishonored by the check writer’s bank we reimburse our merchant customer for the check’s face value and pursue collection of the amount from the delinquent check writer loss reserves and anticipated recoveries are primarily determined by performing a historical analysis 

of our check loss and recovery experience and considering other factors that could affect that experience in the future such factors include the general economy the overall industry mix of our customer volumes statistical analysis of check fraud trends within our customer volumes and the quality of returned checks once these factors are considered we establish a rate for check losses that is calculated by dividing the expected check losses by dollar volume processed and a rate for anticipated recoveries that is calculated by dividing the anticipated recoveries by the total amount of related check losses these rates are then applied against the dollar volume processed and check losses respectively each month and charged to costs of revenues the estimated check returns and recovery amounts are subject to risk that actual amounts returned and recovered may be different than our estimates 

  

historically such estimation processes have proved to be materially accurate however our projections of probable check guarantee losses and anticipated recoveries are inherently uncertain and as a result we cannot predict with certainty the amount of such items changes in economic conditions the risk characteristics and composition of our customers and other factors could impact our actual and projected amounts we recorded check guarantee losses net of anticipated recoveries excluding service fees of 694 million and 833 million respectively for the years ended december 31 2010 and 2009  a ten percent difference in our estimated check guarantee loss reserve net of estimated recoveries as of december 31 2010 would have impacted 2010 net earnings by less than 20 million aftertax 

  

computer software 

  

computer software includes the fair value of software acquired in business combinations purchased software and capitalized software development costs as of december 31 2010 and 2009  computer software net of accumulated amortization was 9090 million and 9327 million respectively purchased software is recorded at cost and amortized using the straight line method over its estimated useful life and software acquired in business combinations is recorded at its fair value and amortized using straight line and accelerated methods over its estimated useful life in determining useful lives management considers historical results and technological trends which may influence the estimate useful lives for all computer software range from 3 to 10 years amortization expense for computer software was 1951 million 1498 million and 1499 million in 2010  2009 and 2008  respectively included in discontinued operations in the consolidated statement of earnings was amortization expense on computer software of 33 million 07 million and 153 million for 2010  2009 and 2008  respectively we also assess the recorded value of computer software for impairment on a regular basis by comparing the carrying value to the estimated future cash flows to be generated by the underlying software asset there are inherent uncertainties in determining the expected useful life or cash flows to be generated from computer software while we have not historically experienced significant changes in these estimates we could be subject to such changes in the future 

  

goodwill and other intangible assets 

  

we are required to allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction at their estimated fair values the estimates used to determine the fair value of longlived assets such as intangible assets are complex and require a significant amount of management judgment we generally engage independent valuation specialists to assist us in making fair value determinations we are also required to estimate the useful lives of intangible assets to determine the amount of acquisitionrelated intangible asset amortization expense to record in future periods we periodically review the estimated useful lives assigned to our definitelived intangible assets to determine whether such estimated useful lives continue to be appropriate additionally we review our indefinitelived intangible assets to determine if there is any change in circumstances that may indicate the asset’s useful life is no longer indefinite 

  

we review the carrying value of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable the authoritative guidance requires us to perform a twostep impairment test on goodwill first we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value we determine the fair value of our reporting units based on a weighted average of multiple valuation techniques principally a combination of an income approach and a market approach the income approach calculates a value based upon the present value of estimated future cash flows while the market approach utilizes earnings multiples of similarly situated guideline public companies if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the reporting unit’s net assets goodwill is not impaired and further testing is not required if the carrying value of the reporting unit’s net assets exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit then we perform the second step of the impairment test to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill and any impairment charge additionally we estimate the fair value of acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives and compare this amount to the underlying carrying value 

  

determining the fair value of a reporting unit or acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives involves judgment and the use of significant estimates and assumptions which include assumptions regarding the revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate estimated future cash flows riskadjusted discount rates and future economic and market conditions 

and other assumptions 

  

during the year ended december 31 2010  the portion of the unamortized contract intangible asset recorded at the initiation of the brazilian venture that was attributable to banco santander was deemed impaired due to the exit of banco santander accordingly we recorded a pretax impairment charge of 1403 million in the third quarter of 2010  in addition we recorded a 52 million impairment of intangible assets related to the discontinued operations of participacoes as discussed in notes 3 and 9 to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2009  our analysis of indefinitelived intangible assets indicated an impairment of certain trademarks which were discontinued as a result of the company’s rebranding campaign initiated on october 1 2009 following the acquisition of metavante accordingly we recorded a pretax impairment charge of 1240 million in the fourth quarter of 2009  during the year ended december 31 2008  we recorded a pretax impairment charge of 520 million to reduce the carrying value of a trademark related to our retail check business to its estimated fair value and included approximately 260 million of this charge in discontinued operations given the significance of our goodwill and intangible asset balances an adverse change in fair value could result in an impairment charge which could be material to our financial statements

as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements we are required to determine income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate this process involves estimating actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing recognition of items for income tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred income tax assets and liabilities which are included within the consolidated balance sheets we must then assess the likelihood that deferred income tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely establish a valuation allowance to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period we must reflect this increase as an expense within income tax expense in the consolidated statements of earnings determination of the income tax expense requires estimates and can involve complex issues that may require an extended period to resolve further changes in the geographic mix of revenues or in the estimated level of annual pretax income can cause the overall effective income tax rate to vary from period to period we believe that our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that we adequately provide for any known tax contingencies we believe the estimates and assumptions used to support our evaluation of tax benefit realization are reasonable however final determination of prioryear tax liabilities either by settlement with tax authorities or expiration of statutes of limitations could be materially different than estimates reflected in assets and liabilities and historical income tax provisions the outcome of these final determinations could have a material effect on our income tax provision net income or cash flows in the period that determination is made

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risks 

  

market risk 

  

we are exposed to market risks primarily from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates we use certain derivative financial instruments including interest rate swaps and foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage interest rate and foreign currency risk we do not use derivatives for trading purposes to generate income or to engage in speculative activity 

interest rate risk 

in addition to existing cash balances and cash provided by operating activities we use fixed rate and variable rate debt to finance our operations we are exposed to interest rate risk on these debt obligations and related interest rate swaps 

the notes represent substantially all of our fixedrate longterm debt obligations the carrying value of the notes was 11000 million at december 31 2010 the fair value of the notes was approximately 11723 million at december 31 2010 the potential reduction in fair value of the notes from a hypothetical 10 percent increase in market interest rates would not be material to the overall fair value of the debt we currently have no plans to repurchase the notes before their maturity and therefore fluctuations in market interest rates would not have an effect on our results of operations or financial condition 

  

our floating rate longterm debt obligations principally relate to borrowings under the fis credit agreement as of december 31 2010  we are paying interest on our term loan a1 of libor plus 100 on our term loan a2 of libor plus an applicable margin of up to 250 based upon the companys leverage ratio as defined in the fis credit agreement and on our term loan b at generally libor plus 375 with libor subject to a 150 floor prior to the june 29 2010 amendment and extension interest on the revolving loan was payable at libor plus up to 100 eurocurrency borrowings fedfunds plus up to 100 swingline borrowings or prime plus 000 base rate borrowings plus a facility fee of up to 025 the preamendment pricing continues to apply for the portion of the revolving loan that matures in january 2012 consisting of approximately 1123 million of commitments interest on the portion of the revolving loan that matures in july 2014 is generally payable at libor plus an applicable margin of up to 250 based upon the companys leverage ratio and is subject to an unused commitment fee of 050 an increase of 100 basis points in the libor rate would increase our annual debt service under these credit agreements after we include the impact of our interest rate swaps by 34 million based on principal amounts outstanding at december 31 2010  we performed the foregoing sensitivity analysis based on the principal amount of our floating rate debt as of december 31 2010  less the principal amount of such debt that was then subject to an interest rate swap converting such debt into fixed rate debt this sensitivity analysis is based solely on the principal amount of such debt as of december 31 2010  and does not take into account any changes that occurred in the prior 12 months or that may take place in the next 12 months in the amount of our outstanding debt or in the notional amount of outstanding interest rate swaps in respect of our debt further in this sensitivity analysis the change in interest rates is assumed to be applicable for an entire year for comparison purposes based on principal amounts on the revolving loan and term loan a outstanding as of december 31 2009  and calculated in the same manner as set forth above an increase of 100 basis points in the libor rate would have increased our annual interest expense after we calculate the impact of our interest rate swaps by 70 million 

  

we use interest rate swaps for the purpose of managing our interest expense through the mix of fixed rate and floating rate debt as of december 31 2010  we have entered into the following interest rate swap transactions converting a portion of the interest rate exposure on our term and revolving loans from variable to fixed in millions 

  



 

 we have designated these interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes a portion of the amount included in accumulated other comprehensive earnings is reclassified into interest expense as a yield adjustment as interest payments are made on the term and revolving loans in accordance with the authoritative guidance for fair value measurements the inputs used to determine the estimated fair value of our interest rate swaps are level 2type measurements we considered our own credit risk and the credit risk of the counterparties when determining the fair value of our interest rate swaps 

  

foreign currency risk 

we are exposed to foreign currency risks that arise from normal business operations these risks include the translation of local currency balances of foreign subsidiaries transaction gains and losses associated with intercompany loans with foreign subsidiaries and transactions denominated in currencies other than a locations functional currency our objective is to minimize our exposure to these risks through a combination of normal operating activities and the use of foreign currency forward exchange contracts contracts are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries 

our exposure to foreign currency exchange risks generally arises from our nonus operations to the extent they are conducted in local currency changes in foreign currency exchange rates affect translations of revenues denominated in currencies other than the us dollar our international operations generated approximately 8337 million in revenues excluding the termination fee of 833 million paid by banco santander to exit the brazilian venture during the year ended december 31 2010  of which approximately 7092 million were denominated in currencies other than the us dollar the major currencies to which we are exposed are the brazilian real the euro and the british pound sterling a 10 move in average exchange rates for these currencies assuming a simultaneous and immediate 10 change in all of such rates for the relevant period would have resulted in the following increase or decrease in our reported revenues for the years ended december 31 2010 and 2009 in millions 

  



the impact on earnings of the foregoing assumed 10 change in each of the periods presented would not have been significant 

our foreign exchange risk management policy permits the use of derivative instruments such as forward contracts and 

options to reduce volatility in our results of operations andor cash flows resulting from foreign exchange rate fluctuations our international operations revenues and expenses are generally denominated in local currency which limits the economic exposure to foreign exchange risk in those jurisdictions we do not enter into foreign currency derivative instruments for trading purposes during 2010 we entered into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency exposure to intercompany loans at december 31 2010 the notional amount of these derivatives was approximately 565 million and the fair value was nominal these derivatives are intended to hedge the foreign exchange risks related to intercompany loans but have not been designated as hedges for accounting purposes

general development of the business 

 

our business operations and organizational structure result from the february 1 2006 business combination of fis and certegy the “certegy merger” pursuant to which fis was merged into a whollyowned subsidiary of certegy immediately after the certegy merger the stockholders of fis owned approximately 674 of the company’s outstanding common stock accordingly for accounting and financial reporting purposes the certegy merger was treated as a reverse acquisition of certegy by fis using the purchase method of accounting under this accounting treatment although certegy was the legal entity that survived the merger fis was viewed as the acquirer for accounting purposes and our financial statements and other disclosures for periods prior to the certegy merger treat fis as our predecessor company also as a result of the certegy merger the registrant’s name changed from “certegy inc” to “fidelity national information services inc” and our new york stock exchange trading symbol from “cey” to “fis” we are incorporated under the laws of the state of georgia where certegy was initially incorporated on march 2 2001 

on november 9 2006 old fnf then the majority stockholder of fis after other transactions in which it distributed all of its assets other than its ownership in fis merged with and into fis the “fnf merger” upon completion of the fnf merger fis became an independent publicly traded company and old fnf ceased to exist as an independent publicly traded company the assets distributed by old fnf prior to the fnf merger included its ownership in fnt which following the fnf merger renamed itself fidelity national financial inc

patents trademarks and other intellectual property 

 

we rely on a combination of contractual restrictions internal security practices and applicable law to establish and protect our software technology and expertise worldwide we rely on trademark law to protect our rights in those brands while we intend to continue taking appropriate measures to protect our intellectual property rights these legal protections and arrangements afford only limited protection and there is no assurance that our competitors will not independently develop or license products services or capabilities that are substantially equivalent or superior to ours in general we own the proprietary rights necessary for the conduct of our business although we do license certain items from third parties under armslength agreements for varying terms 

 

competition 

 

our primary competitors include internal technology departments within financial institutions and retailers data processing or software development departments of large companies or large computer manufacturers thirdparty payment processors independent computer services firms companies that develop and deploy software applications companies that provide customized development implementation and support services and companies that market software for the financial services industry some of these competitors possess substantially greater financial sales and marketing resources than we do competitive factors impacting the success of our services include the quality of the technologybased application or service application features and functions ease of delivery and integration ability of the provider to maintain enhance and support the applications or services and price we believe that we compete favorably in each of these categories in addition we believe that our financial institution industry expertise combined with our ability to offer multiple applications services and integrated solutions to individual customers enhances our competitiveness against companies with more limited offerings specific competitors for both financial and payment solutions include fiserv inc and jack henry and associates inc in the core processing market we also compete with open solutions inc international business machines corporation ibm accenture ltd alliance data systems corporation dst systems harland financial solutions inc sei investments company s1corporation sungard data systems inc and in certain nonus markets alnova technologies corporation iflex solutions limited nka oracle financial services software limited misys plc infosys technologies limited and temenos group ag our competitors in the card services market include mastercard incorporated visa inc and thirdparty credit and debit card processors such as first data corporation total system services inc hp enterprise services and payment systems for credit unions pscu competitors in the check risk management services market include first data corporation’s telecheck services division heartland payments systems inc total systems services inc and global payments inc 

 

research and development 

 

our research and development activities have related primarily to the design and development of processing systems and related software applications and risk management platforms we expect to continue our practice of investing an appropriate level of resources to maintain enhance and extend the functionality of our proprietary systems and existing software applications to develop new and innovative software applications and systems in response to the needs of our customers and to enhance the capabilities surrounding our outsourcing infrastructure in addition we intend to offer services that are compatible with new and emerging delivery channels 

 

as part of our research and development process we evaluate current and emerging technology for compatibility with our existing and future software platforms to this end we engage with various hardware and software vendors in evaluation of various infrastructure components where appropriate we use thirdparty technology components in the development of our software applications and service offerings thirdparty software may be used for highly specialized business functions which we may not be able to develop internally within time and budget constraints additionally thirdparty software may be used for commodity type functions within a technology platform environment in the case of nearly all of our thirdparty software enterprise license agreements 

exist for the thirdparty component and either alternative suppliers exist or transfer rights exist to ensure the continuity of supply as a result we are not materially dependent upon any thirdparty technology components we work with our customers to determine the appropriate timing and approach to introducing technology or infrastructure changes to our applications and services in the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 approximately 2 to 3 of revenues were invested in research and development efforts excluding amounts capitalized 

 

government regulation 

 

our services are subject to a broad range of complex federal state and foreign regulation including federal truthinlending and truthinsavings rules regulation aa unfair or deceptive acts or practices privacy laws usury laws the equal credit opportunity act the electronic funds transfer act the fair credit reporting act the fair debt collection practices act the bank secrecy act the usa patriot act the internal revenue code the employee retirement income security act the health insurance portability and accountability act and the community reinvestment act the compliance of our services with these and other applicable laws and regulations depends on a variety of factors including the manner in which our clients use them our clients are contractually responsible for determining what is required of them under applicable laws and regulations so that we can assist them in their compliance efforts the failure of our services to comply with applicable laws and regulations could result in restrictions on our ability to provide them as well as the imposition of civil fines andor criminal penalties the four principal areas of regulation impacting our business are 

 

  

as a provider of electronic data processing and backoffice services to financial institutions we are also subject to regulatory oversight and examination by the federal financial institutions examination council an interagency body of the federal deposit insurance corporation the office of thrift supervision the office of the comptroller 

of the currency the board of governors of the federal reserve system the national credit union administration and various state regulatory authorities in addition independent auditors annually review several of our operations to provide reports on internal controls for our customers’ auditors and regulators we are also subject to review under state and foreign laws and rules that regulate many of the same activities that are described above including electronic data processing and backoffice services for financial institutions and use of consumer information 

 

the foregoing list of laws and regulations to which our company is subject is not exhaustive and the regulatory framework governing our operations changes continuously although we do not believe that compliance with future laws and regulations related to our businesses will have a material adverse effect on our company enactment of new laws and regulations may increasingly affect the operations of our business directly and indirectly which could result in substantial regulatory compliance costs litigation expense adverse publicity andor loss of revenue

tablestart 


 item 1a   risk factors tableend  

in addition to the normal risks of business we are subject to significant risks and uncertainties including those listed below and others described elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k any of the risks described herein could result in a significant adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

 

risks related to our markets and industry 

 

consolidations and failures in the banking and financial services industry could adversely affect our business by eliminating some of our existing and potential customers and making us more dependent on a more limited number of customers 

 

there has been and continues to be substantial consolidation activity in the banking and financial services industry in addition many financial institutions that experienced negative operating results including some of our customers have failed 

 

the consolidations and failures reduce the number of our customers and potential customers which could adversely affect our revenues even if the events do not reduce the aggregate activities of the consolidated entities further if our customers fail andor merge with or are acquired by other entities that are not our customers or that use fewer of our services they may discontinue or reduce use of our services it is also possible that larger financial institutions resulting from consolidations would have greater leverage in negotiating terms or could decide to perform inhouse some or all of the services which we currently provide or could provide any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

if we fail to adapt our services to changes in technology or in the marketplace or if our ongoing efforts to upgrade our technology are not successful we could lose customers and have difficulty attracting new customers for our services 

 

the markets for our services are characterized by constant technological changes frequent introductions of new services and evolving industry standards our future success will be significantly affected by our ability to enhance our current services and develop and introduce new services that address the increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers and their clients these initiatives carry the risks associated with any new service development effort including cost overruns delays in delivery and performance issues there can be no assurance that we will be successful in developing marketing and selling new services that meet these changing demands that we will not experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development introduction and marketing of these services or that our new services and their enhancements will adequately meet the demands of the marketplace and achieve market acceptance any of these developments could have an adverse impact on our future revenues andor business prospects 

 

we operate in a competitive business environment and if we are unable to compete effectively our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 

 

the market for our services is intensely competitive our competitors vary in size and in the scope and breadth of the services they offer some of our competitors have substantial resources we face direct competition from third parties and since many of our larger potential customers have historically developed their key applications inhouse and therefore view their system requirements from a makeversusbuy perspective we often compete against our potential customers’ inhouse capacities in addition we expect that the markets in which we compete will continue to attract new competitors and new technologies there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors or that the competitive pressures we face in the markets in which we operate will not materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

potential customers may be reluctant to switch to a new vendor which may adversely affect our growth both in the us and internationally 

 

for banks and other potential customers of our financial information software and services switching from one vendor of bank core processing or related software and services or from an internallydeveloped system to a new vendor is a significant undertaking many potential customers perceive potential disadvantages such as loss of accustomed functionality increased costs including conversion costs and business disruption as a result potential customers both in the us and internationally may resist change we seek to overcome this resistance through value enhancing strategies such as a defined conversion process system integration and making ongoing investments to enhance the functionality of our software however there can be no assurance that our strategies for overcoming potential customers’ reluctance to change vendors will be successful and this resistance may adversely affect our growth both in the us and internationally 

 

demand for many of our services is sensitive to the level of consumer transactions generated by our customers and accordingly our revenues could be impacted negatively by business cycles consumer confidence or any other event causing a material slowing of consumer spending 

 

a significant portion of our revenue is derived from transaction processing fees any changes in economic factors or consumer confidence such as the current recession that adversely affect consumer spending and related consumer debt or a reduction in check writing or credit and debit card usage could reduce the volume of transactions that we process and have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we have a long sales cycle for many of our applications and if we fail to close sales after expending significant time and resources to do so our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 

 

the implementation of many of our applications often involves significant capital commitments by our customers particularly those with smaller operational scale potential customers generally commit significant resources to an evaluation of available software and require us to expend substantial time effort and money educating them as to the value of our software and services our sales cycle may be extended due to our customers’ budgetary constraints or for other reasons we may expend significant funds and management resources during the sales cycle and ultimately fail to close the sale if we are unsuccessful in closing sales after expending significant funds and management resources or we experience delays it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

risks related to our business and operations 

 

losses consolidations and failures in the financial services industry may impact our ability to borrow funds or the ability of our lenders to fulfill their obligations under our interest rate swap agreements 

 

many financial institutions are currently experiencing negative operating results in some cases these negative operating results have led to financial institution failures andor consolidations including in one instance a lender that is party to our credit agreement and interest rate swap agreements as a result lenders may become insolvent or further tighten lending standards which could in turn make it more difficult or impossible for lenders to perform their obligations under our interest rate swap agreements or for us to borrow under our credit agreement obtain financing on favorable terms or obtain financing or interest rate swap agreements at all our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if a financial institution fails to fulfill its obligations under our interest rate swap agreements or we are unable to draw funds under our credit agreement or obtain other costeffective financing 

 

our existing levels of leverage and debt service requirements may adversely affect our financial and operational flexibility 

 

as of december 31 2009 we had total debt of approximately 33 billion this level of debt could have adverse consequences for our business financial condition operating results and operational flexibility including the following i the debt level may cause us to have difficulty borrowing money in the future for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions or other purposes ii limiting operational flexibility and our ability to pursue other business opportunities and implement certain business strategies iii we use a large portion of our operating cash flow to pay principal and interest on our senior credit facilities which reduces the amount of money available to finance operations acquisitions and other business activities repay other indebtedness purchase our outstanding stock and pay shareholder dividends iv some of our debt has a variable rate of interest which exposes us to the risk of increased interest rates and v we have a higher level of debt than some of our competitors or potential competitors which may cause a competitive disadvantage and may reduce flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions including increased competition 

 

in addition the terms of our senior credit facilities may restrict us from taking actions such as making significant acquisitions or dispositions or entering into certain agreements which we might believe to be advantageous to us 

 

we may experience defects development delays installation difficulties system failure or other service disruptions with respect to our technology solutions which would harm our business and reputation and expose us to potential liability 

 

many of our services are based on sophisticated software and computing systems and we may encounter delays when developing new technology solutions and services further the technology solutions underlying our services have occasionally contained and may in the future contain undetected errors or defects when first introduced or when new versions are released in addition we may experience difficulties in installing or integrating our technologies on platforms used by our customers finally our systems and operations could be exposed to 

damage or interruption from fire natural disaster power loss telecommunications failure unauthorized entry and computer viruses defects in our technology solutions errors or delays in the processing of electronic transactions or other difficulties could result in i interruption of business operations ii delay in market acceptance iii additional development and remediation costs iv diversion of technical and other resources v loss of customers vi negative publicity or vii exposure to liability claims 

 

any one or more of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations although we attempt to limit our potential liability through disclaimers and limitationofliability provisions in our license and customer agreements we cannot be certain that these measures will always be successful in limiting our liability 

 

our revenues from the sale of services to members of visa mastercard american express discover and other similar organizations are dependent upon our continued certification and sponsorship and the loss or suspension of certification or sponsorship could adversely affect our business 

 

in order to provide our card processing services we must be certified including applicable sponsorship by visa mastercard american express discover and other similar organizations these certifications are dependent upon our continued adherence to the standards of the issuing bodies and sponsoring member banks the member financial institutions some of which are our competitors set the standards with which we must comply if we fail to comply with these standards we could be fined our certifications could be suspended or our registration could be terminated the suspension or termination of our certifications or any changes in the rules and regulations governing visa mastercard american express discover or other similar organizations could prevent our registration or otherwise limit our ability to provide services which could result in a reduction in revenue or increased costs of operation which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business 

 

many of our customers are subject to a regulatory environment and to industry standards that may change in a manner that reduces the number of transactions in which our customers engage and therefore reduces our revenues 

 

our customers are subject to a number of government regulations and industry standards with which our services must comply our customers must ensure that our services and related products work within the extensive and evolving regulatory and industry requirements applicable to them federal state foreign or industry authorities could adopt laws rules or regulations affecting our customers’ businesses which could lead to increased operating costs and could reduce the convenience and functionality of our products and services possibly resulting in reduced market acceptance in addition action by regulatory authorities relating to credit availability data usage privacy or other related regulatory developments could have an adverse effect on our customers and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

security breaches or our own failure to comply with privacy regulations and industry security requirements imposed on providers of services to financial institutions and card processing services could harm our business by disrupting our delivery of services and damaging our reputation 

 

as part of our business we electronically receive process store and transmit sensitive business information of our customers in addition we collect personal consumer data such as names and addresses social security numbers driver’s license numbers cardholder data and payment history records unauthorized access to our computer systems or databases could result in the theft or publication of confidential information the deletion or modification of records or could otherwise cause interruptions in our operations these risks are increased when we transmit information over the internet 

 

additionally as a provider of services to financial institutions and card processing services we are bound by the same limitations on disclosure of the information we receive from our customers as apply to the customers themselves if we fail to comply with these regulations and industry security requirements we could be exposed to suits for breach of contract governmental proceedings or prohibitions on card processing services in addition if more restrictive privacy laws rules or industry security requirements are adopted in the future on the federal or state level or by a specific industry body that could have an adverse impact on us through increased costs or restrictions 

on business processes any inability to prevent security or privacy breaches could cause our existing customers to lose confidence in our systems and terminate their agreements with us and could inhibit our ability to attract new customers andor adversely impact our relationship with administrative agencies 

 

misappropriation of our intellectual property and proprietary rights could impair our competitive position 

 

our ability to compete depends upon proprietary systems and technology despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our services or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary policing unauthorized use of our proprietary rights is difficult we cannot make any assurances that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of technology or that the agreements entered into for that purpose will be enforceable effective trademark service mark copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our applications and services are made available online misappropriation of our intellectual property or potential litigation concerning such matters could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 

 

if our applications or services are found to infringe the proprietary rights of others we may be required to change our business practices and may also become subject to significant costs and monetary penalties 

 

as our information technology applications and services develop we are increasingly subject to infringement claims any claims whether with or without merit could i be expensive and timeconsuming to defend ii cause us to cease making licensing or using applications that incorporate the challenged intellectual property iii require us to redesign our applications if feasible iv divert management’s attention and resources and v require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements in order to obtain the right to use necessary technologies 

 

we face liability to our merchant customers if checks that we have guaranteed are dishonored by the check writer’s bank 

 

if a check that we have guaranteed is dishonored by the check writer’s bank we must reimburse our merchant customer for the check’s face value and pursue collection of the amount from the check writer in some cases we recognize a liability to our merchant customers for estimated check returns and a receivable for amounts we estimate we will recover from the check writers based on historical experience and other relevant factors the estimated check returns and recovery amounts are subject to the risk that actual amounts returned may exceed our estimates and actual amounts recovered may be less than our estimates 

 

lack of system integrity fraudulent payments or credit quality related to funds settlement could result in a financial loss 

 

we settle funds on behalf of financial institutions other businesses and consumers and receive funds from clients card issuers payment networks and consumers on a daily basis for a variety of transaction types transactions facilitated by us include debit card credit card electronic bill payment transactions ach payments and check clearing that supports consumers financial institutions and other businesses these payment activities rely upon the technology infrastructure that facilitates the verification of activity with counterparties the facilitation of the payment as well as the detection or prevention of fraudulent payments if the continuity of operations integrity of processing or ability to detect or prevent fraudulent payments were compromised this could result in a financial loss to us in addition we may issue credit to consumers financial institutions or other businesses as part of the funds settlement a default on this credit by a counterparty could result in a financial loss to us 

 

our business is subject to the risks of international operations including movements in foreign currency exchange rates 

 

our international operations represent 21 of total 2009 revenues with approximately 16 or our total revenues conducted in currencies other than the us dollar as a result our financial condition and operating results could be significantly affected by risks associated with international activities including economic and labor conditions political instability tax laws including us taxes on foreign subsidiaries and changes in the value of 

the us dollar versus local currencies in addition we are less wellknown internationally than in the united states have less experience with local business conditions and will face challenges in successfully managing small operations located far from our headquarters because of the greater difficulty in overseeing and guiding operations from a distance 

 

as we expand our international operations more of our customers may pay us in foreign currencies conducting business in currencies other than us dollars subjects us to fluctuations in currency exchange rates our primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relate to foreign currencies in brazil europe australia and parts of asia the us dollar value of our net investments in foreign operations the periodic conversion of foreigndenominated earnings to the us dollar our reporting currency our results of operations and in some cases cash flows could be adversely affected in a material manner by movements in foreign currency exchange rates during the twelve months ended december 31 2009 approximately 16 of our revenues were denominated in currencies other than the us dollar including the brazilian real british pound and euro these risks could cause a material adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations 

 

if we are unable to successfully consummate and integrate acquisitions our results of operations may be adversely affected 

 

we have made numerous acquisitions in recent years as a part of our growth strategy we anticipate that we will continue to seek to acquire complementary businesses and services this strategy will depend on the ability to find suitable acquisitions and finance them on acceptable terms we may require additional debt or equity financing for future acquisitions and doing so may be made more difficult by our existing debt if we are unable to acquire suitable acquisition candidates we may experience slower growth further after successfully completing acquisitions we face challenges in integrating acquired businesses these challenges include eliminating redundant operations facilities and systems coordinating management and personnel retaining key employees managing different corporate cultures and achieving cost reductions and crossselling opportunities there can be no assurance that we will be able to fully integrate all aspects of acquired businesses successfully or fully realize the potential benefits of bringing them together and the process of integrating these acquisitions may disrupt our business and divert our resources 

 

failure to attract and retain skilled technical employees or senior management personnel could harm our ability to grow 

 

our future success depends upon our ability to attract and retain highlyskilled technical personnel because the development of our products and services requires knowledge of computer hardware operating system software system management software and application software our technical personnel must be proficient in a number of disciplines competition for such technical personnel is intense and our failure to hire and retain talented personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

 

our future growth will also require sales and marketing financial and administrative personnel to develop and support new products and services to enhance and support current products and services and to expand operational and financial systems there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain the necessary personnel to accomplish our growth strategies and we may experience constraints that could adversely affect our ability to satisfy client demand in a timely fashion 

 

our senior management team has significant experience in the financial services industry either at fis or with clients or competitors and the loss of this leadership could have an adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

 

risks related to business combinations 

 

we may fail to realize the anticipated cost savings and other financial benefits of the metavante merger on the anticipated schedule if at all 

 

to achieve planned financial benefits of the metavante merger fis will need to successfully integrate metavante’s operations into its own in a timely and efficient manner and will need to execute transitional matters 

successfully including integrating new members of management and the retention of key personnel there can be no assurance that fis will be able to accomplish this integration process smoothly or successfully in addition the integration of certain operations following the merger will require the dedication of significant management resources which will compete for management’s attention with its efforts to manage the daytoday business of the combined company any inability to realize the full extent of or any of the anticipated cost savings and financial benefits of the merger as well as any delays encountered in the integration process could have an adverse effect on the business and results of operations of the combined company 

 

if any part of the lps spinoff is determined to be a taxable transaction then additional taxes could be imposed on us and our shareholders 

 

on june 20 2008 we received a favorable private letter ruling from the internal revenue service “irs” regarding a series of transactions including the distribution of lps common stock to our shareholders which we refer to as the spinoff 

 

notwithstanding the favorable irs ruling that the spinoff qualified for taxfree treatment it would become taxable to us pursuant to section 355e of the code if 50 or more of the shares of either our common stock or lps common stock were acquired directly or indirectly as part of a plan or series of related transactions that included the spinoff if the irs were to determine that acquisitions of our common stock or of lps common stock either before or after the spinoff were part of a plan or series of related transactions that included the spinoff this determination could result in the recognition of substantial gain by us under section 355e 

 

although the taxes resulting from the spinoff not qualifying for taxfree treatment pursuant to section 355e for united states federal income tax purposes would be imposed on us under the tax disaffiliation agreement entered into by us and lps in connection with the spinoff lps would be required to indemnify us and our affiliates against all tax related liabilities caused by the failure of the spinoff to qualify for taxfree treatment for united states federal income tax purposes as a result of section 355e of the code to the extent these liabilities arise as a result of any action taken by lps or any of lps’ affiliates following the spinoff or otherwise result from any breach of any representation covenant or obligation of lps or any of lps’ affiliates under the tax disaffiliation agreement 

 

there is no guaranty that lps will have financial resources to satisfy any such indemnification obligation described above 

 

the executive chairman of our board of directors and other officers and directors have interests and positions that could present potential conflicts 

 

we and certain of our subsidiaries are parties to a variety of related party agreements and relationships with fnf and lps william p foley ii who is our executive chairman is currently the executive chairman of the board of directors of fnf lee a kennedy who served as president and chief executive officer of our company through september 30 2009 and who currently serves as executive vice chairman is also the executive chairman of the board of directors of lps in addition he serves as the chief executive officer of ceridian corporation a company in which fnf holds an approximate 33 equity interest brent b bickett and michael l gravelle who are executive officers of fis are also executive officers of fnf william p foley ii brent b bickett and michael l gravelle also own or hold substantial amounts of fnf stock and stock options thomas m hagerty and richard n massey who are both directors of fis are also directors of fnf david k hunt a director of fis is also a director of lps as a result of the foregoing there may be circumstances where certain of our executive officers and directors may be subject to conflicts of interest with respect to among other things i our ongoing relationships with fnf and lps including related party agreements and other arrangements with respect to the administration of tax matters employee benefits and indemnification ii the quality pricing and other terms associated with services that we provide to fnf and lps or that they provide to us under related party agreements iii business opportunities arising for either us fnf or lps that could be pursued by either us or by fnf or lps and iv conflicts of time with respect to matters potentially or actually involving or affecting fis 

 

we seek to manage these potential conflicts through abstention oversight by independent members of our board of directors and provisions in our agreements with fnf and lps however there can be no assurance that such measures will be effective or that we will be able to resolve all potential conflicts with fnf and lps or that the 

resolution of any such conflicts will be no less favorable to us than if we were dealing with an unaffiliated third party 

 

we have substantial investments in recorded goodwill and other intangible assets as a result of prior acquisitions and a severe or extended economic downturn could cause these investments to become impaired requiring writedowns that would reduce our operating income 

 

as of december 31 2009 goodwill aggregated to 82329 million 588 of total assets and other indefinite lived intangible assets aggregated to 491 million 04 of total assets current accounting rules require goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets to be assessed for impairment at least annually or whenever changes in circumstances indicate potential impairment factors that may be considered a change in circumstance include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results a significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization and negative industry or economic trends the results of our fiscal year 2009 annual assessment of the recoverability of goodwill indicated that the fair values of the company’s reporting units were in excess of the carrying values of those reporting units and thus no goodwill impairment existed as of december 31 2009 additionally other than impairment charges of 1240 million relating to trademarks associated primarily with the rebranding of fis the fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets was in excess of the carrying value of those assets however if worldwide or united states economic conditions decline significantly with negative impacts to bank spending and consumer behavior the carrying amount of our goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets may no longer be recoverable and we may be required to record an impairment charge which would have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition we will continue to monitor the fair value of our other indefinite lived intangible assets as well as our market capitalization and the impact of any economic downturn on our business to determine if there is an impairment in future periods

this section should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes of fis included elsewhere in this annual report this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forwardlooking statements see “forwardlooking statements” and “risk factors” for a discussion of the uncertainties risks and assumptions associated with these forwardlooking statements that could cause future results to differ materially from those reflected in this section 

 

overview 

 

fis is a leading global provider of banking and payments technology solutions processing services and informationbased services we offer financial institution core processing card issuer and transaction processing services including the nyce network fis is a member of standard and poor’s sp 500 ® index and consistently holds a leading ranking in the annual fintech 100 rankings as of december 31 2009 fis has more than 300 solutions serving over 14000 financial institutions and business customers in over 100 countries spanning all segments of the financial services industry we have four reporting segments fsg psg isg and corporate and 

other a description of these segments is included above in item 1 revenues by segment and the results of operations of our segments are discussed below in segment results of operations 

 

business trends and conditions 

 

approximately 85 of our revenue is derived from multiyear agreements and is considered recurring which provides relative stability to our revenue stream however the condition of the overall economy can affect our revenue growth in a number of areas a significant portion of our revenue is derived from transaction processing fees as a result lower deposit and card transactions associated with reduced consumer and commercial activity will adversely impact revenue in addition sales of software licenses and professional services which represent approximately 15 of our revenue can be regarded as discretionary spending by our customers and may contract when their capital budgets tighten in light of the challenging revenue environment we are seeking to manage our costs and capital expenditures prudently before consideration of the metavante acquisition we reduced both domestic headcount and capital expenditures in 2009 from 2008 levels 

 

we completed the metavante merger on october 1 2009 the combined company is positioned to provide a comprehensive range of integrated solutions to its customers and has greater geographic reach than any other provider in the industry which will enhance service to the combined company’s customers management expects to realize cost and revenue synergies over the next twentyfour months 

 

as the payment market continues to evolve from paperbased to electronic we continue to add new services responsive to this trend card transactions continue to increase as a percentage of total pointofsale payments which fuels continuing demand for cardrelated services in recent years we have added a variety of storedvalue card types internet banking and electronic bill presentmentpayment services as well as a number of card enhancement and loyaltyreward programs the common goal of these offerings continues to be convenience and security for the consumer coupled with value to the financial institution the evolution to electronic transactions also intensifies the vulnerability to fraud increasing the demand for our risk management solutions at the same time the use of checks continues to decline as a percentage of total pointofsale payments which negatively impacts our check warranty and itemprocessing businesses 

 

we compete for both licensing and outsourcing business and thus are affected by the decisions of financial institutions to utilize our services under an outsourced arrangement or to process inhouse under a software license and maintenance agreement as a provider of outsourcing solutions we benefit from multiyear recurring revenue streams which help moderate the effects of year to year economic changes on our results of operations one of the current trends we expect to benefit from in the financial services industry is the migration to an outsourced model to improve profitability 

 

consolidation within the banking industry may be beneficial or detrimental to our businesses when consolidations occur merger partners often operate disparate systems licensed from competing service providers the newly formed entity generally makes a determination to migrate its core and payments systems to a single platform when a financial institution processing client is involved in a consolidation we may benefit by expanding the use of our services if such services are chosen to survive the consolidation and support the newly combined entity conversely we may lose market share if a customer of ours is involved in a consolidation and our services are not chosen to survive the consolidation and support the newly combined entity we seek to mitigate the risks of consolidations by offering other competitive services to take advantage of specific opportunities at the surviving company 

 

we believe that we are in the midst of one of the most difficult times that has ever existed for financial institutions retailers and other businesses in the united states and internationally we expect a continuation of bank failures in the next few years which may be offset to a degree by somewhat decreased bank acquisition activity which traditionally occurs in the banking sector to date bank failures and forced government actions that have occurred have not been significant to our revenues however continuing or escalating bank failures and forced government actions could negatively impact our business this exposure may be mitigated by incremental revenues we may generate from license fees or services associated with assisting surviving institutions with integrating acquired assets resulting from financial failures 

while we believe that we are well positioned to withstand the current financial crisis there are factors outside our control that might impact our operating results that we may not be able to fully anticipate as to timing and severity including but not limited to adverse effects if banks are nationalized or if global economic conditions worsen causing further slowdowns in consumer spending and lending further there could be an impact on our ability to access capital should any of our lenders fail 

 

for an update on our brazil card processing venture see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements 

 

critical accounting policies 

 

the accounting policies described below are those we consider critical in preparing our consolidated financial statements these policies require management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures with respect to contingent liabilities and assets at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods actual amounts could differ from those estimates see note 3 of notes to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed description of the significant accounting policies that have been followed in preparing our consolidated financial statements 

 

revenue recognition 

 

the company generates revenues from the delivery of bank processing credit and debit card processing services other payment processing services professional services software licensing and software related services and products revenues are recognized when evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred fees are fixed or determinable and collection is considered probable we are frequently a party to multiple concurrent contracts with the same customer these situations require judgment to determine whether the individual contracts should be aggregated or evaluated separately for purposes of revenue recognition in making this determination we consider the timing of negotiating and executing the contracts whether the different elements of the contracts are interdependent and whether any of the payment terms of the contracts are interrelated due to the large number broad nature and average size of individual contracts we are party to the impact of judgments and assumptions that we apply in recognizing revenue for any single contract is not likely to have a material effect on our consolidated operations or financial position however the broader accounting policy assumptions that we apply across similar arrangements or classes of customers could significantly influence the timing and amount of revenue recognized in our historical and future results of operations or financial position additional information about our revenue recognition policies is included in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements 

 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

 

the company analyzes trade accounts receivable by considering historical bad debts customer creditworthiness current economic trends changes in customer payment terms and collection trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts any change in the assumptions used may result in an additional allowance for doubtful accounts being recognized in the period in which the change occurs the allowance for doubtful accounts was 418 million and 406 million at december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively 

 

reserves for check guarantee losses 

 

in our check guarantee business if a guaranteed check presented to a merchant customer is dishonored by the check writer’s bank we reimburse our merchant customer for the check’s face value and pursue collection of the amount from the delinquent check writer loss reserves and anticipated recoveries are primarily determined by performing a historical analysis of our check loss and recovery experience and considering other factors that could affect that experience in the future such factors include the general economy the overall industry mix of our customer volumes statistical analysis of check fraud trends within our customer volumes and the quality of returned checks once these factors are considered we establish a rate for check losses that is calculated by dividing the expected check losses by dollar volume processed and a rate for anticipated recoveries that is calculated by dividing the anticipated recoveries by the total amount of related check losses these rates are then applied against the dollar volume processed and check losses respectively each month and charged to costs of revenues the estimated check returns and recovery amounts are subject to risk that actual amounts returned and recovered may be different than our estimates 

historically such estimation processes have proven to be materially accurate however our projections of probable check guarantee losses and anticipated recoveries are inherently uncertain and as a result we cannot predict with certainty the amount of such items changes in economic conditions the risk characteristics and composition of our customers and other factors could impact our actual and projected amounts we recorded check guarantee losses net of anticipated recoveries excluding service fees of 833 million and 1152 million respectively for the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 a ten percent difference in our estimated check guarantee loss reserve net of estimated recoveries as of december 31 2009 could impact 2009 net earnings by less than 20 million aftertax 

 

computer software 

 

computer software includes the fair value of software acquired in business combinations purchased software and capitalized software development costs as of december 31 2009 and 2008 computer software net of accumulated amortization was 9327 million and 6170 million respectively purchased software is recorded at cost and amortized using the straight line method over its estimated useful life and software acquired in business combinations is recorded at its fair value and amortized using straight line and accelerated methods over its estimated useful life ranging from 3 to 10 years in determining useful lives management considers historical results and technological trends which may influence the estimate amortization expense for computer software was 1498 million 1499 million and 1643 million in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively included in discontinued operations in the consolidated statement of earnings was amortization expense on computer software of 148 million and 325 million for 2008 and 2007 respectively we also assess the recorded value of computer software for impairment on a regular basis by comparing the carrying value to the estimated future cash flows to be generated by the underlying software asset there are inherent uncertainties in determining the expected useful life or cash flows to be generated from computer software while we have not historically experienced significant changes in these estimates we could be subject to such changes in the future 

 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

 

we are required to allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction at their estimated fair values the estimates used to determine the fair value of longlived assets such as intangible assets are complex and require a significant amount of management judgment we generally engage independent valuation specialists to assist us in making fair value determinations we are also required to estimate the useful lives of intangible assets to determine the amount of acquisitionrelated intangible asset amortization expense to record in future periods we periodically review the estimated useful lives assigned to our definitelived intangible assets to determine whether such estimated useful lives continue to be appropriate additionally we review our indefinite lived intangible assets to determine if there is any change in circumstances that may indicate the asset’s useful life is no longer indefinite 

 

we review the carrying value of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable the authoritative guidance requires us to perform a twostep impairment test on goodwill first we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value we determine the fair value of our reporting units based on the present value of estimated future cash flows if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the unit’s net assets goodwill is not impaired and further testing is not required if the carrying value of the reporting unit’s net assets exceeds the fair value of the unit then we perform the second step of the impairment test to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill and any impairment charge additionally we estimate the fair value of acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives and compare this amount to the underlying carrying value 

 

determining the fair value of a reporting unit or acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives involves judgment and the use of significant estimates and assumptions which include assumptions regarding the revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate estimated future cash flows riskadjusted discount rates and future economic and market conditions and other assumptions 

 

for the year ended december 31 2009 our analysis of indefinite lived intangible assets did indicate an impairment of certain trademarks which are being discontinued as a result of the company’s rebranding campaign 

initiated on october 1 2009 following the acquisition of metavante accordingly we recorded a pretax charge of 1240 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 during the year ended december 31 2008 we recorded a pretax impairment charge of 520 million to reduce the carrying value of a trademark related to our retail check business to its estimated fair value and included approximately 260 million of this charge in discontinued operations given the significance of our goodwill and intangible asset balances an adverse change in fair value could result in an impairment charge which could be material to our financial statements 

 

accounting for income taxes 

 

as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements we are required to determine income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate this process involves estimating actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing recognition of items for income tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred income tax assets and liabilities which are included within the consolidated balance sheets we must then assess the likelihood that deferred income tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely establish a valuation allowance to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period we must reflect this increase as an expense within income tax expense in the statement of earnings determination of the income tax expense requires estimates and can involve complex issues that may require an extended period to resolve further changes in the geographic mix of revenues or in the estimated level of annual pretax income can cause the overall effective income tax rate to vary from period to period we believe that our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that we adequately provide for any known tax contingencies we believe the estimates and assumptions used to support our evaluation of tax benefit realization are reasonable however final determination of prioryear tax liabilities either by settlement with tax authorities or expiration of statutes of limitations could be materially different than estimates reflected in assets and liabilities and historical income tax provisions the outcome of these final determinations could have a material effect on our income tax provision net income or cash flows in the period that determination is made

selling general and administrative expenses 

 

selling general and administrative expenses totaled 5541 million 3886 million and 3025 million for 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively the increase of 1655 million in 2009 as compared to 2008 was primarily due to a restructuring integration and merger related charges including professional and advisory fees severance incentive bonuses and lease adjustments contributing 1085 million of the yearoveryear increase and b incremental costs associated with the metavante acquisition stockbased compensation increased from 516 million in 2008 to 710 million in 2009 stockbased compensation in the 2009 period included vesting acceleration charges of 292 million due to change in control provisions triggered by the metavante acquisition and 45 million for new merger related grants by comparison the 2008 period included charges of 141 million for the accelerated vesting of all stock awards held by efunds employees assumed in the efunds acquisition and 26 million relating to the acceleration upon termination of certain unvested executive stock awards the increase of 861 million in 2008 as 

compared to 2007 primarily relates to the incremental costs from the efunds acquisition as well as increased stock compensation costs additional restructuring and integration charges and charges associated with the lps spinoff stockbased compensation increased from 249 million in 2007 to 516 million in 2008 the 267 million increase in stockbased compensation is mainly attributable to the 2008 acceleration charges noted above the remaining increase is attributable to 210 million of additional restructuring and integration charges and 93 million in charges associated with the spinoff of lps as compared to 60 million and 05 million of such charges respectively in 2007 

 

impairment charges 

 

impairment charges totaled 1369 million 260 million and 135 million for 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively the 2009 charges relate primarily to the introduction of a new brand identity in conjunction with the metavante merger giving rise to the impairment of a number of previously acquired trademarks the 2009 period also included charges related to impairment of certain capitalized software assets totaling approximately 129 million the 2008 period included charges of 260 million to reduce the carrying value of a trademark related to our retail check business to its estimated fair value the 2007 period included impairment charges of 135 million to writeoff impaired software assets

financing 

 

on january 18 2007 we entered into a fiveyear syndicated unsecured credit agreement the “fis credit agreement” the fis credit agreement provides total committed capital of 30000 million comprised of 21000 million of term notes the “term loan a” and 9000 million of revolving capacity the “revolving loan” the revolving loan is bifurcated into two tranches a 1650 million tranche that allows borrowings in us dollars only and a 7350 million multicurrency tranche that allows borrowings in us dollars euros british pounds sterling and australian dollars the multicurrency tranche of the revolving loan includes a sublimit of 2500 million for swing line loans and a 2500 million sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit in addition the fis credit agreement originally provided for an uncommitted incremental loan facility in the maximum principal amount of 6000 million 

 

to facilitate our acquisition of efunds on july 30 2007 we executed an amendment to the fis credit agreement to increase the permitted maximum principal of uncommitted incremental loans from 6000 million to 21000 million and converted the facility from unsecured to secured on september 12 2007 the amendment became effective and we entered into a joinder agreement to obtain 16000 million of term loans the “term loan b” on july 2 2008 in conjunction with the spinoff of lender processing services inc 15850 million the then outstanding principal balance of term loan b was retired 

 

on november 1 2007 metavante entered into a credit agreement the “mv credit agreement” for an aggregate principal amount of 20000 million comprised of 17500 million of sevenyear term loans the “mv term loan” and a sixyear revolving capacity of 2500 million the “mv revolving loan” immediately preceding the merger of fis and metavante the outstanding balances of the mv term loan and mv revolving loan were 17238 million and 0 respectively 

 

on october 1 2009 contemporaneous with the closing of the metavante merger fis obtained 5000 million of term loans the “term loan c” utilizing the 5000 million of remaining uncommitted incremental loans under the september 12 2007 amendment of the fis credit agreement fis exchanged the 5000 million of term loan c for 5000 million of the mv term loan which portion was subsequently cancelled in addition on october 1 2009 fis purchased 4238 million of the remaining mv term loan which loans were deemed to be contemporaneously cancelled after giving effect to the exchange purchase and cancellation the aggregate principal amount of the mv term loan outstanding as of october 1 2009 was 8000 million 

 

also on october 1 2009 fis entered into an agreement to sell certain of its accounts receivable the “ar facility” to a whollyowned special purpose accounts receivable and financing entity the “spv” which is exclusively engaged in purchasing receivables from fis the spv funds its purchases in part by selling interests in the accounts receivables to a syndicate of financial institution purchasers in exchange for up to 1450 million in capital funding provided however that if fis obtains additional commitments from new or existing purchasers the aggregate amount may be increased by up to an additional 550 million to an overall aggregate capital amount of 2000 million the sales to the purchasers do not qualify for sale treatment as we maintain effective control over the receivables that are sold thus the spv is included in our consolidated financial statements at december 31 2009 there was no outstanding capital under the accounts receivable facility 

we may borrow repay and reborrow amounts under the revolving loan from time to time until the maturity of the revolving loan we must make quarterly principal payments under the term loan a of 525 million per quarter from march 31 2010 through september 30 2011 with the remaining balance of 15225 million payable on january 18 2012 as of december 31 2009 there are no longer any mandatory quarterly principal payments on the term loan c as these requirements have been fulfilled in full due to principal prepayments made during the quarter ended december 31 2009 the remaining principal balance of the term loan c is payable on january 18 2012 we must make quarterly principal payments on the mv term loan in the amount of 20 million on the first business day of each february may august and november with the balance of 7594 million payable on november 1 2014 

 

the following table summarizes the mandatory annual principal payments on the fis credit agreement and mv credit agreement as of december 31 2009 in millions 

 

 

 

the fis credit agreement mv credit agreement and ar facility are subject to customary affirmative negative and financial covenants including among other things limits on the creation of liens limits on the incurrence of indebtedness restrictions on investments and dispositions limitations on dividends and other restricted payments a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum leverage ratio we were in compliance with all covenants related to the credit facilities at december 31 2009 

 

as of december 31 2009 one financial institution that was a lender under one of our credit facilities had failed thereby reducing the amount of revolving capacity available to us under our revolving loan by an immaterial amount no other financial institutions that are lenders under any of our credit facilities have failed to date we continue to monitor the financial stability of our counterparties on an ongoing basis the lender commitments under the undrawn portions of the revolving loan and ar facility are comprised of a diversified set of financial institutions both domestic and international the combined commitments of our top 10 lenders comprise about 67 of our revolving loan and ar facility the failure of any single lender to perform their obligations under the revolving loan andor the ar facility would not adversely impact our ability to fund operations if the single largest lender were to simultaneously default under the terms of both the fis credit agreement impacting the capacity of the revolving loan and the ar facility the maximum loss of available capacity on the undrawn portion of these agreements would be about 1176 million as of december 31 2009 the combined undrawn capacity of the revolving loan and the ar facility was 7034 million 

 

as of december 31 2009 we have entered into interest rate swap transactions converting a portion of the interest rate exposure on our term and revolving loans from variable to fixed see item 7a 

 

private placement investment 

 

on october 1 2009 pursuant to an investment agreement with thomas h lee partners lp “thl” and fnf dated as of march 31 2009 fis issued and sold a to thl in a private placement 129 million shares of fis common stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately 2000 million and b to fnf in a private placement 32 million shares of fis common stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately 500 million fis paid each of thl and fnf a transaction fee equal to 3 of their respective investments the investment agreement provides that neither thl nor fnf may transfer the shares purchased in the investments subject to limited exceptions for 180 days after the closing

recent accounting pronouncements 

 

in december 2007 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued new guidance requiring an acquirer in a business combination to recognize the assets acquired the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at their fair values at the acquisition date with limited exceptions the costs of the acquisition and any related restructuring costs are to be recognized separately when the fair value of assets acquired exceeds the fair value of consideration transferred plus any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree the excess will be recognized as a gain all business combinations will be accounted for prospectively by applying the acquisition method including combinations among mutual entities and combinations by contract alone in april 2009 the fasb amended and clarified the initial recognition and measurement subsequent measurement and accounting and related disclosures arising from contingencies in a business combination assets and liabilities arising from contingencies in a business combination are to be recognized at their fair value on the acquisition date if fair value can be determined during the measurement period if fair value cannot be determined the existing guidance for contingencies and other authoritative literature should be followed this new guidance is effective for periods beginning on or after december 15 2008 and applies to business combinations occurring after the effective date the company has applied the provisions to the metavante combination and will apply the provisions prospectively for any future business combinations 

 

in december 2007 the fasb issued new guidance relative to noncontrolling interests sometimes called minority interests requiring 1 that noncontrolling interests be presented as a component of equity on the balance sheet 2 that the amount of net earnings attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interests be clearly identified and presented on the face of the consolidated statement of earnings and 3 expanded disclosures that identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent’s owners and the interests of the noncontrolling owners of subsidiaries the company adopted the presentation and disclosure requirements as of january 1 2009 with retrospective application for all periods presented 

 

in june 2009 the fasb issued new guidance for transfers and servicing of financial assets the primary changes include 1 the elimination of the “qualified special purpose entity” concept and the exception that allowed many transferors to deconsolidate such entities 2 a new “participating interest” definition that must be met for transfers of portions of financial assets to be eligible for sale accounting 3 clarification and amendments 

to the derecognition criteria for a transfer to be accounted for as a sale 4 a change to the amount of recognized gainloss on a transfer accounted for as a sale when beneficial interests are received by the transferor and 5 enhanced disclosure requirements this new guidance will be applied prospectively to new transfers of financial assets occurring in fiscal years beginning after november 15 2009 

 

in june 2009 the fasb issued new consolidation guidance for variable interest entities vie’s it requires an enterprise to qualitatively assess the determination of the primary beneficiary or consolidator of a vie based on whether the entity 1 has the power to direct matters that most significantly impact the activities of the vie and 2 has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie the new guidance changes the consideration of kickout rights in determining if an entity is a vie which may cause certain additional entities to be considered vie’s it also requires an ongoing reconsideration of the primary beneficiary and amends the events that trigger a reassessment of whether an entity is a vie the new guidance is effective january 1 2010 for calendar yearend companies there is no grandfathering of previous consolidation conclusions as a result any existing vie’s at date of adoption must be reevaluated the company currently has no unconsolidated vie’s thus this new guidance is not expected to have an impact on the company’s financial position or results of operations 

 

in august 2009 the fasb issued guidance to amend accounting standards codification asc topic 820 fair value measurements the update addresses practice difficulties caused by the tension between fairvalue measurements based on the price that would be paid to transfer a liability to a new obligor and contractual or legal requirements that prevent such transfers from taking place the guidance prescribes using the quoted price in an active market for an identical liability when traded as an asset to assign a fair value to debt the new guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after august 27 2009 and applies to all required fairvalue measurements of liabilities no new fairvalue measurements are required by the standard the company’s methodology for assessing and reporting the fair value of outstanding debt is consistent with that prescribed by this guidance 

 

in september 2009 the fasb amended asc subtopic 60525 revenue recognition — multipleelement arrangements to eliminate the requirement that all undelivered elements have vendor specific objective evidence vsoe or thirdparty evidence tpe of standalone selling price before an entity can recognize the portion of an overall arrangement fee that is attributable to items that have been delivered in the absence of vsoe or tpe of the standalone selling price for one or more delivered or undelivered elements in a multipleelement arrangement entities will be required to estimate the selling prices of those elements the overall arrangement fee will be allocated to each element both delivered and undelivered items based on their relative selling prices regardless of whether those selling prices are evidenced by vsoe or tpe or are based on the entity’s estimated selling price application of the “residual method” of allocating an overall arrangement fee between delivered and undelivered elements will no longer be permitted upon adoption of this new guidance additional disclosure will be required about multipleelement revenue arrangements as well as qualitative and quantitative disclosure about the effect of the change the amendment is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june 15 2010 early adoption is permitted at the beginning of a fiscal year or applied retrospectively to the beginning of a fiscal year the company adopted this guidance prospectively as of january 1 2010 the effect of the change for fis will be a function of the new contracts entered into or materially modified after adoption and relates primarily to arrangements that include software licenses with other service elements management expects this guidance to result in a modest increase in revenue in the year of adoption related to revenue that would have been deferred under the existing authoritative literature

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risks tableend  

market risk 

 

we are exposed to market risks primarily from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates we use certain derivative financial instruments including interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk we do not use derivatives for trading purposes to generate income or to engage in speculative activity 

interest rate risk 

 

at the present time our only material market risksensitive instruments are our debt and related interest rate swaps we have issued debt that bears interest at floating rates we use interest rate swaps for the purpose of managing our interest expense on the mix of fixed and floating rate debt we manage interest rate sensitivity by measuring potential increases in interest expense that would result from a probable change in interest rates when the potential increase in interest expense exceeds an acceptable amount we reduce risk through the purchase of derivatives 

 

as of december 31 2009 we are paying interest on our term loan a at libor plus 088 on our metavante term loan at libor plus 325 on our term loan c at libor plus 425 and on our revolving loan at libor plus 070 an increase of 100 basis points in the libor rate would increase our annual debt service under the fis credit agreement after we calculate the impact of our interest rate swaps by 70 million based on principal amounts outstanding at december 31 2009 we performed the foregoing sensitivity analysis based on the principal amount of our floating rate debt as of december 31 2009 less the principal amount of such debt that was then subject to an interest rate swap converting such debt into fixed rate debt this sensitivity analysis is based solely on the principal amount of such debt as of december 31 2009 and does not take into account any changes that occurred in the prior 12 months or that may take place in the next 12 months in the amount of our outstanding debt or in the notional amount of outstanding interest rate swaps in respect of our debt further in this sensitivity analysis the change in interest rates is assumed to be applicable for an entire year for comparison purposes based on principal amounts on the revolving loan and term loan a outstanding as of december 31 2008 and calculated in the same manner as set forth above an increase of 100 basis points in the libor rate would have increased our annual interest expense after we calculate the impact of our interest rate swaps by 39 million 

 

as of december 31 2009 we have entered into the following interest rate swap transactions converting a portion of the interest rate exposure on our term and revolving loans from variable to fixed in millions 

 

 

 

 

  

we have designated these interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges a portion of the amount included in accumulated other comprehensive earnings is reclassified into interest expense as a yield adjustment as interest payments are made on the term and revolving loans in accordance with the authoritative guidance for fair value 

measurements the inputs used to determine the estimated fair value of our interest rate swaps are level 2type measurements we considered our own credit risk and the credit risk of the counterparties when determining the fair value of our interest rate swaps 

 

foreign currency risk 

 

our exposure to foreign currency exchange risks arises from our nonus operations generally to the extent they are conducted in local currency changes in foreign currency exchange rates affect translations of revenues denominated in currencies other than us dollars our international operations generated approximately 7827 million in revenues during the year ended december 31 2009 of which approximately 6051 million was denominated in currencies other than the us dollar the major currencies that we are exposed to are the brazilian real the euro and the british pound sterling a 10 move in average exchange rates for these currencies assuming a simultaneous and immediate 10 change in all of such rates for the relevant period would have had the following effects on our reported revenues for the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 in millions 

 

 

 

the impact on earnings of the foregoing assumed 10 change in each of the periods presented would not have been significant 

 

our foreign exchange risk management policy permits the use of derivative instruments such as forward contracts and options to reduce volatility in our results of operations andor cash flows resulting from foreign exchange rate fluctuations our international operations’ revenues and expenses are generally denominated in local currency which limits the economic exposure to foreign exchange risk in those jurisdictions we do not enter into foreign currency derivative instruments for trading purposes

as part of our research and development process we evaluate current and emerging technology for compatibility with our existing and future software platforms to this end we engage with various hardware and software vendors in evaluation of various infrastructure components where appropriate we use thirdparty technology components in the development of our software applications and service offerings thirdparty software may be used for highly specialized business functions which we may not be able to develop internally within time and budget constraints additionally thirdparty software may be used for commodity type functions within a technology platform environment in the case of nearly all of our thirdparty software enterprise license agreements exist for the thirdparty component and either alternative suppliers exist or transfer rights exist to ensure the continuity of supply as a result we are not materially dependent upon any thirdparty technology components we work with our customers to determine the appropriate timing and approach to introducing technology or infrastructure changes to our applications and services in the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 we recorded expense of approximately 848 million 704 million and 709 million respectively on research and development efforts excluding amounts capitalized 

government regulation 

our products and services are subject to a broad range of complex federal state and foreign regulation including federal truthinlending and truthinsavings rules regulation aa unfair or deceptive acts or practices privacy laws usury laws the equal credit opportunity act the electronic funds transfer act the fair credit reporting act the fair debt collection practices act the bank secrecy act the usa patriot act the internal revenue code the employee retirement income security act the health insurance portability and accountability act and the community reinvestment act the compliance of our products and services with these and other applicable laws and regulations depends on a variety of factors including the manner in which our clients use them our clients are contractually responsible for determining what is required of them under applicable laws and regulations so that we can assist them in their compliance efforts the failure of our products and services to comply with applicable laws and regulations could result in restrictions on our ability to provide them as well as the imposition of civil fines andor criminal penalties the four principal areas of regulation impacting our business are 

 

 

as a provider of electronic data processing and backoffice services to financial institutions we are also subject to regulatory oversight and examination by the federal financial institutions examination council an interagency body of the federal deposit insurance corporation the office of thrift supervision the office of the comptroller of the currency the board of governors of the federal reserve system the national credit union administration and various state regulatory authorities in addition independent auditors annually review several of our operations to provide reports on internal controls for our customers’ auditors and regulators we are also subject to review by state and foreign laws and rules that regulate many of the same activities that are described above including electronic data processing and backoffice services for financial institutions and use of consumer information 

the foregoing list of laws and regulations to which our company is subject is not exhaustive and the regulatory framework governing our operations changes continuously although we do not believe that compliance with future laws and regulations related to our businesses will have a material adverse effect on our company enactment of new laws and regulations may increasingly affect the operations of our business directly and indirectly which could result in substantial regulatory compliance costs litigation expense adverse publicity andor loss of revenue

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the normal risks of business we are subject to significant risks and uncertainties including those listed below and others described elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k any of the risks described herein could result in a significant adverse effect on our results of operation and financial condition 

if we fail to adapt our services to changes in technology or in the marketplace or if our ongoing efforts to upgrade our technology are not successful we could lose customers and have difficulty attracting new customers for our services 

the markets for our services are characterized by constant technological changes frequent introductions of new services and evolving industry standards our future success will be significantly affected by our ability to enhance our current services and develop and introduce new services that address the increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers and their clients these 

initiatives carry the risks associated with any new service development effort including cost overruns delays in delivery and performance issues there can be no assurance that we will be successful in developing marketing and selling new services that meet these changing demands that we will not experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development introduction and marketing of these services or that our new services and their enhancements will adequately meet the demands of the marketplace and achieve market acceptance 

we may experience defects development delays installation difficulties and system failures with respect to our technology solutions which would harm our business and reputation and expose us to potential liability 

many of our services are based on sophisticated software and computing systems and we may encounter delays when developing new technology solutions and services further the technology solutions underlying our services have occasionally contained and may in the future contain undetected errors or defects when first introduced or when new versions are released in addition we may experience difficulties in installing or integrating our technologies on platforms used by our customers finally our systems and operations could be exposed to damage or interruption from fire natural disaster power loss telecommunications failure unauthorized entry and computer viruses defects in our technology solutions errors or delays in the processing of electronic transactions or other difficulties could result in i interruption of business operations ii delay in market acceptance iii additional development and remediation costs iv diversion of technical and other resources v loss of customers and vi negative publicity or exposure to liability claims 

any one or more of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations although we attempt to limit our potential liability through disclaimers and limitationofliability provisions in our license and customer agreements we cannot be certain that these measures will always be successful in limiting our liability 

we operate in a competitive business environment and if we are unable to compete effectively our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 

the market for our services is intensely competitive our competitors vary in size and in the scope and breadth of the services they offer some of our competitors have substantial resources we face direct competition from third parties and since many of our larger potential customers have historically developed their key applications inhouse and therefore view their system requirements from a makeversusbuy perspective we often compete against our potential customers’ inhouse capacities in addition we expect that the markets in which we compete will continue to attract new competitors and new technologies there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors or that competitive pressures we face in the markets in which we operate will not materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our revenues from the sale of services to members of visa mastercard american express and other similar organizations are dependent upon our continued certification and sponsorship and the loss or suspension of certification or sponsorship could adversely affect our business 

in order to provide our card processing services we must be certified by visa mastercard american express and other similar organizations these certifications are dependent upon our continued adherence to the standards of the issuing bodies the member financial institutions some of which are our competitors set the standards with which we must comply if we fail to comply with these standards our certifications could be suspended or terminated the termination of our certifications or any changes in the rules and regulations governing visa mastercard american express or other similar organizations could prevent our registration or otherwise limit our ability to provide services which could result in a reduction in revenue or increased costs of operation which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business 

potential customers may be reluctant to switch to a new vendor which may adversely affect our growth both in the us and internationally 

for banks and other potential customers of our financial information software and services switching from one vendor of bank core processing or related software and services or from an internallydeveloped system to a new vendor is a significant undertaking many potential customers worry about potential disadvantages such as loss of accustomed functionality increased costs and business disruption as a result potential customers both in the us and internationally often resist change we seek to overcome this resistance through strategies such as making investments to enhance the functionality of our software however there can be no assurance that our strategies for overcoming potential customers’ reluctance to change vendors will be successful and this resistance may adversely affect our growth both in the us and internationally 

demand for many of our services is sensitive to the level of consumer transactions generated by our customers and accordingly our revenues could be impacted negatively by the current recession or any other event causing a material slowing of consumer spending 

a significant portion of our revenue is derived from transaction processing fees any changes in economic factors such as the current recession that adversely affect consumer spending and related consumer debt or lead to a reduction in check writing or credit and debit card usage could reduce the volume of transactions that we process and have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we have a long sales cycle for many of our applications and if we fail to close sales after expending significant time and resources to do so our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 

the implementation of many of our applications often involves significant capital commitments by our customers particularly those with smaller operational scale potential customers generally commit significant resources to an evaluation of available software and require us to expend substantial time effort and money educating them as to the value of our software and services we incur substantial costs in order to obtain each new customer we may expend significant funds and management resources during the sales cycle and ultimately fail to close the sale our sales cycle may be extended due to our customers’ budgetary constraints or for other reasons if we are unsuccessful in closing sales after expending significant funds and management resources or we experience delays it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

many of our customers are subject to a regulatory environment and to industry standards that may change in a manner that reduces the number of transactions in which our customers engage and therefore reduces our revenues 

our customers are subject to a number of government regulations and industry standards with which our services must comply for example our services are affected by visa mastercard american express and electronic payment standards that are generally updated twice annually in addition action by regulatory authorities relating to credit availability data usage privacy or other related regulatory developments could have an adverse effect on our customers and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

security breaches or our own failure to comply with privacy regulations imposed on providers of services to financial institutions could harm our business by disrupting our delivery of services and damaging our reputation 

as part of our business we electronically receive process store and transmit sensitive business information of our customers in addition we collect personal consumer data such as names and addresses social security numbers driver’s license numbers and payment history records unauthorized access to our computer systems or databases could result in the theft or publication of confidential information or the deletion or modification of records or could otherwise cause interruptions in our operations these concerns about security are increased when we transmit information over the internet 

additionally as a provider of services to financial institutions we are bound by the same limitations on disclosure of the information we receive from our customers as apply to the financial institutions themselves if we fail to comply with these regulations we could be exposed to suits for breach of contract or to governmental proceedings in addition if more restrictive privacy laws or rules are adopted in the future on the federal or state level that could have an adverse impact on us any inability to prevent security or privacy breaches could cause our existing customers to lose confidence in our systems and terminate their agreements with us and could inhibit our ability to attract new customers andor adversely impact our relationship with administrative agencies 

misappropriation of our intellectual property and proprietary rights could impair our competitive position 

our ability to compete depends upon proprietary systems and technology despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our services or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary policing unauthorized use of our proprietary rights is difficult we cannot make any assurances that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of technology or that the agreements entered into for that purpose will be enforceable effective trademark service mark copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our applications and services are made available online misappropriation of our intellectual property or potential litigation concerning such matters could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 

we face liability to our merchant customers if checks that we have guaranteed are dishonored by the check writer’s bank 

if a check that we have guaranteed is dishonored by the check writer’s bank we must reimburse our merchant customer for the check’s face value and pursue collection of the amount from the check writer in some cases we recognize a liability to our merchant customers for estimated check returns and a receivable for amounts we estimate we will recover from the check writers based on historical experience and other relevant factors the estimated check returns and recovery amounts are subject to the risk that actual amounts returned may exceed our estimates and actual amounts recovered may be less than our estimates 

if our applications or services are found to infringe the proprietary rights of others we may be required to change our business practices and may also become subject to significant costs and monetary penalties 

as our information technology applications and services develop we may become increasingly subject to infringement claims any claims whether with or without merit could i be expensive and timeconsuming to defend ii cause us to cease making licensing or using applications that incorporate the challenged intellectual property iii require us to redesign our applications if feasible iv divert management’s attention and resources and v require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements in order to obtain the right to use necessary technologies 

our business is subject to the risks of international operations including movements in foreign currency exchange rates 

we derive a significant portion of our revenue and earnings from international operations as a result our financial condition and operating results could be significantly affected by risks associated with international activities including economic and labor conditions political instability tax laws including us taxes on foreign subsidiaries and changes in the value of the us dollar versus local currencies in addition we are less wellknown internationally than in the united states have less experience with local business conditions and will face challenges in successfully managing small operations located far from our headquarters because of the greater difficulty in overseeing and guiding operations from a distance 

as we expand our international operations more of our customers may pay us in foreign currencies conducting business in currencies other than us dollars subjects us to fluctuations in currency exchange rates our primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relate to foreign currencies in brazil europe australia and parts of asia the us dollar value of our net investments in foreign operations the periodic conversion of foreigndenominated earnings to the us dollar our reporting currency our results of operations and in some cases cash flows could be adversely affected in a material manner by movements in foreign currency exchange rates during the twelve months ended december 31 2008 approximately 17 of our revenues were denominated in currencies other than the us dollar including the brazilian real british pound and euro these risks could cause a material adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations and could cause the market value of our common stock to decline 

our existing levels of leverage and debt service requirements may adversely affect our financial and operational flexibility 

as of december 31 2008 we had total debt of approximately 25 billion this level of debt could have important consequences to us including the following i the debt level may cause us to have difficulty borrowing money in the future for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions or other purposes and limits our ability to pursue other business opportunities and implement certain business strategies ii we use a large portion of the money we earn to pay principal and interest on our senior credit facilities which reduces the amount of money available to finance operations acquisitions and other business activities repay other indebtedness and pay shareholder dividends iii some of our debt has a variable rate of interest which exposes us to the risk of increased interest rates and iv we have a higher level of debt than some of our competitors which may cause a competitive disadvantage and may reduce flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions including increased competition 

in addition the terms of our senior credit facilities may restrict us from taking actions such as making significant acquisitions or dispositions or entering into certain agreements which we might believe to be advantageous to us 

if we are unable to successfully consummate and integrate acquisitions our results of operations may be adversely affected 

we have made numerous acquisitions in recent years as a part of our growth strategy we anticipate that we will continue to seek to acquire complementary businesses and services this strategy will depend on the ability to find suitable acquisitions and finance them 

on acceptable terms we may require additional debt or equity financing for future acquisitions and doing so will be made more difficult by our existing debt if we are unable to acquire suitable acquisition candidates we may experience slower growth further after successfully completing acquisitions we face challenges in integrating acquired businesses these challenges include eliminating redundant operations facilities and systems coordinating management and personnel retaining key employees managing different corporate cultures and achieving cost reductions and crossselling opportunities there can be no assurance that we will be able to fully integrate all aspects of acquired businesses successfully or fully realize the potential benefits of bringing them together and the process of integrating these acquisitions may disrupt our business and divert our resources 

we may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect from the lps spinoff 

we may not be able to achieve the strategic and financial benefits we expected to result from the lps spinoff or such benefits may be delayed these outcomes may occur due to among other things the loss of synergies excess costs the two companies will incur as standalone entities or the obligations imposed on us to avoid certain transactions in respect of our capital stock in order to preserve the planned taxfree nature of the transactions 

if any part of the lps spinoff is determined to be a taxable transaction then additional taxes could be imposed on us and our shareholders 

on june 20 2008 we received a favorable private letter ruling from the internal revenue service “irs” regarding the contribution of our interest in the assets liabilities businesses and employees related to our lender processing services operations in exchange for the receipt by us of lps common stock and lps debt obligations which we refer to as the contribution the exchange by us of lps debt obligations for certain outstanding fis debt which we refer to as the debt exchange and the distribution of lps common stock to our shareholders which we refer to as the spinoff the irs ruling was to the effect that i the contribution taking into account the spinoff will qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of section 368a of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended which we refer to as the code in which neither we nor lps will recognize any gain or loss ii no gain or loss will be recognized by us in the debt exchange pursuant to section 361 of the code and iii no gain or loss will be recognized by us or our shareholders on the spinoff pursuant to section 355 and related provisions of the code including section 361c of the code except that any gain that our shareholders realize on cash received in lieu of any fractional shares of our common stock to which such shareholders may be entitled in the spinoff generally will be taxable to our shareholders 

notwithstanding our receipt of the irs private letter ruling the irs could determine that the contribution debt exchange andor spinoff constitute taxable transactions if it determines that there was a misstatement or omission of any of the facts representations or undertakings that were included in the request for the private letter ruling or if it disagrees with our conclusions reached regarding certain factual requirements that consistent with the irs’ standard ruling policy were not covered by the irs ruling 

if one or more of the contribution debt exchange or spinoff transactions ultimately were determined to be subject to tax we would recognize gain and the amount of that gain would be up to the excess of the fair market value of the lps stock and debt obligations we received in the contribution over our basis in the assets we contributed to lps in the contribution the amount of such gain could be substantial further if the spinoff transaction were subject to tax in addition to tax imposed on us our shareholders generally would be treated as if they received a taxable distribution equal to the full fair market value of lps stock on the distribution date in addition we could be subject to tax on certain of the preliminary asset transfers that were made in connection with the contribution transaction 

notwithstanding the favorable irs ruling that the spinoff qualified for taxfree treatment it would become taxable to us pursuant to section 355e of the code if 50 or more of the shares of either our common stock or lps common stock were acquired directly or indirectly as part of a plan or series of related transactions that included the spinoff if the irs were to determine that acquisitions of our common stock or of lps common stock either before or after the spinoff were part of a plan or series of related transactions that included the spinoff this determination could result in the recognition of substantial gain by us under section 355e 

although the taxes resulting from the contribution debt exchange or spinoff not qualifying for taxfree treatment for united states federal income tax purposes generally would be imposed on us and our shareholders under the tax disaffiliation agreement entered into by us and lps in connection with the distribution lps would be required to indemnify us and our affiliates against all tax related liabilities caused by the failure of any of those transactions to qualify for taxfree treatment for united states federal income tax purposes including as a result of section 355e of the code to the extent these liabilities arise as a result of any action taken by lps or any of lps’ affiliates following the spinoff or otherwise result from any breach of any representation covenant or obligation of lps or any of lps’ affiliates under the tax disaffiliation agreement 

there is no guaranty that lps will have financial resources to satisfy any such indemnification obligation described above 

the executive chairman of our board of directors and other officers and directors have interests and positions that could present potential conflicts 

we and certain of our subsidiaries are parties to a variety of related party agreements with fnf and lps william p foley ii who is our executive chairman is currently the chairman of the board of directors of both fnf and lps lee a kennedy who serves as president and chief executive officer of our company is also a director of lps brent b bickett who is an officer of fis is also an officer of fnf and lps william p foley ii and brent b bickett also own or hold substantial amounts of lps and fnf stock and stock options thomas m hagerty and richard n massey who are both directors of fis are also directors of fnf as a result of the foregoing there may be circumstances where certain of our executive officers and directors may be subject to conflicts of interest with respect to among other things i our past and ongoing relationships with fnf and lps including related party agreements and other arrangements with respect to the administration of tax matters employee benefits and indemnification ii the quality pricing and other terms associated with services that we provide to fnf and lps or that they provide to us under related party agreements iii business opportunities arising for either us fnf or lps that could be pursued by either us or by fnf or lps and iv conflicts of time with respect to matters potentially or actually involving or affecting fis 

we seek to manage these potential conflicts through abstention oversight by independent members of our board of directors and provisions in our agreements with fnf and lps however there can be no assurance that such measures will be effective or that we will be able to resolve all potential conflicts with fnf and lps or that the resolution of any such conflicts will be no less favorable to us than if we were dealing with an unaffiliated third party 

we have substantial investments in recorded goodwill and other intangible assets as a result of prior acquisitions and a further more severe or continued economic downturn could cause these investments to become impaired requiring writedowns that would reduce our operating income 

as of december 31 2008 goodwill aggregated to approximately 41940 million 558 of total assets and other indefinite lived intangible assets aggregated to approximately 1520 million 20 of total assets current accounting rules require goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets to be assessed for impairment at least annually or whenever changes in circumstances indicate potential impairment factors that may be considered a change in circumstance include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results a significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization and negative industry or economic trends the results of our fiscal year 2008 annual assessment of the recoverability of goodwill indicated that the fair value of the company’s reporting units were in excess of the carrying value of those reporting units and thus no goodwill impairment existed as of december 31 2008 additionally other than with respect to our certegy check business where we recorded an impairment charge of 520 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 the fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets was in excess of the carry value of those assets however if the current worldwide economic downturn continues the carrying amount of our goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets may no longer be recoverable and we may be required to record an impairment charge which would have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition we will continue to monitor the fair value of our other indefinite lived intangible assets as well as our market capitalization and the impact of the current economic downturn on our business to determine if there is an impairment in future periods 

consolidations and failures in the banking and financial services industry could adversely affect our business by eliminating some of our existing and potential customers and making us more dependent on a more limited number of customers 

there has been and continues to be substantial consolidation activity in the banking and financial services industry in addition many financial institutions that experienced negative operating results including some of our customers have failed 

the failures and consolidations reduce the number of our customers and potential customers which could adversely affect our revenues even if the events do not reduce the aggregate activities of the consolidated entities further if our customers fail andor merge with or are acquired by other entities that are not our customers or that use fewer of our services they may discontinue or reduce use of our services it is also possible that larger financial institutions resulting from consolidations would have greater leverage in negotiating terms or could decide to perform inhouse some or all of the services which we currently provide or could provide any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

losses consolidations and failures in the financial services industry may impact our ability to borrow funds or the ability of our lenders to fulfill their obligations under our interest rate swap agreements 

many financial institutions are currently experiencing negative operating results in some cases these negative operating results have led to financial institution failures andor consolidations including in some cases lenders that are parties to our credit agreement and interest rate swap agreements as a result lenders may become insolvent or tighten lending standards which could in turn make it more difficult or impossible for lenders to perform their obligations under our interest rate swap agreements or for us to borrow under our credit agreement obtain financing on favorable terms or obtain financing or interest rate swap agreements at all our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if a financial institution fails to fulfill its obligations under our interest rate swap agreements or we are unable to draw funds under our credit agreement or obtain other costeffective financing

business trends and conditions 

increases in deposit and card transactions can positively affect our business and thus the condition of the overall economy can have an effect on growth 

we compete for both licensing and outsourcing business and thus are affected by the decisions of financial institutions to utilize our services under an outsourced arrangement or to process inhouse under a software license and maintenance agreement as a provider of outsourcing solutions we benefit from multiyear recurring revenue streams generally demand for outsourcing solutions has increased over time as service providers such as us realize economies of scale and improve their ability to provide services that improve customer efficiencies and reduce costs 

card transactions continue to increase as a percentage of total pointofsale payments which fuels continuing demand for cardrelated services we continue to launch new services aimed at accommodating this demand in recent years we have introduced a variety of storedvalue card types internet banking and electronic bill presentmentpayment services as well as a number of card enhancement and loyaltyreward programs the common theme among these offerings continues to be convenience and security for the consumer coupled with value to the financial institution 

consolidation within the banking industry may be beneficial or detrimental to our businesses when consolidations occur merger partners often operate disparate systems licensed from competing service providers the newly formed entity generally makes a determination to migrate its core systems to a single platform when a financial institution processing client is involved in a consolidation we may benefit by expanding the use of our services if such services are chosen to survive the consolidation and support the newly combined entity conversely we may lose market share if a customer of ours is involved in a consolidation and our services are not chosen to survive the consolidation and support the newly combined entity 

we believe that we are facing one of the most difficult times that has ever existed for financial institutions retailers and other businesses in the united states and internationally we expect there to be a significant number of bank failures in the next few years which may be offset to a degree by somewhat decreased bank acquisition activity however we believe that our potential exposure to bank failures and forced government actions that have occurred to date is less than one half of one percent of our revenues additionally this exposure does not consider any incremental revenues we may generate from potential license fees or service associated with assisting surviving institutions with integrating acquired assets resulting from financial failures we believe that software sales will be the most at risk as far as discretionary purchases that financial institutions may defer however software sales represent approximately 5 of our revenues and thus any decrease should not have a significant impact on our results of operations while we believe that we are well positioned to withstand the current financial crisis there are factors outside our control that might impact our operating results that we may not be able to fully anticipate as to timing and severity including but not limited to adverse effects if banks are nationalized continued global economic conditions worsening causing further slowdown in consumer spending and lending and the impact on our ability to access capital should any or our lenders fail 

critical accounting policies 

the accounting policies described below are those we consider critical in preparing our consolidated financial statements these policies require management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures with respect to contingent liabilities and assets at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods actual amounts could differ from those estimates see note 3 of notes to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed description of the significant accounting policies that have been followed in preparing our consolidated financial statements 

  revenue recognition 

the company generates revenues from the delivery of bank processing and credit and debit card processing services professional services software licensing and software related services and products revenues are recognized when evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred fees are fixed or determinable and collection is considered probable occasionally we are party to multiple concurrent contracts with the same customer these situations require judgment to determine whether the individual contracts should be aggregated or evaluated separately for purposes of revenue recognition in making this determination we consider the timing of negotiating and executing the contracts whether the different elements of the contracts are interdependent and whether any of the payment terms of the contracts are interrelated due to the large number broad nature and average size of individual 

contracts we are party to the impact of judgements and assumptions that we apply in recognizing revenue for any single contract is not likely to have a material effect on our consolidated operations or financial position however the broader accounting policy assumptions that we apply across similar arrangements or classes of customers could significantly influence the timing and amount of revenue recognized in our historical and future results of operations or financial position additional information about our revenue recognition policies is included in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements 

  allowance for doubtful accounts 

the company analyzes trade accounts receivable by considering historical bad debts customer creditworthiness current economic trends changes in customer payment terms and collection trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts any change in the assumptions used in analyzing a specific account receivable may result in an additional allowance for doubtful accounts being recognized in the period in which the change occurs the allowance for doubtful accounts was 406 million and 534 million at december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively the decrease in the allowance for doubtful accounts from 2007 is primarily related to the lps spinoff 

  reserves for check guarantee losses 

in our check guarantee business if a guaranteed check presented to a merchant customer is dishonored by the check writer’s bank we reimburse our merchant customer for the check’s face value and pursue collection of the amount from the delinquent check writer loss reserves and anticipated recoveries are primarily determined by performing a historical analysis of our check loss and recovery experience and considering other factors that could affect that experience in the future such factors include the general economy the overall industry mix of our customer volumes statistical analysis of check fraud trends within our customer volumes and the quality of returned checks once these factors are considered we establish a rate for check losses that is calculated by dividing the expected check losses by dollar volume processed and a rate for anticipated recoveries that is calculated by dividing the anticipated recoveries by the total amount of related check losses these rates are then applied against the dollar volume processed and check losses respectively each month and charged to costs of revenues the estimated check returns and recovery amounts are subject to risk that actual amounts returned and recovered may be different than our estimates 

historically such estimation processes have proven to be materially accurate however our projections of probable check guarantee losses and anticipated recoveries are inherently uncertain and as a result we cannot predict with certainty the amount of such items changes in economic conditions the risk characteristics and composition of our customers and other factors could impact our actual and projected amounts we recorded check guarantee losses net of anticipated recoveries excluding service fees of 981 million and 1138 million respectively for the years ended december 31 2008 and 2007 a ten percent difference in our estimated gross check guarantee losses and our estimated recoveries as of december 31 2008 could impact 2008 net earnings by approximately 22 million aftertax 

  computer software 

computer software includes the fair value of software acquired in business combinations purchased software and capitalized software development costs as of december 31 2008 and 2007 computer software net of accumulated amortization was 6170 million and 7752 million respectively purchased software is recorded at cost and amortized using the straight line method over its estimated useful life and software acquired in business combinations is recorded at its fair value and amortized using straight line and accelerated methods over their estimated useful lives ranging from 3 to 10 years in determining useful lives management considers historical results and technological trends which may influence the estimate amortization expense for computer software was 1499 million 1778 million and 1302 million in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively included in discontinued operations in the consolidated statement of earnings in those years was amortization expense on computer software of 148 million 325 million and 302 million for 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively we also assess the recorded value of computer software for impairment on a regular basis by comparing the carrying value to the estimated future cash flows to be generated by the underlying software asset there are inherent uncertainties in determining the expected useful life or cash flows to be generated from computer software while we have not historically experienced significant changes in these estimates we could be subject to such changes in the future 

  goodwill and other intangible assets 

we are required to allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction at their estimated fair values the estimates used to determine the fair value of longlived assets such as intangible assets are complex and require a significant amount of management judgment we generally engage independent valuation specialists to assist us in making fair value determinations we are also required to estimate the useful lives of intangible assets to determine the amount of acquisitionrelated intangible asset amortization expense to record in future periods we periodically review the estimated useful lives 

assigned to our definitelived intangible assets to determine whether such estimated useful lives continue to be appropriate additionally we review our indefinite lived intangible assets to determine if there is any change in circumstances that may indicate the asset’s useful life is no longer indefinite 

we review the carrying value of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable in accordance with sfas no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets “sfas 142” sfas 142 requires us to perform a twostep impairment test on goodwill first we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value we determine the fair value of our reporting units based on the present value of estimated future cash flows if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the unit’s net assets goodwill is not impaired and further testing is not required if the carrying value of the reporting unit’s net assets exceeds the fair value of the unit then we perform the second step of the impairment test to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill and any impairment charge additionally we estimate the fair value of acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives and compare this amount to the underlying carrying value 

determining the fair value of a reporting unit or acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives involves judgment and the use of significant estimates and assumptions which include assumptions regarding the revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate estimated future cash flows riskadjusted discount rates and future economic and market conditions and other assumptions during the fourth quarter of 2008 immediately prior to our annual measurement date for impairment testing our market capitalization declined to a point below our book value our annual impairment test indicated that no impairment has occurred based on our assumptions of discounted future cash flows using our current best estimate of future performance in december of 2008 upon the change in our reporting segments and in light of the fact that our market capitalization continued to remain below our book value we performed new impairment tests on a segment basis and determined that no impairments existed 

the company has reconciled the aggregate estimated fair value of the reporting units to the market capitalization of the consolidated company we believe that the overall market conditions that existed at the measurement dates and continue to exist because of the financial crisis have led to a market capitalization well below the fair value of a controlling interest based on these factors we concluded that the market capitalization does not represent the fair value of the company 

our analysis of indefinite lived intangible assets did indicate an impairment of our check trademark accordingly we recorded a charge of 520 million to reduce the intangible asset’s carrying value to fair value note 11 given the significance of our goodwill and intangible asset balances an adverse change in fair value could result in an impairment charge which could be material to our financial statements 

  accounting for income taxes 

as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements we are required to determine income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate this process involves estimating actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing recognition of items for income tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred income tax assets and liabilities which are included within the consolidated balance sheets we must then assess the likelihood that deferred income tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely establish a valuation allowance to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period we must reflect this increase as an expense within income tax expense in the statement of earnings determination of the income tax expense requires estimates and can involve complex issues that may require an extended period to resolve further changes in the geographic mix of revenues or in the estimated level of annual pretax income can cause the overall effective income tax rate to vary from period to period we believe that our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that we adequately provide for any known tax contingencies we believe the estimates and assumptions used to support our evaluation of tax benefit realization are reasonable however final determination of prioryear tax liabilities either by settlement with tax authorities or expiration of statutes of limitations could be materially different than estimates reflected in assets and liabilities and historical income tax provisions the outcome of these final determinations could have a material effect on our income tax provision net income or cash flows in the period that determination is made 

related party transactions 

we are a party to certain historical related party agreements with fnf lps and other related parties see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of part ii of this report 

factors affecting comparability 

our consolidated financial statements included in this report that present our financial condition and operating results reflect the following significant transactions 

 

although the legal entity that survived the certegy merger was certegy which has since been renamed fidelity national information services inc for accounting purposes our historical financial statements are those of fis our consolidated financial statements include the results of operations of certegy from the date of the acquisition 

as a result of the above transactions the results of operations in the periods covered by the consolidated financial statements may not be directly comparable

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 157 fair value measurements “sfas 157” sfas 157 defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements by establishing a fair value hierarchy based on the quality of inputs used to measure fair value sfas 157 does not require any new fair value measurements but applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements sfas 157 is effective for financial statements for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 the company adopted sfas 157 as of january 1 2008 items in our consolidated financial statements for which sfas 157 is already effective are discussed in the financing section of management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

in february 2008 the fasb issued fasb staff position sfas no 1572 effective date of fasb statement no 157 which delays the effective date of sfas 157 with respect to nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are not remeasured at fair value on a recurring basis until fiscal years beginning after november 15 2008 accordingly the company has not yet applied the 

disclosure requirements of sfas 157 to certain such nonfinancial assets for which fair value measurements are determined on a nonrecurring basis only when there is an indication of potential impairment 

the fair value hierarchy established by sfas 157 includes three levels which are based on the priority of the inputs to the valuation technique the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level 1 and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs level 3 if the inputs used to measure the financial instruments fall within different levels of the hierarchy the categorization is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the instrument in accordance with sfas 157 our financial assets and liabilities that are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets are categorized based on the inputs to the valuation techniques as follows 

level 1 financial assets and liabilities whose values are based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in an active market that we have the ability to access 

level 2 financial assets and liabilities whose values are based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or model inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly for substantially the full term of the asset or liability 

level 3 financial assets and liabilities whose values are based on model inputs that are unobservable 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risks 

market risk 

we are exposed to market risks primarily from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates in managing exposure to these fluctuations we may engage in various hedging transactions that have been authorized according to documented policies and procedures on a limited basis we use certain derivative financial instruments including interest rate swaps to manage these risks we do not use derivatives for trading purposes to generate income or to engage in speculative activity our capital costs are directly linked to financial and business risks we seek to manage the potential negative effects from market volatility and market risk it is our policy to manage our debt structure in order to manage capital costs control financial risks and maintain financial flexibility over the long term 

interest rate risk 

we have issued debt in floating rate instruments interest rate swaps are used for the purpose of controlling interest expense by managing the mix of fixed and floating rate debt we do not seek to make a profit from changes in interest rates we manage interest rate sensitivity by measuring potential increases in interest expense that would result from a probable change in interest rates when the potential increase in interest expense exceeds an acceptable amount we reduce risk through the purchase of derivatives 

as of december 31 2008 we are paying interest on the revolving loan at libor plus 070 and at libor plus 088 on our term loan a a one percent increase in the libor rate would increase our annual debt service on the credit agreement by 39 million based on principal amounts outstanding at december 31 2008 net of interest rate swaps the credit rating assigned to fis by standard  poor’s was bb at december 31 2008 

we have entered into the following interest rate swap transactions converting a portion of the interest rate exposure on our term and revolving loans from variable to fixed in millions 

 

 

 29 

we are subject to foreign exchange risk for foreign currencydenominated transactions such as debt issued recognized payables and receivables and forecasted transactions changes in foreign currency exchange rates also affect translations of revenues denominated in currencies other than us dollars our international operations generated approximately 7600 million in revenues in 2008 of which approximately 6140 million was denominated in currencies other than the us dollar the major currencies that we are exposed to are the brazilian real the euro and the british pound sterling a 5 move in average exchange rates for these currencies would have had the following effect on 2008 reported revenues 

 

in the future we may enter into agreements to hedge our risks against foreign currency movements but historically we have not entered into any such agreements however any hedging strategies may not be successful and any future unhedged foreign exchange payments could be subject to market fluctuations

competition 

 

our primary competitors include internal technology departments within banks data processing or software development departments of large companies or large computer manufacturers thirdparty payment processors independent computer services firms companies that develop and deploy software applications companies that provide customized development implementation and support services and companies that market software for the electronic payment industry some of these competitors possess substantially greater financial sales and marketing resources than we do competitive factors for applications and services include the quality of the technologybased application or service application features and functions ease of delivery and integration ability of the provider to maintain enhance and support the applications or services and price we believe that we compete favorably in each of these categories in addition we believe that our financial institution industry expertise combined with our ability to offer multiple applications services and integrated solutions to individual customers enhances our competitiveness against competitors with more limited application offerings 

 

we compete with vendors that offer similar core processing applications and services to financial institutions including fiserv inc jack henry and associates inc metavante corporation open solutions ibm and accenture in certain nonus markets we compete with regional providers including alnova iflex and temenos 

 

our competitors in the card issuer services market include thirdparty credit and debit card processors such as first data corporation total system services electronic data systems corporation and payment systems for credit unions and thirdparty software providers which license their card processing systems to financial institutions and thirdparty processors competitors in the check risk management services market include first data’s telecheck services division crosscheck and global payments 

 

the markets for our information outsourcing business lines are also highly competitive key competitive factors include quality of the service convenience speed of delivery customer service and price we do not believe that there is a competitor currently offering the scope of services and market coverage that we provide in our information outsourcing business however there are a number of competitors in specific lines some of which have substantial resources first american and land america are significant competitors in a majority of our information outsourcing business lines including tax flood appraisal and default

government regulation 

 

various aspects of our businesses are subject to federal state and foreign regulation our failure to comply with any applicable laws and regulations could result in restrictions on our ability to provide our services as well as the imposition of civil fines and criminal penalties 

 

as a provider of electronic data processing and backoffice services to financial institutions such as banks thrifts and credit unions we are subject to regulatory oversight and examination by the federal financial institutions examination council an interagency body of the federal deposit insurance corporation the office of thrift supervision the office of the comptroller of the currency the board of governors of the federal reserve system the national credit union administration and various state regulatory authorities in addition independent auditors annually review several of our operations to provide reports on internal controls for our customers’ auditors and regulators we also may be subject to possible review by state agencies that regulate banks in each state in which we conduct our electronic processing activities 

 

beginning july 1 2001 financial institutions were required to comply with privacy regulations imposed under the grammleachbliley act these regulations place restrictions on financial institutions’ use of nonpublic personal information all financial institutions must disclose detailed privacy policies to their customers and offer them the opportunity to direct the financial institution not to share information with third parties the new regulations however permit financial institutions to share information with nonaffiliated parties who perform services for the financial institutions as a provider of services to financial institutions we are required to comply with the privacy regulations and are bound by the same limitations on disclosure of the information received from our customers as apply to the financial institutions themselves 

 

given that one of the databases that we maintain in the us contains certain data pertaining to the checkwriting histories of consumers and that data is used to provide certain check risk management services our check risk management business is subject to the federal fair credit reporting act and various similar state laws among other things the fair credit reporting act imposes requirements on us concerning data accuracy and provides that consumers have the right to know the contents of their checkwriting histories to dispute their accuracy and to require verification or removal of disputed information in furtherance of our objectives of data accuracy fair treatment of consumers protection of consumers’ personal information and compliance with these laws we maintain a high level of security for our computer systems in which consumer data resides and we maintain consumer relations call centers to facilitate efficient handling of consumer requests for information and handling of disputes 

 

our check collection services are subject to the federal fair debt collection practices act and various state collection laws and licensing requirements the federal trade commission as well as state attorneys general and other agencies have enforcement responsibility over the collection laws as well as the various credit reporting laws 

 

elements of our cash access business are registered as a money services business and are subject to the usa patriot act and reporting requirements of the bank secrecy act and us treasury regulations this business is also 

subject to various state local and tribal licensing requirements the financial crimes enforcement network state attorneys general and other agencies have enforcement responsibility over laws relating to money laundering currency transmission and licensing 

 

the real estate settlement procedures act or respa and related regulations generally prohibit the payment or receipt of fees or any other item of value for the referral of a real estatesecured loan to a loan broker or lender and prohibit fee shares or splits of unearned fees in connection with the provision of residential real estate settlement services such as mortgage brokerage and real estate brokerage notwithstanding these prohibitions respa permits payments for goods furnished or for services actually performed so long as those payments bear a reasonable relationship to the market value of the goods or services provided respa and related regulations may to some extent restrict our real estaterelated businesses from entering into certain preferred alliance arrangements the us department of housing and urban development is responsible for enforcing respa 

 

real estate appraisers are subject to regulation in most states and some state appraisal boards have sought to prohibit certain valuation products including our automated valuation applications courts have limited such prohibitions in part on the ground of preemption by the federal financial institutions reform recovery and enforcement act of 1989 but we cannot assure you that our valuation and appraisal services business will not be subject to regulation 

 

the title agency and related services we provide are conducted through an underwritten title company title agencies and individual title agents and escrow officers the regulation of an underwritten title company is generally limited to requirements to maintain specified levels of net worth and working capital and to obtain and maintain appropriate licenses for the jurisdictions in which it operates the title agencies and individual escrow officers are also subject to regulation by the insurance or banking regulators in many jurisdictions these regulators generally require among other items that agents and individuals obtain and maintain a license and be appointed by a title insurer we also own a small title insurer which issues policies generated by our direct and agency operations in relatively limited circumstances this insurer is domiciled in new york and is therefore subject to regulation by the insurance regulatory authorities of that state among other things no person may acquire 10 or more of our common stock without the approval of the new york insurance regulators 

 

the california department of insurance has recently proposed implementing rate reductions in the title insurance industry in california florida new mexico and texas have also announced reviews of title insurance rates and other states could follow at this stage we are unable to predict what the outcome will be of these or any similar processes any such rate reductions could adversely affect our revenues from our title agency services 

 

given that we conduct business in international markets as well as in the us we are subject to laws and regulations in jurisdictions outside the us that regulate many of the same activities that are described above including electronic data processing and backoffice services for financial institutions and use of consumer information 

 

the irs has proposed regulations under section 468b regarding the taxation of the income earned on escrow accounts trusts and other funds used during deferred exchanges of likekind property and under section 7872 regarding belowmarket loans to facilitators of these exchanges the proposed regulations affect taxpayers that engage in likekind exchanges and escrow holders trustees qualified intermediaries and others that hold funds during likekind exchanges we currently do not know what effect these changes will have on our 1031 exchange businesses 

 

although we do not believe that compliance with future laws and regulations related to our businesses including future consumer protection laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on our company enactment of new laws and regulations may increasingly affect the operations of our business directly or indirectly which could result in substantial regulatory compliance costs litigation expense adverse publicity andor loss of revenue 

employees 

 

as of december 31 2007 we had approximately 31000 employees including approximately 12000 employees principally employed outside of the us none of our us workforce currently is unionized we have not experienced any work stoppages and we consider our relations with employees to be good

 item 1a   risk factors tableend  

in addition to the normal risks of business we are subject to significant risks and uncertainties including those listed below and others described elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k any of the risks described herein could result in a significant adverse effect on our results of operation and financial condition 

 

if we fail to adapt our services to changes in technology or in the marketplace or if our ongoing efforts to upgrade our technology are not successful we could lose customers and have difficulty attracting new customers for our services 

 

the markets for our services are characterized by constant technological changes frequent introductions of new services and evolving industry standards our future success will be significantly affected by our ability to enhance our current services and develop and introduce new services that address the increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers and their clients these initiatives carry the risks associated with any new service development effort including cost overruns delays in delivery and performance issues there can be no assurance that we will be successful in developing marketing and selling new services that meet these changing demands that we will not experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development introduction and marketing of these services or that our new services and their enhancements will adequately meet the demands of the marketplace and achieve market acceptance 

 

we operate in a competitive business environment and if we are unable to compete effectively our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 

 

the market for our services is intensely competitive our competitors vary in size and in the scope and breadth of the services they offer some of our competitors have substantial resources we face direct competition from third parties and since many of our larger potential customers have historically developed their key applications inhouse and therefore view their system requirements from a makeversusbuy perspective we often compete against our potential customers’ inhouse capacities in addition we expect that the markets in which we compete will continue to attract new competitors and new technologies there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors or that competitive pressures we face in the markets in which we operate will not materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our substantial leverage and debt service requirements may adversely affect our financial and operational flexibility 

 

as of december 31 2007 we had total debt of approximately 43 billion this high level of debt could have important consequences to us including the following 

 

  

in addition the terms of our senior credit facilities may restrict us from taking actions such as making significant acquisitions or dispositions or entering into certain agreements which we might believe to be advantageous to us 

 

if we are unable to successfully consummate and integrate acquisitions our results of operations may be adversely affected 

 

as part of our growth strategy we have made numerous acquisitions in recent years we anticipate that we will continue to seek to acquire complementary businesses and services this strategy will depend on the ability to find suitable acquisitions and finance them on acceptable terms we may require additional debt or equity financing for future acquisitions and doing so will be made more difficult by our substantial debt if we are unable to acquire suitable acquisition candidates we may experience slower growth 

 

further even if we successfully complete acquisitions we will face challenges in integrating any acquired business these challenges include eliminating redundant operations facilities and systems coordinating management and personnel retaining key employees managing different corporate cultures and achieving cost reductions and crossselling opportunities there can be no assurance that we will be able to fully integrate all aspects of acquired businesses successfully or fully realize the potential benefits of bringing them together and the process of integrating these acquisitions may disrupt our business and divert our resources 

 

consolidation in the banking and financial services industry could adversely affect our revenues by eliminating some of our existing and potential customers and could make us more dependent on a more limited number of customers 

 

there has been and continues to be substantial merger acquisition and consolidation activity in the banking and financial services industry mergers or consolidations of banks and financial institutions in the future could reduce the number of our customers and potential customers which could adversely affect our revenues even if these events do not reduce the aggregate number of customers or the banking and other activities of the consolidated entities if our customers merge with or are acquired by other entities that are not our customers or that use fewer of our services they may discontinue or reduce their use of our services in addition it is possible that the larger banks or financial institutions resulting from mergers or consolidations could decide to perform inhouse some or all of the services which we currently provide or could provide any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

demand for many of our services is sensitive to the level of consumer transactions generated by our customers and accordingly our revenues could be impacted negatively by a general economic slowdown or any other event causing a material slowing of consumer spending 

 

a significant portion of our revenue is derived from transaction processing fees any changes in economic factors that adversely affect consumer spending and related consumer debt or a reduction in check writing or credit and debit card usage could reduce the volume of transactions that we process and have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

potential customers may be reluctant to switch to a new vendor which may adversely affect our growth both in the us and internationally 

 

for banks and other potential customers of our financial information software and services switching from one vendor of bank core processing or related software and services or from an internallydeveloped system to a new vendor is a significant undertaking many potential customers worry about potential disadvantages such as loss of accustomed functionality increased costs and business disruption as a result potential customers both in the us and internationally often resist change we seek to overcome this resistance through strategies such as making investments to enhance the functionality of our software however there can be no assurance that our strategies for overcoming potential customers’ reluctance to change vendors will be successful and this resistance may adversely affect our growth both in the us and internationally 

 

decreased lending and real estate activity may reduce demand for certain of our services and adversely affect our results of operations 

 

real estate sales are affected by a number of factors including mortgage interest rates the availability of funds to finance purchases the level of home prices and general economic conditions the volume of refinancing transactions in particular and mortgage originations in general declined in 2005 2006 and 2007 from 2004 levels resulting in reduction of revenues in some of our businesses the current mba forecast is for 20 trillion of mortgage originations in 2008 compared to 23 trillion in 2007 our revenues in future periods will continue to be subject to these and other factors which are beyond our control and as a result are likely to fluctuate 

 

further in the event that levels of home ownership were to decline or other factors were to reduce the aggregate number of us mortgage loans our revenues from mortgage processing and related services could be adversely affected 

 

we could have conflicts with fnf and the executive chairman of our board of directors and other officers and directors could have conflicts of interest due to their relationships with fnf 

 

conflicts may arise between fnf and us as a result of our ongoing agreements and the nature of our respective businesses among other things we and certain of our subsidiaries are parties to a variety of related party agreements with fnf certain of our executive officers and directors will be subject to conflicts of interest with respect to such related party agreements and other matters due to their relationships with fnf 

 

some of the fnf executive officers and directors who became executive officers and directors of our company in connection with the fnf merger including william p foley ii and brent b bickett own substantial amounts of fnf stock and stock options because of their relationships with fnf and old fnf prior to the fnf merger such ownership could create or appear to create potential conflicts of interest when our directors and officers are faced with decisions that involve fnf or any of its respective subsidiaries 

 

mr foley who became our executive chairman in connection with the fnf merger is currently the chairman of the board of directors of fnf mr bickett also became an officer of our company and fnf as a result each of these individuals has obligations to us as well as to fnf and will have conflicts of interest with respect to matters potentially or actually involving or affecting us and fnf 

matters that could give rise to conflicts between us and fnf include among other things 

 

  

we will seek to manage these potential conflicts through dispute resolution and other provisions of our agreements with fnf and through oversight by independent members of our board of directors however there can be no assurance that such measures will be effective or that we will be able to resolve all potential conflicts with fnf or that the resolution of any such conflicts will be no less favorable to us than if we were dealing with an unaffiliated third party 

 

we may lack adequate oversight since the chairman of the board of directors of fnf is also our executive chairman 

 

mr foley is executive chairman of our board of directors mr foley is also the chairman of the board of directors of fnf as a result of his roles he has obligations to us as well as fnf and may have conflicts of time with respect to matters potentially or actually involving or affecting us as executive chairman it is expected that mr foley will devote no more than onehalf of his time to matters relating to us if mr foley’s duties as executive chairman of our board of directors require more time than he is able to allot then his oversight of the activities of our company could be diminished and the effective management of our company could be adversely affected 

 

our revenues from the sale of services to the visa and mastercard organizations are dependent upon our continued visa and mastercard certification and financial institution sponsorship and the loss or suspension of this certification or sponsorship could adversely affect our business 

 

in order to provide our card services we must be designated a certified processor by and be a member service provider of mastercard and be designated as an independent sales organization of visa these designations are dependent upon our continuing adherence to the standards of the visa and mastercard associations the member financial institutions of visa and mastercard some of which are our competitors set the standards with which we must comply if we fail to comply with these standards our designation as a certified processor as a member service provider or as an independent sales organization could be suspended or terminated the termination of our member service provider status or our status as a certified processor or any changes in the visa and mastercard rules that prevent our registration or otherwise limit our ability to provide transaction processing and marketing services for the visa or mastercard organizations would result in the loss of business from visa or mastercard issuing customers and lead to a reduction in our revenues which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business 

 

we have a long sales cycle for many of our applications and if we fail to close sales after expending significant time and resources to do so our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 

 

the implementation of many of our applications often involves significant capital commitments by our customers particularly those with smaller operational scale potential customers generally commit significant resources to an evaluation of available software and require us to expend substantial time effort and money educating them as to the value of our software and services we incur substantial costs in order to obtain each new customer we may expend significant funds and management resources during the sales cycle and ultimately fail to close the sale our sales cycle may be extended due to our customers’ budgetary constraints or for other reasons if we are unsuccessful in closing sales after expending significant funds and management resources or we experience delays it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in the wake of the current mortgage crisis there could be adverse regulatory consequences or litigation that could affect us 

 

various aspects of our businesses are subject to federal state and foreign regulation the sharp rise in home foreclosures that started in the united states during the fall of 2006 and has accelerated in 2007 and 2008 has begun to result in investigations and lawsuits against various parties commenced by various governmental authorities and third parties it has also resulted in governmental review of aspects of the mortgage lending business which may lead to greater regulation in areas such as appraisals default management loan closings and regulatory reporting such actions and proceedings could have consequences that could adversely affect our business 

 

completion of the spinoff is subject to various risks 

 

on october 25 2007 we announced our intention to pursue the spinoff of the businesses that primarily comprise our lps operations there is no guarantee the proposed spinoff will be finalized completion of the spinoff is subject to a number of specific factors and conditions as well as to the discretion of our board of directors which may be influenced by market conditions or other factors for example it is a condition to completing the spinoff that we receive a private letter ruling from the irs and an opinion of our special tax adviser together to the effect that for united states federal income tax purposes the following transactions will qualify as taxfree transactions to us the spunoff entity and our stockholders i the contribution of all of our interest in the assets liabilities businesses and employees related to our lps operations in exchange for the receipt by us of lps inc common stock and lps inc debt obligations the “contribution” ii the expected exchange by us of the lps inc debt obligations for certain of our outstanding debt the “debt exchange” and iii the distribution of lps inc common stock to our stockholders except that any gain that our stockholders realize on cash received in lieu of any fractional shares of lps inc common stock to which such stockholders may be entitled in the distribution generally will be taxable to the stockholders the proposed spinoff is also subject to the sec having declared effective the registration statement for the new shares and the listing of lps inc common stock on the nyse having been approved among other conditions 

 

if the spinoff is not completed we will have incurred costs without any corresponding benefit further our management will have spent time executing the plan which may be a distraction from its day to day activities 

 

we andor lps may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect will be achieved from the spinoff 

 

we and lps inc may not be able to achieve the full strategic and financial benefits we expect will result from the spinoff or such benefits may be delayed or not occur at all these outcomes may occur due to among other things the leverage to be incurred by lps inc in connection with the spinoff the loss of synergies excess costs the two companies will incur as standalone entities or the obligations imposed on lps inc and us to avoid certain transactions in respect of our capital stock in order to preserve the planned taxfree nature of the transactions 

 

finally notwithstanding our receipt of the irs private letter ruling and opinion of our special tax adviser the irs could determine that the contribution debt exchange andor spinoff should be treated as taxable transactions if it determines that there was a misstatement or omission of any of the facts representations or undertakings that were included in the request for the private letter ruling or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion that are not covered by the irs ruling in such case we and our shareholders could be subject to significant tax liabilities 

 

if old fnf’s 2006 spinoff of fnf does not constitute a tax free distribution under section 355e of the internal revenue code or if our merger with old fnf does not constitute a tax free reorganization under section 368a then we may suffer losses resulting from payment of taxes and taxrelated losses 

 

under a tax disaffiliation agreement which we were required to enter into with old fnf and fnf as a condition to the closing under our merger agreement with old fnf fnf is required to indemnify us for taxes and taxrelated losses including stockholder suits if old fnf’s 2006 spinoff of fnf the “2006 distribution” were determined to be taxable either to old fnf and us as its successor or the fnf stockholders or both unless such adverse determination were the result of a breach by us of our agreement not to take any action within our control that would cause the 2006 distribution to be taxable or the result of an acquisition of fis stock within the control of 

us or a subsidiary in such an event old fnf estimated that the amount of tax on the transfer of fnf’s stock in the distribution could be in the range of 150 million and possibly greater depending on among other things the value of fnf’s stock at the time of the 2006 distribution in addition fnf is required under the tax disaffiliation agreement to indemnify old fnf and us as its successor for taxes and taxrelated losses including stockholder suits in the event the old fnffis merger were determined to be taxable old fnf estimated that the amount of tax on old fnf’s transfer and retirement of its fis stock in the merger could be in the range of 1 billion and possibly greater depending on among other things the value of our stock at the time of the merger 

 

even if the 2006 distribution otherwise qualifies as a spinoff under section 355 of the code the distribution of fnf common stock to the old fnf stockholders in connection with the 2006 distribution would not qualify as taxfree to old fnf or us as its successor under section 355e of the code if 50 or more of the stock of old fnf including us as successor to old fnf or fnf is acquired as part of a plan or series of related transactions that includes the 2006 distribution as a result of our merger with old fnf approximately 49 of our stock would be treated as having been acquired pursuant to a plan that includes the 2006 distribution for purposes of section 355e of the code 

 

there is no guaranty that fnf will have financial resources to satisfy any such indemnification obligation described above if the taxfree status is lost because of any action taken by us or any of our subsidiaries after the time of the 2006 distribution except for certain actions specifically identified in the tax disaffiliation agreement we would be required to pay the taxes described above ourself and would be required to indemnify fnf for all taxrelated losses 

 

we may be affected by significant restrictions following the fnf merger with respect to certain actions that could jeopardize the taxfree status of the spinoff by old fnf of fidelity national title group or the fnf merger 

 

in order to preserve the taxfree treatment of the spinoff by old fnf of fidelity national title group a tax disaffiliation agreement entered into by fnf and us prior to the closing under the fnf merger agreement restricts us for two years after the spinoff from taking certain actions within our control that could cause the spinoff to be taxable without first obtaining a consent of certain officers of fnf or obtaining an opinion from a nationally recognized law firm or accounting firm that such action will not cause the spinoff to be taxable to fnf under section 355e of the code in general such actions would include engaging in certain transactions involving i the acquisition of our stock or ii the issuance of shares of our stock 

 

because of these restrictions we may be limited in the amount of stock that we can issue to make acquisitions or raise additional capital in the two years subsequent to the spinoff and the fnf merger and in our ability to repurchase shares of our common stock 

 

we may experience software defects development delays and installation difficulties which would harm our business and reputation and expose us to potential liability 

 

many of our services are based on sophisticated software and computing systems and we may encounter delays when developing new applications and services further the software underlying our services has occasionally contained and may in the future contain undetected errors or defects when first introduced or when new versions are released in addition we may experience difficulties in installing or integrating our technologies on platforms used by our customers defects in our software errors or delays in the processing of electronic transactions or other difficulties could result in 

 

 16 

 

  

although we attempt to limit our potential liability through disclaimers and limitationofliability provisions in our license and customer agreements we cannot be certain that these measures will be successful in limiting our liability 

 

security breaches or computer viruses could harm our business by disrupting our delivery of services and damaging our reputation 

 

as part of our business we electronically receive process store and transmit sensitive business information of our customers in addition we collect personal consumer data such as names and addresses social security numbers driver’s license numbers checking and savings account numbers and payment history records unauthorized access to our computer systems or databases could result in the theft or publication of confidential information or the deletion or modification of records or could otherwise cause interruptions in our operations these concerns about security are increased when we transmit information over the internet computer viruses have also been distributed and have rapidly spread over the internet computer viruses could infiltrate our systems disrupting our delivery of services and making our applications unavailable any inability to prevent security breaches or computer viruses could also cause existing customers to lose confidence in our systems and terminate their agreements with us and could inhibit our ability to attract new customers 

 

many of our customers are subject to a regulatory environment and to industry standards that may change in a manner that reduces the number of transactions in which our customers engage and therefore reduces our revenues 

 

our customers are subject to a number of government regulations and industry standards with which our services must comply for example our services are affected by visa and mastercard electronic payment standards that are generally updated twice annually in addition action by regulatory authorities relating to credit availability data usage privacy or other related regulatory developments could have an adverse effect on our customers and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

if we fail to comply with privacy regulations imposed on providers of services to financial institutions our business could be harmed 

 

as a provider of services to financial institutions we are bound by the same limitations on disclosure of the information we receive from our customers as apply to the financial institutions themselves if we fail to comply with these regulations we could be exposed to suits for breach of contract or to governmental proceedings our customer relationships and reputation could be harmed and we could be inhibited in our ability to obtain new customers in addition if more restrictive privacy laws or rules are adopted in the future on the federal or state level or with respect to our international operations by authorities in foreign jurisdictions on the national provincial state or other level that could have an adverse impact on us 

 

if we experience system failures the services we provide to our customers could be delayed or interrupted which could harm our business and reputation and result in the loss of customers 

 

our ability to provide reliable service in a number of our businesses depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operations of our computer network systems and data centers our systems and operations could be exposed to damage or interruption from fire natural disaster power loss telecommunications failure unauthorized entry and computer viruses although we have taken steps to prevent system failures we cannot be certain that our measures 

will be successful further our property and business interruption insurance may not be adequate to compensate us for all losses or failures that may occur any significant interruptions could 

 

  

any one or more of the foregoing occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

we face liability to our merchant customers if checks that we have guaranteed are dishonored by the check writer’s bank 

 

if a check that we have guaranteed is dishonored by the check writer’s bank we must reimburse our merchant customer for the check’s face value and pursue collection of the amount from the delinquent check writer in some cases we recognize a liability to our merchant customers for estimated check returns and a receivable for amounts we estimate we will recover from the check writers based on historical experience and other relevant factors the estimated check returns and recovery amounts are subject to the risk that actual amounts returned may exceed our estimates and actual amounts recovered may be less than our estimates 

 

misappropriation of our intellectual property and proprietary rights could impair our competitive position 

 

our ability to compete depends upon proprietary systems and technology despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our services or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary policing unauthorized use of our proprietary rights is difficult we cannot make any assurances that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of technology or that the agreements entered into for that purpose will be enforceable effective trademark service mark copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our applications and services are made available online misappropriation of our intellectual property or potential litigation concerning such matters could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 

 

if our applications or services are found to infringe the proprietary rights of others we may be required to change our business practices and may also become subject to significant costs and monetary penalties 

 

as our information technology applications and services develop we may become increasingly subject to infringement claims any claims whether with or without merit could 

 

  

we may not succeed with our current and future expansion of our international operations and such failure may adversely affect our growth and results of operations 

 

in 2007 sales outside of the us represented approximately 112 of our revenues we believe there are additional opportunities to expand our international operations and we expect to commit significant resources to 

expand our international sales and marketing activities however overall we are less wellknown internationally than in the united states and have less experience with local business conditions in addition we will face challenges in successfully managing small operations located far from our headquarters because of the greater difficulty in overseeing and guiding operations from a distance and we will be increasingly subject to a number of other risks and potential costs including 

 

  

there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future international competitors 

 

misappropriation of consumer data by a former employee could materially adversely affect our relationship with governing organizations customers or regulators 

 

on july 3 2007 we announced that a database administrator had misappropriated consumer information to date we have seen no evidence of the stolen information being used for anything other than marketing purposes nevertheless multiple putative class action lawsuits were filed against us seeking monetary damages those class actions were settled in january of 2008 and the settlement received preliminary approval from the court in february of 2008 although we do not believe that we face any material liability there can be no assurance that this matter will not result in fines or other charges or adversely impact our relationships with the visa and mastercard issuing organizations customers or regulators

on september 12 2007 we completed the efunds acquisition the efunds businesses have been integrated into our operations within our tps segment 

 

business trends and conditions 

 

transaction processing services 

 

in the tps business increases in deposit and card transactions can positively affect our business and thus the condition of the overall economy can have an effect on growth 

 

in this segment we compete for both licensing and outsourcing business and thus are affected by the decisions of financial institutions to utilize our services under an outsourced arrangement or to process inhouse under a software license and maintenance agreement as a provider of outsourcing solutions we benefit from multiyear recurring revenue streams generally demand for outsourcing solutions has increased over time as providers such as us realize economies of scale and improve their ability to provide services that improve customer efficiencies and reduce costs 

 

card transactions continue to increase as a percentage of total pointofsale payments which fuels continuing demand for cardrelated services we continue to launch new services aimed at accommodating this demand in recent years we have introduced a variety of storedvalue card types internet banking and electronic bill presentmentpayment services as well as a number of card enhancement and loyaltyreward programs the common theme among these offerings continues to be convenience and security for the consumer coupled with value to the financial institution 

 

consolidation within the banking industry may be beneficial or detrimental to the tps businesses when consolidations occur merger partners often operate disparate systems licensed from competing service providers the newly formed entity generally makes a determination to migrate its core systems to a single platform when a financial institution processing client is involved in a consolidation we may benefit by expanding the use of our services if such services are chosen to survive the consolidation and support the newly combined entity conversely we may lose market share if a customer of ours is involved in a consolidation and our services are not chosen to survive the consolidation and support the newly combined entity 

lender processing services 

 

our mortgage processing services business driven by msp is largely subject to the number of residential mortgage loans outstanding which is influenced by overall home ownership the level of residential real estate activity which depends in part on the level of interest rates affects the level of revenues from many of the other businesses in the lps segment 

 

the slow down of real estate activity and the tightening of available credit in 2007 has resulted in a reduction in new loan origination and refinancing activity the current mba forecast is for 20 trillion of mortgage originations in 2008 as compared to 23 trillion in 2007 these factors are also likely to result in seasonal effects having more influence on real estate activity traditionally the greatest volume of real estate activity particularly residential resale transactions has occurred in the spring and summer months 

 

in contrast current market conditions have increased the volume of residential mortgage defaults and thus favorably affected our default management services which provide services relating to residential mortgage loans in default the overall strength of the economy also affects default revenues 

 

critical accounting policies 

 

the accounting policies described below are those we consider critical in preparing our consolidated and combined financial statements these policies require management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures with respect to contingent liabilities and assets at the date of the consolidated and combined financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods actual amounts could differ from those estimates see note 3 of notes to the consolidated and combined financial statements for a more detailed description of the significant accounting policies that have been followed in preparing our consolidated and combined financial statements 

 

revenue recognition 

 

we recognize revenues in accordance with securities and exchange commission “sec” staff accounting bulletin no 104 “sab no 104” revenue recognition and related interpretations financial accounting standards board “fasb” emerging issues task force no 0021 “eitf 0021” revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  american institute of certified public accountant’s sop no 972 “software revenue recognition” “sop 972” sop no 989 modification of sop no 972 software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions “sop 989” and sop no 811 accounting for performance of construction type and certain productiontype contracts “sop 811” recording revenues under the provisions of these pronouncements requires judgment including determining whether or not an arrangement includes multiple elements whether any of the elements are essential to the functionality of any other elements and whether evidence of fair value exists for those elements customers receive certain contract elements over time and changes to the elements in an arrangement or in our ability to identify fair value for these elements could materially impact the amount of earned and unearned revenue reflected in our financial statements 

 

the primary judgments relating to our revenue recognition are determining when all of the following criteria are met under sab 104 1 persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 2 delivery has occurred or services have been rendered 3 the seller’s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and 4 collectibility is reasonably assured under eitf 0021 judgment is also required to determine whether an arrangement involving more than one deliverable contains more than one unit of accounting and how the arrangement consideration should be measured and allocated to the separate units of accounting 

 

if the deliverables under a contract are software related as determined under sop 972 or sop 989 we apply these pronouncements and related interpretations to determine the appropriate units of accounting and how the arrangement consideration should be measured and allocated to the separate units this determination as well as management’s ability to establish vendor specific objective evidence “vsoe” for the individual deliverables can impact both the amount and timing of revenue recognition under these agreements the inability to establish vsoe for each contract deliverable results in having to record deferred revenues andor applying the residual method as defined in sop 989 for arrangements where we determine vsoe for software maintenance using a stated renewal 

rate within the contract we use judgment to determine whether the renewal rate represents fair value for that element as if it had been sold on a standalone basis for a small percentage of revenues we use contract accounting as required by sop no 972 when the arrangement with the customer includes significant customization modification or production of software for elements accounted for under contract accounting revenue is recognized in accordance with sop 811 accounting for performance of construction type and certain productiontype contracts  using the percentageofcompletion method since reasonably dependable estimates of revenues and contract hours applicable to various elements of a contract can be made 

 

occasionally we are party to multiple concurrent contracts with the same customer these situations require judgment to determine whether the individual contracts should be aggregated or evaluated separately for purposes of revenue recognition in making this determination we consider the timing of negotiating and executing the contracts whether the different elements of the contracts are interdependent and whether any of the payment terms of the contracts are interrelated 

 

due to the large number broad nature and average size of individual contracts we are a party to the impact of judgments and assumptions that we apply in recognizing revenue for any single contract is not likely to have a material effect on our consolidated operations however the broader accounting policy assumptions that we apply across similar arrangements or classes of customers could significantly influence the timing and amount of revenue recognized in our historical and future results of operations or financial position 

 

reserves for check guarantee losses 

 

in our check guarantee business if a guaranteed check presented to a merchant customer is dishonored by the check writer’s bank we reimburse our merchant customer for the check’s face value and pursue collection of the amount from the delinquent check writer loss reserves and anticipated recoveries are primarily determined by performing a historical analysis of our check loss and recovery experience and considering other factors that could affect that experience in the future such factors include the general economy the overall industry mix of our customer volumes statistical analysis of check fraud trends within our customer volumes and the quality of returned checks once these factors are considered we establish a rate for check losses that is calculated by dividing the expected check losses by dollar volume processed and a rate for anticipated recoveries that is calculated by dividing the anticipated recoveries by the total amount of related check losses these rates are then applied against the dollar volume processed and check losses respectively each month and charged to costs of revenues the estimated check returns and recovery amounts are subject to risk that actual amounts returned and recovered may be different than our estimates we had accrued claims payable and accrued claims recoverable balances of 274 million and 394 million at december 31 2007 and 300 million and 394 million at december 31 2006 respectively 

 

historically such estimation processes have proven to be materially accurate however our projections of probable check guarantee losses and anticipated recoveries are inherently uncertain and as a result we cannot predict with certainty the amount of such items changes in economic conditions the risk characteristics and composition of our customers and other factors could impact our actual and projected amounts we recorded check guarantee losses net of anticipated recoveries excluding service fees of 1138 million and 1029 million respectively for the years ended december 31 2007 and 2006 a ten percent difference in our estimated gross check guarantee losses and our estimated recoveries as of december 31 2007 could impact 2007 net earnings by approximately 45 million aftertax 

 

computer software 

 

computer software includes the fair value of software acquired in business combinations purchased software and capitalized software development costs as of december 31 2007 and 2006 computer software net of accumulated amortization was 7807 million and 6408 million respectively purchased software is recorded at cost and amortized using the straight line method over its estimated useful life and software acquired in business combinations is recorded at its fair value and amortized using straight line and accelerated methods over their estimated useful lives ranging from 3 to 10 years in determining useful lives management considers historical results and technological trends which may influence the estimate amortization expense for computer software 

was 1778 million 1302 million and 917 million in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively we also assess the recorded value of computer software for impairment on a regular basis by comparing the carrying value to the estimated future cash flows to be generated by the underlying software asset there are inherent uncertainties in determining the expected useful life or cash flows to be generated from computer software however we have not historically experienced significant changes in these estimates but could be subject such changes in the future 

 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

 

we have significant intangible assets that were acquired through business acquisitions these assets consist of purchased customer relationships contracts and the excess of purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired goodwill 

 

as of december 31 2007 and 2006 goodwill was 53 billion and 37 billion respectively the process of determining whether or not an asset such as goodwill is impaired or recoverable relies on projections of future cash flows operating results and market conditions such projections are inherently uncertain and accordingly actual future cash flows may differ materially from projected cash flows in evaluating the recoverability of goodwill we perform an annual goodwill impairment test on our reporting units based on an analysis of the discounted future net cash flows generated by the reporting units’ underlying assets such analyses are particularly sensitive to changes in future business trends and economic conditions which can significantly influence our estimates of future net cash flows and discount rates changes to these estimates might result in material changes in the fair value of the reporting units and determination of the recoverability of goodwill potentially leading to charges against earnings and a reduction in the carrying value of our goodwill 

 

as of december 31 2007 and 2006 intangible assets net of accumulated amortization were 10 billion and consisted primarily of purchased customer relationships and trademarks the valuation of these assets involves significant estimates and assumptions concerning matters such as customer retention future cash flows and discount rates if any of these assumptions change it could affect the recoverability of the carrying value of these assets purchased customer relationships are amortized over their estimated useful lives using an accelerated method which takes into consideration expected customer attrition rates over a tenyear period all intangible assets that have been determined to have indefinite lives are not amortized but are reviewed for impairment at least annually in accordance with sfas no 142 during 2005 we recorded a pretax impairment charge of 93 million to writeoff the carrying value of customer relationships which were terminated at one subsidiary in the lps segment the determination of estimated useful lives and the allocation of the purchase price to the fair values of the intangible assets require significant judgment and may affect the amount of future amortization on the intangible assets other than goodwill amortization expense for intangible assets other than goodwill was 1687 million 1756 million and 1254 million in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively there is an inherent uncertainty in determining the expected useful life or cash flows to be generated from intangible assets we have not historically experienced significant changes in these estimates but could be subject to them in the future 

 

accounting for income taxes 

 

as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements we are required to determine income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate this process involves estimating actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing recognition of items for income tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred income tax assets and liabilities which are included within the consolidated balance sheets we must then assess the likelihood that deferred income tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely establish a valuation allowance to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period we must reflect this increase as an expense within income tax expense in the statement of earnings determination of the income tax expense requires estimates and can involve complex issues that may require an extended period to resolve further changes in the geographic mix of revenues or in the estimated level of annual pretax income can cause the overall effective income tax rate to vary from period to period we believe that our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that we adequately provide for any known tax contingencies we believe the estimates and assumptions used to support our evaluation of tax benefit realization are reasonable however final determination of prioryear tax liabilities either by settlement with tax authorities or expiration of statutes of limitations could be materially 

different than estimates reflected in assets and liabilities and historical income tax provisions the outcome of these final determinations could have a material effect on our income tax provision net income or cash flows in the period that determination is made

recent developments 

 

lender processing services spin off 

 

on october 25 2007 we announced that our board of directors had approved pursuing a plan to spinoff the businesses that currently make up our lps segment into a stand alone publicly traded company which will be known as lender processing services inc “lps inc” as currently contemplated we will contribute the majority of the assets and liabilities of this segment into lps inc in exchange for additional shares of the lps inc common stock and approximately 16 billion principal amount of lps inc debt securities following receipt of necessary approvals from the securities and exchange commission the “sec” and a ruling from the internal revenue service the “irs” and an opinion from our special tax advisor with respect to the taxfree nature of the spinoff we will distribute 100 of the lps inc common stock to our shareholders in the spinoff and exchange the lps inc debt securities for a like amount of our existing debt we expect that the spinoff will be taxfree to fis and our shareholders and that the debtfordebt exchange will be taxfree to fis we will then retire the debt that is exchanged for the lps inc debt securities completion of the spinoff is expected to occur in mid2008 fis’s current chief financial officer jeff carbiener is expected to be the chief executive officer of lps inc 

 

in january 2008 we filed a ruling request with the irs regarding the taxfree nature of the lps inc spinoff and intend to file a preliminary form 10 registration statement with the sec in the first quarter of 2008 completion of the spinoff is contingent upon the satisfaction or waiver of a variety of conditions including final approval of the spinoff and all related arrangements by our board of directors the completion of the proposed 

spinoff is also subject to risks and uncertainties including but not limited to those associated with our ability to contribute the lps segment assets and liabilities to lps inc with the ability of lps inc to complete the debt exchange in the manner and on the terms currently contemplated the possibility that necessary governmental approvals or actions from the irs the sec or other authorities will not be obtained and market conditions for the spinoff 

 

evaluation of check services business

factors affecting comparability 

 

our consolidated and combined financial statements included in this report that present our financial condition and operating results reflect the following significant transactions 

 

  

although the legal entity that survived the certegy merger was certegy which has since been renamed fidelity national information services inc for accounting purposes our historical financial statements are those of fis our consolidated and combined financial statements include the results of operations of certegy from the date of the acquisition as a result of this transaction the results of operations in the periods covered by the consolidated and combined financial statements may not be directly comparable

processing and services revenues 

 

processing and services revenues totaled 47580 million 40422 million and 26882 million in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively the increase in revenue in 2007 of 7158 million or 177 as compared to 2006 is primarily attributable to organic growth across both segments as well as increases attributable to acquisitions and newly formed operations the efunds acquisition contributed 1666 million in the tps segment from its september 12 2007 completion date through december 31 2007 and the certegy merger contributed one 

additional month of revenue in the current year or approximately 964 million as compared to the full year 2006 the additional growth in the tps segment was attributable to increased sales to new customers particularly in our international operations our new brazilian outsourcing operation added 405 million to the increase in the current year the growth in the lps segment was primarily the result of increased demand for services due to market share gains and the current real estate market conditions within our default management and appraisal businesses partially offset by decreased demand for other real estate related businesses decreased related party activity with fnf and by the deconsolidation of fidelity national real estate solutions inc “fnres” in the current year the increase in revenue in 2006 of 13539 million as compared to 2005 is primarily due to incremental revenues from the february 1 2006 certegy merger which contributed 10672 million to the overall increase the remaining 2006 increase is attributable to growth across both segments including 152 growth in tps excluding the impact of certegy and 67 growth in lps the growth in tps was driven by strong new sales within integrated financial solutions and international while the growth in lps was driven by market share gains in default and appraisal services 

 

cost of revenues 

 

cost of revenues totaled 34019 million 28753 million and 17502 million in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively the increase in cost of revenues of 5266 million in 2007 as compared to 2006 is primarily attributable to increased costs associated with increased revenues across both segments and the inclusion of expenses relating to efunds since its acquisition date which totaled 1203 million the impact of the one additional month of certegy in the current year was approximately 760 million the increases were slightly offset by the deconsolidation of fnres in the current year the increase in cost of revenues in 2006 as compared to 2005 of 11251 million was primarily due to incremental cost of revenues from the february 1 2006 certegy merger which contributed 8482 million to the overall increase an increase in depreciation and amortization expense to 3830 million in 2006 from 2525 million in 2005 resulting from additional intangible amortization related to the certegy merger also contributed to the yearoveryear increase 

 

gross profit 

 

gross profit as a percentage of revenues “gross margin” was 285 289 and 349 in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively the slight decrease in gross margin in 2007 as compared to 2006 is primarily due to the lps segment which has had significant growth in slightly lower margin service lines particularly our appraisal services we have also experienced declining margins in our tax and property exchange services due to overall slowing of the real estate market the decrease in gross margin in 2006 as compared to 2005 is primarily due to the february 1 2006 certegy merger because the historical certegy businesses typically have lower margins than those of the historically owned fis businesses incremental intangible amortization expense relating to the certegy merger also contributed to the decrease in gross margin in 2006 

 

selling general and administrative expenses 

 

selling general and administrative expenses totaled 5041 million 4982 million and 4119 million for 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively the increase of 59 million in 2007 as compared to 2006 primarily resulted from the inclusion of 152 million of expenses relating to efunds since its acquisition date as well as one additional month of certegy in the current year these 2007 increases were partially offset by a decrease in stockbased compensation expense and the deconsolidation of fnres in the current year stockbased compensation decreased from 501 million in 2006 to 390 million in 2007 the decrease in stockbased compensation is attributable to the 245 million in expense recorded for the vesting of the fis performancebased options granted in march 2005 for which the performance criteria was met during the first quarter of 2006 and an acceleration charge of 61 million recorded in the fourth quarter relating to the fnf merger other cost reduction targets related to the integration of certegy during the current year have been achieved helping to further offset the additional expense related to efunds and certegy the increase of 863 million in selling general and administrative expenses for 2006 as compared to 2005 primarily relates to incremental selling general and administrative expenses from the february 1 2006 certegy merger which contributed 737 million to the overall increase additionally the increase was partly due to an increase in stock based compensation expense which increased from 204 million during 2005 

to 501 million for 2006 this increase in stockbased compensation is primarily attributable to the 245 million and 61 million in transactionrelated expense described above 

 

research and development costs 

 

research and development costs totaled 1063 million 1056 million and 1135 million for 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively 

 

operating income 

 

operating income totaled 7456 million 5631 million and 4126 million for 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively operating income as a percentage of revenue “operating margin” was 157 139 and 153 for 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively the increase in operating margin for 2007 as compared to 2006 is primarily attributable to the increased revenues and achievement of expense synergies relating to the certegy merger the yearoveryear decrease in operating margin for 2006 is primarily due to incremental intangible asset amortization relating to the certegy merger increased stock based compensation costs and other merger related costs as well as relatively lower gross profit percentage associated with the certegy service lines as noted above 

 

interest expense 

 

interest expense totaled 2283 million 1928 million and 1268 million for 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively the increase in interest expense in 2007 as compared to 2006 is a result of our new debt related to the acquisition of efunds as well as the inclusion of 272 million in writeoffs of capitalized debt issuance costs relating to our prior credit facility the increases are partially offset by the impact of lower interest rates and the lower longterm debt balance through the date of the efunds acquisition the increase in interest expense in 2006 as compared to 2005 primarily relates to an increase in interest rates and higher average borrowings the recapitalization that occurred late in the first quarter of 2005 resulted in a full year of interest in 2006 as compared to approximately ten months in 2005 

 

income tax expense 

 

income tax expense totaled 3005 million 1392 million and 1071 million for 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively this resulted in an effective tax rate on continuing operations of 370 372 and 372 for 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively the increase in tax expense for 2007 as compared to 2006 is attributable to increased operating income and the gain on sale of covansys common stock and warrants the decrease in the overall effective tax rate for 2007 is due to the increase in foreign pretax income which is taxed at overall lower rates 

 

net earnings 

 

net earnings from continuing operations totaled 5105 million 2409 million and 1813 for 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively or 260 127 and 141 per diluted share respectively included in net earnings in 2007 is an after tax gain of 1729 million or 088 per diluted share from the sale of covansys common stock and warrants net earnings from discontinued operations including the gain on disposition of property insight were 508 million 181 million and 152 million for the years ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively and diluted earnings per share from discontinued operations totaled 026 010 and 012 for the years ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively

selling general and administrative expenses for the lps segment totaled 1889 million 1974 million and 2240 million for 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively the decrease of 85 million in 2007 as compared to 2006 as well as the decrease of 265 million in 2006 as compared to 2005 was primarily the result of cost control measures and the increased revenue base in the tps segment for allocating certain combined selling and administrative expenses the decrease in 2007 as compared to 2006 is also related to the deconsolidation of fnres partially offset by increased headcount in the default management businesses and increased overhead costs 

 

research and development costs for the lps segment totaled 359 million 347 million and 278 million for 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively

based compensation primarily related to the 245 million in expense recorded in the first quarter of 2006 for the vesting of the fis performance based options granted in march of 2005 for which the performance criteria were met during 2006 and a 61 million charge related to the acceleration of vesting of stock options recorded in the fourth quarter relating to the fnf merger

financing 

 

on january 18 2007 we entered into a credit agreement with jpmorgan chase bank na as administrative agent swing line lender and letter of credit issuer bank of america na as swing line lender and other financial institutions party thereto the “credit agreement” the credit agreement replaced our prior term loans and revolver as well as a 100 million settlement facility as a result of the new credit agreement we repaid the old credit agreement and recorded a charge of 272 million to writeoff unamortized capitalized debt issuance costs the credit agreement which became secured as of september 12 2007 provides for a committed 21 billion fiveyear term facility denominated in us dollars the “term loan a” and a committed 900 million revolving credit 

facility the “revolving loan” with a sublimit of 250 million for letters of credit and a sublimit of 250 million for swing line loans maturing on the fifth anniversary of the closing date the “maturity date” the revolving loan is bifurcated into a 735 million multicurrency revolving credit loan the “multicurrency tranche” that can be denominated in any combination of us dollars euro british pounds sterling and australian dollars and any other foreign currency in which the relevant lenders agree to make advances and a 165 million us dollar revolving credit loan that can be denominated only in us dollars the swingline loans and letters of credit are available as a sublimit under the multicurrency tranche in addition the credit agreement originally provided for an uncommitted incremental loan facility in the maximum principal amount of 600 million which would be made available only upon receipt of further commitments from lenders under the credit agreement sufficient to fund the amount requested by us on july 30 2007 we along with the requisite lenders executed an amendment to the existing credit agreement to facilitate our acquisition of efunds the amendment permitted the issuance of up to 21 billion in additional loans an increase from the foregoing 600 million the amendment became effective september 12 2007 on september 12 2007 we entered into a joinder agreement to obtain a secured 16 billion tranche of term loans denominated in us dollars the “term loan b” under the credit agreement utilizing 16 billion of the 21 billion uncommitted incremental loan amount the term loan b proceeds were used to finance the efunds acquisition and pay related fees and expenses the term loan b will mature on january 18 2014 debt issuance costs of 259 million are capitalized at december 31 2007 and will be amortized over the life of the agreement 

 

as of december 31 2007 the term loan a balance was 20475 million the term loan b balance was 15960 million and a total of 3080 million was outstanding under the revolving loan the obligations under the credit agreement have been jointly and severally unconditionally guaranteed by certain of our domestic subsidiaries additionally we and certain subsidiary guarantors other than efunds pledged certain equity interests we and they held in other entities including certain of our direct and indirect subsidiaries as collateral security for the obligations under the credit facility and the guarantee the pledge also serves to equally and ratably secure our obligations under our outstanding 475 notes due 2008 discussed below 

 

we may borrow repay and reborrow amounts under the revolving loan from time to time until the maturity of the revolving loan we must make quarterly principal payments under the term loan a in scheduled installments of a 131 million per quarter from june 30 2007 through december 31 2008 b 263 million per quarter from march 31 2009 through december 31 2009 and c 525 million per quarter from march 31 2010 through september 30 2011 with the remaining balance of approximately 15 billion payable on the maturity date we must make quarterly principal payments under the term loan b in scheduled installments of 40 million per quarter from december 31 2007 through september 30 2013 with the remaining balance of approximately 15 billion payable on january 18 2014 as discussed above we expect to exchange lps inc debt securities we will receive in connection with the lps inc spinoff for our outstanding term loan b which will immediately thereafter be retired 

 

in addition to the scheduled principal payments the term loans are with certain exceptions subject to mandatory prepayment upon issuances of debt casualty and condemnation events and sales of assets as well as from a percentage of excess cash flow as defined in the credit agreement between zero and fifty percent commencing with the cash flow for the year ended december 31 2008 voluntary prepayments of the loans are generally permitted at any time without fee upon proper notice and subject to a minimum dollar requirement commitment reductions of the revolving loan are also permitted at any time without fee upon proper notice the revolving loan has no scheduled principal payments but it will be due and payable in full on the maturity date 

 

the outstanding balance of the loans bears interest at a floating rate which is an applicable margin plus at our option either a the eurocurrency libor rate or b either i the federal funds rate or ii the prime rate the applicable margin is subject to adjustment based on a leverage ratio our total indebtedness to our ebitda in our consolidated subsidiaries as further defined in the credit agreement alternatively we have the ability to request the lenders to submit competitive bids for one or more advances under the revolving loan 

 

the credit agreement contains affirmative negative and financial covenants customary for financings of this type including among other things limits on the creation of liens limits on the incurrence of indebtedness restrictions on investments and dispositions a prohibition on the payment of dividends and other restricted 

payments if an event of default has occurred and is continuing or would result therefrom a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum leverage ratio upon an event of default the administrative agent can accelerate the maturity of the loan events of default include conditions customary for such an agreement including failure to pay principal and interest in a timely manner and breach of certain covenants these events of default include a crossdefault provision that permits the lenders to declare the credit agreement in default if i we fail to make any payment after the applicable grace period under any indebtedness with a principal amount in excess of 150 million or ii we fail to perform any other term under any such indebtedness as a result of which the holders thereof may cause it to become due and payable prior to its maturity we were in compliance with all covenants related to the credit agreement at december 31 2007 

 

both the credit agreement and the 475 notes referred to below are equally and ratably secured by a pledge of equity interests in our subsidiaries subject to certain exceptions for subsidiaries not required to be pledged as of december 31 2007 the shares of subsidiaries representing less than 10 of our net assets were subject to such pledge 

 

through the certegy merger we have an obligation to service 2000 million aggregate principal amount of secured 475 fixedrate notes due in 2008 the notes were recorded in purchase accounting at a discount of 57 million which is being amortized over the term of the notes the notes accrue interest at a rate of 475 per year payable semiannually in arrears on each march 15 and september 15 the notes include customary events of default including a crossdefault provision that permits the trustee or the holders of at least 25 of the notes to declare the notes in default if i we fail to make any payment after the applicable grace period under any indebtedness with a principal amount in excess of 10 million or ii we fail to perform any other term under any such indebtedness as a result of which the holders thereof have caused it to become due and payable prior to its maturity 

 

through the efunds acquisition on september 12 2007 we assumed 1000 million in longterm notes payable previously issued to efunds the “efunds notes” subsequent to yearend we redeemed the efunds notes for a total of 1093 million which includes a makewhole premium of 93 million we completed the redemption on february 26 2008 

 

we have entered into the following interest rate swap transactions converting a portion of the interest rate exposure on our term loans from variable to fixed in millions 

 

 

 

 

  

we have designated these interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges in accordance with sfas no 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  the estimated fair value of these cash flow hedges results in a liability of 412 million and an asset of 49 million as of december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively which is included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets in other noncurrent assets or liabilities and as a component of accumulated other comprehensive earnings net of deferred taxes a portion of the amount included in accumulated other comprehensive earnings is reclassified into interest expense as a yield adjustment as interest payments are made on the term loans 

our existing cash flow hedges are highly effective and there is no current impact on earnings due to hedge ineffectiveness it is our policy to execute such instruments with creditworthy banks and not to enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes

our primary competitors include internal technology departments within banks data processing or software development departments of large companies or large computer manufacturers thirdparty payment processors independent computer services firms companies that develop and deploy software applications companies that provide customized development implementation and support services and companies that market software for the electronic payment industry some of these competitors possess substantially greater financial sales and marketing 

resources than we do competitive factors for applications and services include the quality of the technologybased application or service application features and functions ease of delivery and integration ability of the provider to maintain enhance and support the applications or services and price we believe that we compete favorably in each of these categories in addition we believe that our financial institution industry expertise combined with our ability to offer multiple applications and services to individual customers enhances our competitiveness against competitors with more limited application offerings 

 

we compete with vendors that offer similar core processing applications and services to financial institutions including fiserv inc jack henry and associates inc metavante corporation open solutions ibm and accenture in certain nonus markets we compete with regional providers including alnova iflex and temenos 

 

our competitors in the card issuer services market include thirdparty credit and debit card processors such as first data corporation total system services electronic data systems corporation and payment systems for credit unions and thirdparty software providers which license their card processing systems to financial institutions and thirdparty processors competitors in the check risk management services market include first data’s telecheck services division crosscheck efunds and global payments 

 

the markets for our mortgage information services are also highly competitive key competitive factors include quality of the service convenience speed of delivery customer service and price we do not believe that there is a competitor currently offering the scope of services and market coverage that we provide in our mortgage information services business however there are a number of competitors in specific lines some of which have substantial resources first american and land america are significant competitors in a majority of our mortgage information services including tax flood appraisal and default 

 

research and development 

 

our research and development activities have related primarily to the design and development of our processing systems and related software applications and risk management platforms we expect to continue our practice of investing an appropriate level of resources to maintain enhance and extend the functionality of our proprietary systems and existing software applications to develop new and innovative software applications and systems in response to the needs of our customers and to enhance the capabilities surrounding our outsourcing infrastructure in addition we intend to offer products and services that are compatible with new and emerging delivery channels 

 

as part of our research and development process we evaluate current and emerging technology for applicability to our existing and future software platforms to this end we engage with various hardware and software vendors in evaluation of various infrastructure components where appropriate we use thirdparty technology components in the development of our software applications and service offerings thirdparty software may be used for highly specialized business functions which we may not be able to develop internally within time and budget constraints additionally thirdparty software may be used for commodity type functions within a technology platform environment in the case of nearly all of our thirdparty software enterprise license agreements exist for the thirdparty component and either alternative suppliers exist or transfer rights exist to ensure the continuity of supply as a result we are not materially dependent upon any thirdparty technology components we work with our customers to determine the appropriate timing and approach to introducing technology or infrastructure changes to our applications and services in the years ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 we recorded expense of approximately 1056 million 1135 million and 742 million respectively on research and development efforts 

 

with respect to our outsourcing of software development we are transferring costs from our us and western europeanbased development centers to covansys corporation covansys in which fis holds an equity investment and other lower cost offshore facilities we are using our relationship with covansys and with other facilities to lower our internal development costs over time by outsourcing certain programming development and maintenance functions 

 

government regulation 

 

various aspects of our businesses are subject to federal state and foreign regulation our failure to comply with any applicable laws and regulations could result in restrictions on our ability to provide our products and services as well as the imposition of civil fines and criminal penalties 

 

as a provider of electronic data processing and backoffice services to financial institutions such as banks thrifts and credit unions we are subject to regulatory oversight and examination by the federal financial institutions examination council an interagency body of the federal deposit insurance corporation the office of thrift supervision the office of the comptroller of the currency the board of governors of the federal reserve system the national credit union administration and various state regulatory authorities in addition independent auditors annually review several of our operations to provide reports on internal controls for our customers’ auditors and regulators we also may be subject to possible review by state agencies that regulate banks in each state in which we conduct our electronic processing activities 

 

beginning july 1 2001 financial institutions were required to comply with privacy regulations imposed under the grammleachbliley act these regulations place restrictions on financial institutions’ use of nonpublic personal information all financial institutions must disclose detailed privacy policies to their customers and offer them the opportunity to direct the financial institution not to share information with third parties the new regulations however permit financial institutions to share information with nonaffiliated parties who perform services for the financial institutions as a provider of services to financial institutions we are required to comply with the privacy regulations and are bound by the same limitations on disclosure of the information received from our customers as apply to the financial institutions themselves 

 

given that one of the databases that we maintain in the us contains certain data pertaining to the checkwriting histories of consumers and that data is used to provide certain check risk management services our check risk management business is subject to the federal fair credit reporting act and various similar state laws among other things the fair credit reporting act imposes requirements on us concerning data accuracy and provides that consumers have the right to know the contents of their checkwriting histories to dispute their accuracy and to require verification or removal of disputed information in furtherance of our objectives of data accuracy fair treatment of consumers protection of consumers’ personal information and compliance with these laws we maintain a high level of security for our computer systems in which consumer data resides and we maintain consumer relations call centers to facilitate efficient handling of consumer requests for information and handling of disputes 

 

our check collection services are subject to the federal fair debt collection practices act and various state collection laws and licensing requirements the federal trade commission as well as state attorneys general and other agencies have enforcement responsibility over the collection laws as well as the various credit reporting laws 

 

elements of our cash access business are registered as a money services business and are subject to the usa patriot act and reporting requirements of the bank secrecy act and us treasury regulations this business is also subject to various state local and tribal licensing requirements the financial crimes enforcement network state attorneys general and other agencies have enforcement responsibility over laws relating to money laundering currency transmission and licensing 

 

the real estate settlement procedures act or respa and related regulations generally prohibit the payment or receipt of fees or any other item of value for the referral of a real estatesecured loan to a loan broker or lender and prohibit fee shares or splits or unearned fees in connection with the provision of residential real estate settlement services such as mortgage brokerage and real estate brokerage notwithstanding these prohibitions respa permits payments for goods furnished or for services actually performed so long as those payments bear a reasonable relationship to the market value of the goods or services provided respa and related regulations may to some extent restrict our real estaterelated businesses from entering into certain preferred alliance arrangements the us department of housing and urban development is responsible for enforcing respa 

 

real estate appraisers are subject to regulation in most states and some state appraisal boards have sought to prohibit our automated valuation applications courts have limited such prohibitions in part on the ground of 

preemption by the federal financial institutions reform recovery and enforcement act of 1989 but we cannot assure you that our valuation and appraisal services business will not be subject to regulation 

 

the title agency and related services we provide are conducted through an underwritten title company title agencies and individual escrow officers the regulation of an underwritten title company in california is generally limited to requirements to maintain specified levels of net worth and working capital and to obtain and maintain a license in each of the counties in california in which it operates the title agencies and individual escrow officers are also subject to regulation by the insurance or banking regulators in many jurisdictions these regulators generally require among other items that agents and individuals obtain and maintain a license and be appointed by a title insurer we also own a small title insurer which issues policies generated by our agency operations in relatively limited circumstances this insurer is domiciled in new york and is therefore subject to regulation by the insurance regulatory authorities of that state among other things no person may acquire 10 or more of our common stock without the approval of the new york insurance regulators 

 

the california department of insurance has recently proposed implementing rate reductions in the title insurance industry in california new york colorado florida nevada texas and other insurance regulators have also announced reviews of title insurance rates and other states could follow at this stage we are unable to predict what the outcome will be of these or any similar processes 

 

given that we conduct business in international markets as well as in the us we are subject to laws and regulations in jurisdictions outside the us that regulate many of the same activities that are described above including electronic data processing and backoffice services for financial institutions and use of consumer information 

 

the irs has proposed regulations under section 468b regarding the taxation of the income earned on escrow accounts trusts and other funds used during deferred exchanges of likekind property and under section 7872 regarding belowmarket loans to facilitators of these exchanges the proposed regulations affect taxpayers that engage in likekind exchanges and escrow holders trustees qualified intermediaries and others that hold funds during likekind exchanges we currently do not know what effect these changes will have on our 1031 exchange businesses 

 

although we do not believe that compliance with future laws and regulations related to our businesses including future consumer protection laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on our company enactment of new laws and regulations may increasingly affect the operations of our business directly or indirectly which could result in substantial regulatory compliance costs litigation expense adverse publicity andor loss of revenue 

 

employees 

 

as of december 31 2006 we had approximately 24871 employees including approximately 7706 employees principally employed outside of the us none of our us workforce currently is unionized we have not experienced any work stoppages and we consider our relations with employees to be good

 item 1a   risk factors tableend  

in addition to the normal risks of business we are subject to significant risks and uncertainties including those listed below and others described elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k any of the risks described herein could result in a significant adverse effect on our results of operation and financial condition 

 

if we fail to adapt our services to changes in technology or in the marketplace or if our ongoing efforts to upgrade our technology are not successful we could lose customers and have difficulty attracting new customers for our products and services 

 

the markets for our services are characterized by constant technological changes frequent introductions of new services and evolving industry standards our future success will be significantly affected by our ability to enhance our current products and services and develop and introduce new products and services that address the increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers and their clients these initiatives carry the risks associated with any new product or service development effort including cost overruns delays in delivery and performance issues there can be no assurance that we will be successful in developing marketing and selling new products and services that meet these changing demands that we will not experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development introduction and marketing of these products and services or that our new products and services and their enhancements will adequately meet the demands of the marketplace and achieve market acceptance 

 

we operate in a competitive business environment and if we are unable to compete effectively our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 

 

the market for our services is intensely competitive our competitors vary in size and in the scope and breadth of the services they offer some of our competitors have substantial resources we face direct competition from third parties and since many of our larger potential customers have historically developed their key applications inhouse and therefore view their system requirements from a makeversusbuy perspective we often compete against our potential customers’ inhouse capacities in addition we expect that the markets in which we compete will continue to attract new competitors and new technologies there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors or that competitive pressures we face in the markets in which we operate will not materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

our substantial leverage and debt service requirements may adversely affect our financial and operational flexibility 

 

as of december 31 2006 we had total debt of approximately 30 billion this high level of debt could have important consequences to us including the following 

 

  

in addition the terms of our senior credit facilities may restrict us from taking actions such as making significant acquisitions or dispositions or entering into certain agreements that we might believe to be advantageous to us 

 

if we are unable to successfully consummate and integrate acquisitions our results of operations may be adversely affected 

 

as part of our growth strategy we have made numerous acquisitions in recent years we anticipate that we will continue to seek to acquire complementary businesses products and services this strategy will depend on the ability to find suitable acquisitions and finance them on acceptable terms we may require additional debt or equity financing for future acquisitions and doing so will be made more difficult by our substantial debt if we are unable to acquire suitable acquisition candidates we may experience slower growth 

 

further even if we successfully complete acquisitions we will face challenges in integrating any acquired business these challenges include eliminating redundant operations facilities and systems coordinating management and personnel retaining key employees managing different corporate cultures and achieving cost reductions and crossselling opportunities there can be no assurance that we will be able to fully integrate all aspects of acquired businesses successfully or fully realize the potential benefits of bringing them together and the process of integrating these acquisitions may disrupt our business and divert our resources 

 

consolidation in the banking and financial services industry could adversely affect our revenues by eliminating some of our existing and potential customers and could make us more dependent on a more limited number of customers 

 

there has been and continues to be substantial merger acquisition and consolidation activity in the banking and financial services industry mergers or consolidations of banks and financial institutions in the future could reduce the number of our customers and potential customers which could adversely affect our revenues even if these events do not reduce the aggregate number of customers or the banking and other activities of the consolidated entities if our customers merge with or are acquired by other entities that are not our customers or that use fewer of our services they may discontinue or reduce their use of our services in addition it is possible that the larger banks or financial institutions resulting from mergers or consolidations could decide to perform inhouse some or all of the services which we currently provide or could provide any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

 

demand for many of our products and services is sensitive to the level of consumer transactions generated by our customers and accordingly our revenues could be impacted negatively by a general economic slowdown or any other event causing a material slowing of consumer spending 

 

a significant portion of our revenue is derived from transaction processing fees any changes in economic factors that adversely affect consumer spending and related consumer debt or a reduction in check writing or credit and debit card usage could reduce the volume of transactions that we process and have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

potential customers of our financial information software and services business may be reluctant to switch to a new vendor which may adversely affect our growth both in the us and internationally 

 

for banks and other potential customers of our financial information software and services segment switching from one vendor of bank core processing or related software and services or from an internallydeveloped system to a new vendor is a significant undertaking many potential customers worry about potential disadvantages such as loss of accustomed functionality increased costs and business disruption as a result potential customers both in the us and internationally often resist change we seek to overcome this resistance through strategies such as making investments to enhance the functionality of our software however there can be no assurance that our strategies for overcoming potential customers’ reluctance to change vendors will be successful and this resistance may adversely affect our growth both in the us and internationally 

 

decreased lending and real estate activity may reduce demand for certain of our services and adversely affect our results of operations 

 

revenues from our information services and lender services operations are closely related to the general level of real estate transactions such as real estate sales and mortgage refinancings real estate sales are affected by a 

number of factors including mortgage interest rates the availability of funds to finance purchases and general economic conditions the volume of refinancing transactions in particular and mortgage originations in general declined in 2004 2005 and 2006 from 2003 levels resulting in reduction of revenues in some of our businesses in addition rising mortgage delinquency and default rates have negatively impacted some of our mortgage lending customers particularly within the subprime lending market these trends appear likely to continue our revenues in future periods will continue to be subject to these and other factors which are beyond our control and as a result are likely to fluctuate 

 

we could have conflicts with fnf and the executive chairman of our board of directors and other officers and directors could have conflicts of interest due to their relationships with fnf 

 

conflicts may arise between fnf and us as a result of our ongoing agreements and the nature of our respective businesses among other things we and certain of our subsidiaries are parties to a variety of intercompany agreements with fnf certain of our executive officers and directors will be subject to conflicts of interest with respect to such intercompany agreements and other matters due to their relationships with fnf 

 

some of the fnf executive officers and directors who became executive officers and directors of our company in connection with the fnf merger including william p foley ii alan l stinson and brent b bickett own substantial amounts of fnf stock and stock options because of their relationships with fnf and old fnf prior to the fnf merger such ownership could create or appear to create potential conflicts of interest when our directors and officers are faced with decisions that involve fnf or any of its respective subsidiaries 

 

mr foley who became our executive chairman in connection with the fnf merger is currently the chief executive officer and chairman of the board of directors of fnf mr stinson and mr bickett also became officers of our company and fnf as a result each of these individuals has obligations to us as well as to fnf and will have conflicts of interest with respect to matters potentially or actually involving or affecting us and fnf 

 

matters that could give rise to conflicts between us and fnf include among other things 

 

  

we will seek to manage these potential conflicts through dispute resolution and other provisions of our agreements with fnf and through oversight by independent members of our board of directors however there can be no assurance that such measures will be effective or that we will be able to resolve all potential conflicts with fnf or that the resolution of any such conflicts will be no less favorable to us than if we were dealing with an unaffiliated third party 

 

we may lack adequate oversight since the chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer of fnf is also our executive chairman 

 

mr foley is executive chairman of our board of directors mr foley is also the chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer of fnf as a result of his roles he has obligations to us as well as fnf and may have conflicts of time with respect to matters potentially or actually involving or affecting us as executive chairman it is expected that mr foley will devote no more than onehalf of his time to matters relating to us if mr foley’s duties as executive chairman of our board of directors require more time than he is able to allot then his oversight of the activities of our company could be diminished and the effective management of our company could be adversely affected 

 

our revenues from the sale of services to visa and mastercard organizations are dependent upon our continued visa and mastercard certification and financial institution sponsorship and the loss or suspension of this certification or sponsorship could adversely affect our business 

 

in order to provide our card services we must be designated a certified processor by and be a member service provider of mastercard and be designated as an independent sales organization of visa these designations are dependent upon our continuing adherence to the standards of the visa and mastercard associations the member financial institutions of visa and mastercard some of which are our competitors set the standards with which we must comply if we fail to comply with these standards our designation as a certified processor as a member service provider or as an independent sales organization could be suspended or terminated the termination of our member service provider status or our status as a certified processor or any changes in the visa and mastercard rules that prevent our registration or otherwise limit our ability to provide transaction processing and marketing services for the visa or mastercard organizations would result in the loss of business from visa or mastercard issuing customers and lead to a reduction in our revenues which would have a material adverse effect on our business 

 

we have a long sales cycle for many of our applications and if we fail to close sales after expending significant time and resources to do so our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 

 

the implementation of many of our applications often involves significant capital commitments by our customers particularly those with smaller operational scale potential customers generally commit significant resources to an evaluation of available software and require us to expend substantial time effort and money educating them as to the value of our software and services we incur substantial costs in order to obtain each new customer we may expend significant funds and management resources during the sales cycle and ultimately fail to close the sale our sales cycle may be extended due to our customers’ budgetary constraints or for other reasons if we are unsuccessful in closing sales after expending significant funds and management resources or we experience delays it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

if old fnf’s 2006 spinoff of fnf does not constitute a tax free distribution under section 355e of the internal revenue code or if our merger with old fnf does not constitute a tax free reorganization under section 368a then we may suffer losses resulting from payment of taxes and taxrelated losses 

 

under a tax disaffiliation agreement which we were required to enter into with old fnf and fnf as a condition to the closing under our merger agreement with old fnf fnf is required to indemnify us for taxes and taxrelated losses including stockholder suits if old fnf’s 2006 spinoff of fnf the “2006 distribution” were determined to be taxable either to old fnf and us as its successor or the fnf stockholders or both unless such adverse determination were the result of a breach by us of our agreement not to take any action within our control that would cause the 2006 distribution to be taxable or the result of an acquisition of fis stock within the control of us or a subsidiary in such an event old fnf estimated that the amount of tax on the transfer of fnf’s stock in the distribution could be in the range of 150 million and possibly greater depending on among other things the value of fnf’s stock at the time of the 2006 distribution in addition fnf is required under the tax disaffiliation agreement to indemnify old fnf and us as its successor for taxes and taxrelated losses including stockholder suits in the event the old fnffis merger were determined to be taxable old fnf estimated that the amount of tax on old fnf’s transfer and retirement of its fis stock in the merger could be in the range of 1 billion and possibly greater depending on among other things the value of our stock at the time of the merger 

 

even if the 2006 distribution otherwise qualifies as a spinoff under section 355 of the code the distribution of fnf common stock to the old fnf stockholders in connection with the 2006 distribution would not qualify as taxfree to old fnf or us as its successor under section 355e of the code if 50 or more of the stock of old fnf including us as successor to old fnf or fnf is acquired as part of a plan or series of related transactions that includes the 2006 distribution as a result of our merger with old fnf approximately 49 of our stock would be treated as having been acquired pursuant to a plan that includes the 2006 distribution for purposes of section 355e of the code 

there is no guaranty that fnf will have financial resources to satisfy any such indemnification obligation described above if the taxfree status is lost because of any action taken by us or any of our subsidiaries after the time of the 2006 distribution except for certain actions specifically identified in the tax disaffiliation agreement we would be required to pay the taxes described above ourself and would be required to indemnify fnf for all taxrelated losses 

 

we may be affected by significant restrictions following the fnf merger with respect to certain actions that could jeopardize the taxfree status of the spinoff by old fnf of fidelity national title group or the fnf merger 

 

in order to preserve the taxfree treatment of the spinoff by old fnf of fidelity national title group a tax disaffiliation agreement entered into by fnf and us prior to the closing under the fnf merger agreement restricts us for two years after the spinoff from taking certain actions within our control that could cause the spinoff to be taxable without first obtaining a consent of certain officers of fnf or obtaining an opinion from a nationally recognized law firm or accounting firm that such action will not cause the spinoff to be taxable to fnf under section 355e of the code in general such actions would include engaging in certain transactions involving i the acquisition of our stock or ii the issuance of shares of our stock 

 

because of these restrictions we may be limited in the amount of stock that we can issue to make acquisitions or raise additional capital in the two years subsequent to the spinoff and the fnf merger and in our ability to repurchase shares of our common stock 

 

we may experience software defects development delays and installation difficulties which would harm our business and reputation and expose us to potential liability 

 

many of our services are based on sophisticated software and computing systems and we may encounter delays when developing new applications and services further the software underlying our services has occasionally contained and may in the future contain undetected errors or defects when first introduced or when new versions are released in addition we may experience difficulties in installing or integrating our technologies on platforms used by our customers defects in our software errors or delays in the processing of electronic transactions or other difficulties could result in 

 

  

although we attempt to limit our potential liability through disclaimers and limitationofliability provisions in our license and customer agreements we cannot be certain that these measures will be successful in limiting our liability 

 

security breaches or computer viruses could harm our business by disrupting our delivery of services and damaging our reputation 

 

as part of our business we electronically receive process store and transmit sensitive business information of our customers in addition we collect personal consumer data such as names and addresses social security numbers driver’s license numbers checking and savings account numbers and payment history records unauthorized access to our computer systems or databases could result in the theft or publication of confidential information or the deletion or modification of records or could otherwise cause interruptions in our operations these concerns about security are increased when we transmit information over the internet computer viruses have 

also been distributed and have rapidly spread over the internet computer viruses could infiltrate our systems disrupting our delivery of services and making our applications unavailable any inability to prevent security breaches or computer viruses could also cause existing customers to lose confidence in our systems and terminate their agreements with us and could inhibit our ability to attract new customers 

 

many of our customers are subject to a regulatory environment and to industry standards that may change in a manner that reduces the number of transactions in which our customers engage and therefore reduces our revenues 

 

our customers are subject to a number of government regulations and industry standards with which our products and services must comply for example our products are affected by visa and mastercard electronic payment standards that are generally updated twice annually in addition action by regulatory authorities relating to credit availability data usage privacy or other related regulatory developments could have an adverse effect on our customers and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

if we fail to comply with privacy regulations imposed on providers of services to financial institutions our business could be harmed 

 

as a provider of services to financial institutions we are bound by the same limitations on disclosure of the information we receive from our customers as apply to the financial institutions themselves if we fail to comply with these regulations we could be exposed to suits for breach of contract or to governmental proceedings our customer relationships and reputation could be harmed and we could be inhibited in our ability to obtain new customers in addition if more restrictive privacy laws or rules are adopted in the future on the federal or state level or with respect to our international operations by authorities in foreign jurisdictions on the national provincial state or other level that could have an adverse impact on us 

 

if we experience system failures the products and services we provide to our customers could be delayed or interrupted which could harm our business and reputation and result in the loss of customers 

 

our ability to provide reliable service in a number of our businesses depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operations of our computer network systems and data centers our systems and operations could be exposed to damage or interruption from fire natural disaster power loss telecommunications failure unauthorized entry and computer viruses although we have taken steps to prevent system failures we cannot be certain that our measures will be successful further our property and business interruption insurance may not be adequate to compensate us for all losses or failures that may occur any significant interruptions could 

 

  

any one or more of the foregoing occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

we face liability to our merchant customers if checks that we have guaranteed are dishonored by the check writer’s bank 

 

if a check that we have guaranteed is dishonored by the check writer’s bank we must reimburse our merchant customer for the check’s face value and pursue collection of the amount from the delinquent check writer in some cases we recognize a liability to our merchant customers for estimated check returns and a receivable for amounts we estimate we will recover from the check writers based on historical experience and other relevant factors the estimated check returns and recovery amounts are subject to the risk that actual amounts returned may exceed our estimates and actual amounts recovered may be less than our estimates 

 

our outsourcing of key development functions overseas may lead to quality control issues that affect our business operations 

 

by outsourcing development functions overseas we may experience quality control issues in our applications offered to our markets overseas outsourcing operations are subject to risk of quality control deficiencies due to the physical distance from our headquarters the increased potential for instructions and guidance to be misunderstood a lack of direct institutional control and the time and expense it will take to provide on site training any one of these factors make it more difficult for us to maintain quality control and the potential for quality control issues may impact our ability to maintain and or increase our customer base 

 

misappropriation of our intellectual property and proprietary rights could impair our competitive position 

 

our ability to compete depends upon proprietary systems and technology despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our services or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary policing unauthorized use of our proprietary rights is difficult we cannot make any assurances that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of technology or that the agreements entered into for that purpose will be enforceable effective trademark service mark copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our applications and services are made available online misappropriation of our intellectual property or potential litigation concerning such matters could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 

 

if our applications or services are found to infringe the proprietary rights of others we may be required to change our business practices and may also become subject to significant costs and monetary penalties 

 

as our information technology applications and services develop we may become increasingly subject to infringement claims any claims whether with or without merit could 

 

  

we may not succeed with our current and future expansion of our international operations and such failure may adversely affect our growth and results of operations 

 

in 2006 sales outside of the us represented approximately 109 of our revenues we believe there are additional opportunities to expand our international operations and we expect to commit significant resources to expand our international sales and marketing activities however overall we are less wellknown internationally than in the united states and have less experience with local business conditions in addition we will face challenges in successfully managing small operations located far from our headquarters because of the greater difficulty in overseeing and guiding operations from a distance and we will be increasingly subject to a number of other risks and potential costs including 

 

 17 

 

  

there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future international competitors 

 

sales of our shares by large shareholders could adversely affect the trading price of our shares 

 

in connection with the 2005 minority interest sale in former fis we entered into a registration rights agreement with certain of our stockholders requiring us to register the shares of our common stock that are beneficially owned by them consequently we have to date registered for resale from time to time shares which collectively account for approximately 128 of our shares outstanding sales of these shares or the possibility that sales of these shares may occur in unlimited amounts and without prior notice could adversely affect the trading price of our shares

 item 7   management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend  

overview 

 

we are one of the largest global providers of processing services to financial institutions with marketleading positions in core processing card issuing services check risk management mortgage processing and certain other lender processing services in the us serving customers in over 60 countries throughout the world we offer a diversified product mix and we believe that we will continue to benefit from the opportunity to crosssell products and services across our broad customer base and from our expanded international presence and scale we have two reporting segments transaction processing services and lender processing services which produced approximately 59 and 41 respectively of our revenues for the year ended december 31 2006 

 

 24 

  

  

we also have a corporate segment that consists primarily of costs relating to corporate overhead 

 

business trends and conditions 

 

transaction processing services 

 

in the transaction processing services business increases in deposit and card transactions can positively affect our business and thus the condition of the overall economy can have an effect on growth 

 

in this segment we compete for both licensing and outsourcing business and thus are affected by the decisions of financial institutions to utilize our services under an outsourced arrangement or to process inhouse under a software license and maintenance agreement as a provider of outsourcing solutions we benefit from multiyear recurring revenue streams generally financial institutions of all sizes will consider outsourcing information technology and business process services to varying degrees although smaller financial institutions are more likely to outsource all information technology functions to companies such as us since they generally do not have the staff budget or expertise to implement and operate highly complex technical environments larger financial institutions have historically chosen to limit outsourcing to specific application functions or services in connection with a particular product or operation generally demand for outsourcing solutions has increased over time as providers such as us realize economies of scale and improve their ability to provide services that improve customer efficiencies and reduce costs 

 

card transactions continue to increase as a percentage of total pointofsale payments which fuels continuing demand for cardrelated products we continue to launch new products aimed at serving this demand in recent years we have introduced a variety of storedvalue card types internet banking and electronic bill presentmentpayment products as well as a number of card enhancement and loyaltyreward programs the common theme among these offerings continues to be convenience and security for the consumer coupled with value to the financial institution 

 

we may be affected by the consolidation trend in the banking industry this trend may be beneficial or detrimental to the transaction processing services businesses when consolidations occur merger partners often operate disparate systems licensed from competing service providers the newly formed entity generally makes a determination to migrate its core systems to a single platform when a financial institution processing client is involved in a consolidation we may benefit by expanding the use of our services if such services are chosen to survive the consolidation and support the newly combined entity conversely we may lose market share if a customer of ours is involved in a consolidation and our services are not chosen to survive the consolidation and support the newly combined entity 

 

lender processing services 

 

our mortgage processing services business driven by msp is largely subject to the same types of factors as affect our financial institutions core processing business described above the level of residential real estate activity which depends in part on the level of interest rates affects the level of revenues from many of the other businesses in the lender processing services segment 

 

the increase in interest rates in 2006 has resulted in a reduction in new loan origination and refinancing activity the current mba forecast is for 24 trillion of mortgage originations in 2007 as compared to 25 trillion in 2006 relatively higher interest rates are also likely to result in seasonal effects having more influence on real estate activity traditionally the greatest volume of real estate activity particularly residential resale transactions has occurred in the spring and summer months 

 

in contrast we believe that a rising interest rate environment may increase the volume of consumer mortgage defaults and thus favorably affect our default management services which provide services relating to residential mortgage loans in default the overall strength of the economy also affects default revenues 

 

critical accounting policies 

 

the accounting policies described below are those we consider critical in preparing our consolidated and combined financial statements certain of these policies require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures with respect to contingent liabilities and assets at the date of the consolidated and combined financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods actual amounts could differ from those estimates see note 3 of notes to the consolidated and combined financial statements for a more detailed description of the significant accounting policies that have been followed in preparing our consolidated and combined financial statements 

 

revenue recognition 

 

the following describes our primary types of revenues and our revenue recognition policies as they pertain to the types of transactions we enter into with our customers we enter into arrangements with customers to provide services software and software related services such as postcontract customer support and implementation and training either individually or as part of an integrated offering of multiple products and services these products and services occasionally include offerings from more than one segment to the same customer the revenues for services provided under these multiple element arrangements are recognized in accordance with the applicable revenue recognition accounting principles as further described below 

 

in our tps business we recognize revenues relating to bank processing and credit and debit card processing services along with software licensing and software related services several of our contracts include a software license and one or more of the following services data processing development implementation conversion training programming postcontract customer support and application management in some cases these services are offered in combination with one another and in other cases we offer them individually revenues from processing services are typically volumebased depending on factors such as the number of accounts processed transactions processed and computer resources utilized 

 

the substantial majority of the revenues in the transaction processing services business are from outsourced data processing credit and debit card processing and application management arrangements revenues from these arrangements are recognized as services are performed in accordance with securities and exchange commission “sec” staff accounting bulletin no 104 “sab no 104” “revenue recognition” and related interpretations sab no 104 sets forth guidance as to when revenue is realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met 1 persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 2 delivery has occurred or services have been rendered 3 the seller’s price to the buyer is fixed and determinable and 4 collectability is reasonably assured revenues and costs related to implementation conversion and programming services associated with our data processing and application management agreements during the implementation phase are deferred and subsequently recognized using the straightline method over the term of the related services agreement we evaluate these deferred contract costs for impairment in the event any indications of impairment exist a portion of credit card processing revenue is generated from our merchant institution processing business where our relationship is with the financial institution that contracts directly with the merchant in this business we are responsible for collecting and settling interchange fees with the credit card associations thus interchange fees are included as a component of revenue and costs of revenue 

 

in the event that arrangements with our customers include more than one product or service we determine whether the individual revenue elements can be recognized separately in accordance with financial accounting 

standards board “fasb” emerging issues task force no 0021 “eitf 0021” “revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables” eitf 0021 addresses the determination of whether an arrangement involving more than one deliverable contains more than one unit of accounting and how the arrangement consideration should be measured and allocated to the separate units of accounting 

 

if the products and services are software related products and services as determined under aicpa’s sop 972 “software revenue recognition” “sop 972” and sop 989 “modification of sop no 972 software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions” “sop 989” we apply these pronouncements and related interpretations to determine the appropriate units of accounting and how the arrangement consideration should be measured and allocated to the separate units 

 

we recognize software license and postcontract customer support fees as well as associated development implementation training conversion and programming fees in accordance with sop no 972 and sop no 989 initial license fees are recognized when a contract exists the fee is fixed or determinable software delivery has occurred and collection of the receivable is deemed probable provided that vendorspecific objective evidence “vsoe” has been established for each element or for any undelivered elements we determine the fair value of each element or the undelivered elements in multielement software arrangements based on vsoe if the arrangement is subject to accounting under sop no 972 vsoe for each element is based on the price charged when the same element is sold separately or in the case of postcontract customer support when a stated renewal rate is provided to the customer if evidence of fair value of all undelivered elements exists but evidence does not exist for one or more delivered elements then revenue is recognized using the residual method under the residual method the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is recognized as revenue if evidence of fair value does not exist for one or more undelivered elements of a contract then all revenue is deferred until all elements are delivered or fair value is determined for all remaining undelivered elements revenue from postcontract customer support is recognized ratably over the term of the agreement we record deferred revenue for all billings invoiced prior to revenue recognition 

 

with respect to a small percentage of revenues we use contract accounting as required by sop no 972 when the arrangement with the customer includes significant customization modification or production of software for elements accounted for under contract accounting revenue is recognized in accordance with sop 811 “accounting for performance of construction type and certain productiontype contracts” using the percentageofcompletion method since reasonably dependable estimates of revenues and contract hours applicable to various elements of a contract can be made revenues in excess of billings on these agreements are recorded as unbilled receivables and are included in trade receivables billings in excess of revenue recognized on these agreements are recorded as deferred revenue until revenue recognition criteria are met changes in estimates for revenues costs and profits are recognized in the period in which they are determinable when our estimates indicate that the entire contract will be performed at a loss a provision for the entire loss is recorded in that accounting period 

 

in our lps business we recognize revenues relating to mortgage processing services loan facilitation services default management services and property datarelated services mortgage processing arrangements are typically volumebased depending on factors such as the number of accounts processed transactions processed and computer resources utilized revenue derived from software and service arrangements included in the lender processing services segment is recognized in accordance with sop no 972 as discussed above loan facilitation services primarily consist of centralized title agency and closing services for various types of lenders revenues relating to loan facilitation services are typically recognized at the time of closing of the related real estate transaction ancillary service fees are recognized when the service is provided default management services assist customers through the default and foreclosure process including property preservation and maintenance services such as lock changes window replacement debris removal and lawn service posting and publication of foreclosure and auction notices title searches document preparation and recording services and referrals for legal and property brokerage services property data or datarelated services principally include appraisal and valuation services property records information real estate tax services borrower credit and flood zone information and multiple listing software and services revenues derived from these services are recognized as the services are performed in accordance with sab no 104 as described above 

 

in addition our flood and tax units provide various services including lifeofloanmonitoring services revenue for lifeofloan services is deferred and recognized ratably over the estimated average life of the loan service period which is determined based on our historical experience and industry data we evaluate our historical experience on a periodic basis and adjust the estimated life of the loan service period prospectively 

 

reserves for card processing and check guarantee losses 

 

we recognize a reserve for estimated losses related to our card issuing business based on historical experience and other relevant factors in our card issuing business we record estimates to accrue for losses resulting from transaction processing errors we utilize a number of systems and procedures within our card issuing business in order to minimize such transaction processing errors card processing loss reserves are primarily determined by performing a historical analysis of our loss experience and considering other factors that could affect that experience in the future such factors include the general economy and the credit quality of customers once these factors are considered we assess the reserve adequacy by comparing the recorded reserve to the estimated amount based on an analysis of the current trend changes or specific anticipated future events any adjustments are charged to costs of services these card processing loss reserve amounts are subject to risk that actual losses may be different than our estimates 

 

in the check guarantee business if a guaranteed check presented to a merchant customer is dishonored by the check writer’s bank we reimburse our merchant customer for the check’s face value and pursue collection of the amount from the delinquent check writer loss reserves and anticipated recoveries are primarily determined by performing a historical analysis of the check loss and recovery experience and considering other factors that could affect that experience in the future such factors include the general economy the overall industry mix of our customer volumes statistical analysis of check fraud trends within our customer volumes and the quality of returned checks once these factors are considered a rate is established for check losses that is calculated by dividing the expected check losses by dollar volume processed and a rate for anticipated recoveries that is calculated by dividing the anticipated recoveries by the total amount of related check losses these rates are then applied against the dollar volume processed and check losses respectively each month and charged to cost of revenue the estimated check returns and recovery amounts are subject to risk that actual amounts returned and recovered may be different from our estimates 

 

computer software 

 

computer software includes the fair value of software acquired in business combinations purchased software and capitalized software development costs purchased software is recorded at cost and amortized using the straight line method over its estimated useful life and software acquired in business combinations is recorded at its fair value and amortized using straight line and accelerated methods over their estimated useful lives ranging from 3 to 10 years 

 

capitalized software development costs are accounted for in accordance with either sfas no 86 “accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold leased or otherwise marketed” sfas no 86 or with sop no 981 “accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use” after the technological feasibility of the software has been established for sfas no 86 software or at the beginning of application development for sop no 981 software software development costs which include salaries and related payroll costs and costs of independent contractors incurred during development are capitalized research and development costs incurred prior to the establishment of technological feasibility for sfas no 86 software or prior to application development for sop no 981 software are expensed as incurred software development costs are amortized on a product by product basis commencing on the date of general release of the products for sfas no 86 software and the date placed in service for purchased software for sop no 981 software software development costs for sfas no 86 software are amortized using the greater of 1 the straight line method over its estimated useful life which ranges from five to ten years or 2 the ratio of current revenues to total anticipated revenue over its useful life 

 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

 

we have significant intangible assets that were acquired through business acquisitions these assets consist of purchased customer relationships contracts and the excess of purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired goodwill the determination of estimated useful lives and the allocation of the purchase price to the fair values of the intangible assets require significant judgment and may affect the amount of future amortization on the intangible assets other than goodwill 

 

as of december 31 2006 and december 31 2005 goodwill was 37 billion and 18 billion respectively the process of determining whether or not an asset such as goodwill is impaired or recoverable relies on projections of future cash flows operating results and market conditions such projections are inherently uncertain and accordingly actual future cash flows may differ materially from projected cash flows in evaluating the recoverability of goodwill we perform an annual goodwill impairment test on our reporting units based on an analysis of the discounted future net cash flows generated by the reporting units’ underlying assets we completed our annual goodwill impairment test on our reporting units as of december 31 2006 and determined that each of our reporting units has a fair value in excess of its carrying value accordingly no goodwill impairment has been recorded such analyses are particularly sensitive to changes in estimates of future net cash flows and discount rates changes to these estimates might result in material changes in the fair value of the reporting units and determination of the recoverability of goodwill which may result in charges against earnings and a reduction in the carrying value of our goodwill 

 

as of december 31 2006 and december 31 2005 intangible assets were 10 billion and 05 billion respectively which consist primarily of purchased customer relationships and trademarks the valuation of these assets involves significant estimates and assumptions concerning matters such as customer retention future cash flows and discount rates if any of these assumptions change it could affect the carrying value of these assets purchased customer relationships are amortized over their estimated useful lives using an accelerated method which takes into consideration expected customer attrition rates over a tenyear period all trademarks have been determined to have indefinite lives and are not amortized but are reviewed for impairment at least annually in accordance with sfas no 142 during 2005 we recorded an impairment of 93 million to write off the carrying value of customer relationships at one subsidiary in the lender processing services segment which were terminated 

 

longlived assets 

 

we review longlived assets primarily computer software property and equipment and other intangibles such as customer relationships and contracts for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable if indicators of impairment are present we estimate the future net cash flows expected to be generated from the use of those assets and their eventual disposal we would recognize an impairment loss if the aggregate future net cash flows were less than the carrying amount as a result the carrying values of these assets could be significantly affected by the accuracy of the estimates of future net cash flows which are not capable of being made with certainty 

 

accounting for income taxes 

 

through march 9 2005 our operating results have been included in old fnf’s consolidated us federal and certain consolidated andor combined state income tax returns the provision for income taxes in the consolidated and combined statements of earnings is made at rates consistent with what we would have provided for as a standalone taxable entity subsequent to the recapitalization transaction and sale of minority interest we became a standalone taxpayer as part of the process of preparing the consolidated and combined financial statements we were required to determine income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate this process involves estimating actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing recognition of items for income tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred income tax assets and liabilities which are included within the consolidated balance sheets we must then assess the likelihood that deferred income tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely establish a valuation allowance to the extent we established a valuation allowance or increased this 

allowance in a period we must reflect this increase as an expense within income tax expense in the statement of earnings determination of the income tax expense requires estimates and can involve complex issues that may require an extended period to resolve further changes in the geographic mix of revenues or in the estimated level of annual pretax income can cause the overall effective income tax rate to vary from period to period 

 

derivatives and hedging 

 

we utilize interest rate swaps to hedge our exposure on our variable rate debt obligations we have designated these interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges in accordance with sfas no 133 “accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities” as amended all relationships between the hedging instruments and hedged items are documented at the inception of the hedge transaction as well as the riskmanagement objective and strategy for undertaking each hedge transaction we carry the fair value of the interest rate swaps as an asset or a liability on the balance sheet at each reporting date with a corresponding amount recorded in other comprehensive earnings within stockholders’ equity amounts are reclassified from other comprehensive earnings to the income statement in the periods that the hedged transaction affects earnings a formal assessment is performed at the hedge’s inception and on a regular basis thereafter to determine whether the hedge has been highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of the hedged transaction and whether it is expected to be highly effective in the future 

 

our existing cash flow hedges have been highly effective and there has been no impact on earnings due to hedge ineffectiveness as of december 31 2006 and 2005 the estimated fair value of cash flow hedges results in an asset of 49 million and 52 million which is included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets in other assets with a corresponding amount recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive earnings net of deferred taxes 

 

related party transactions 

 

transactions with fnf 

 

we have historically conducted business with old fnf and its subsidiaries in march 2005 in connection with the recapitalization and sale of equity interest we entered into various agreements with old fnf under which we continued to provide title agency services title plant management and it services further we also entered into service agreements with old fnf under which old fnf continued to provide us with corporate services in september 2005 when fidelity national title group inc “fnt” was formed and the title insurance business was consolidated under fnt many of these agreements were amended and restated to take into account the services that would be performed for and by fnt rather than old fnf on february 1 2006 in connection with the closing of the certegy merger many of these agreements were further amended and restated to reflect certain changes in the parties’ relationships certain of these agreements were amended or terminated in connection with the fnf merger and related transactions as described in our current report on form 8k filed with the sec on october 27 2006 a summary of these agreements as in effect through december 31 2006 is as follows 

 

 30 

  

  

a detail of related party items included in revenues is as follows in millions 

 

 

a detail of related party items included in operating expenses is as follows in millions 

 

 

 

we believe the amounts earned from or charged by fnf to us under each of the foregoing service arrangements are fair and reasonable although the 88 commission rate on title insurance policies was set without negotiation we believe it is consistent with the blended rate that would be available to a third party title agent given the amount and the geographic distribution of the business produced and the low risk of loss profile of the business placed in connection with title plant management we charge fnf title insurers for title information at approximately the same rates we and other similar vendors charge unaffiliated title insurers our it infrastructure support and data center management services to fnf are priced within the range of prices we offer to third parties 

 

we also provide data processing services to sedgwick cms a company in which fnf has held an approximately 40 equity interest since february 1 2006 we recorded 173 million in revenue relating to this arrangement with sedgwick in 2006

merger with fnf capital 

 

on october 26 2006 we completed a merger with fnf capital inc “fnf capital” a leasing subsidiary of old fnf we issued 279000 shares of our common stock to old fnf in exchange for a majority ownership in fnf capital the transaction was recorded at old fnf’s historical basis in fnf capital of approximately 23 million and we purchased the minority ownership shortly thereafter for 38 million in cash 

 

the contribution of national new york and the merger with fnf capital were completed between entities under common control and their results of operations and account balances have been included in our results of operations and statement of financial position since the date of the relevant transactions had we included the results of operations and balance sheets for all periods presented in our combined and consolidated financial statements net earnings would have been adjusted by 05 million 02 million and 07 million for 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively and total assets would have increased 822 million as of december 31 2005

on december 31 2006 fnf contributed 525 million to fidelity national real estate solutions inc“fnres” our subsidiary for approximately 61 of the outstanding shares of fnres as a result as of december 31 2006 we no longer consolidate fnres but record our remaining 39 interest as an equity investment in the amount of 335 million the results of fnres are included in the consolidated and combined statements of earnings for all periods presented

recent developments 

 

combination with old fnf 

 

on june 25 2006 we entered into an agreement and plan of merger the “fnf merger agreement” with old fnf amended september 18 2006 the “fnf merger” this fnf merger was one step in a plan that eliminated old fnf’s holding company structure and majority ownership in fis in connection with this plan old fnf also entered into a securities exchange and distribution agreement the “seda” with its subsidiary fnt under the seda old fnf agreed that prior to the merger old fnf would transfer substantially all its assets and liabilities to fnt in exchange for shares of fnt common stock old fnf then would spinoff all shares of fnt stock it held to the stockholders of old fnf in a taxfree distribution pursuant to the fnf merger agreement on november 9 2006 old fnf merged with and into fis with fis continuing as the surviving corporation in consideration for the fnf merger old fnf stockholders received an aggregate of 96521877 shares of our stock for their old fnf shares in addition in connection with the fnf merger we issued options to purchase our common stock and shares of our restricted stock in exchange for old fnf options and restricted stock outstanding at the time of the fnf merger after the completion of all of the transactions fnt was renamed fidelity national financial inc “fnf” and trades under the symbol fnf former old fnf chairman and ceo william p foley ii assumed the same position in fnf and now serves as executive chairman of fis and other key members of old fnf senior management continue their involvement in both fnf and fis in executive capacities 

 

us generally accepted accounting principles require that one of the two parties to the fnf merger be designated as the acquirer for accounting purposes however financial accounting standards board technical bulletin 855 “issues relating to accounting for business combinations” provides that if a transaction lacks substance it is not a purchase event and should be accounted for based on existing carrying amounts in the fnf merger the minority interest in fis has not changed and in substance the only assets and liabilities of the combined entity after the exchange are those of fis prior to the exchange because a change in ownership of the minority interest has not taken place the exchange has been accounted for based on the carrying amounts of our assets and liabilities 

 

factors affecting comparability

recent accounting pronouncements 

 

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 158 “employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other post retirement plans” “sfas 158” sfas 158 requires entities to recognize on their balance sheets the funded status of pension and other postretirement benefit plans entities are required to recognize actuarial gains and losses prior service cost and any remaining transition amounts from the initial application of sfas no 87 “employers’ accounting for pensions” and sfas no 106 “employers’ accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions” when recognizing a plan’s funded status with the offset to accumulated other comprehensive income sfas 158 will not change the amounts recognized in the income statement as net periodic benefit cost all of the requirements of sfas 158 are effective as of december 31 2006 for calendaryear public companies except for a requirement for fiscalyearend measurements of plan assets and benefit obligations with which the company is already in compliance adoption of this standard resulted in the company recording a 69 million pretax adjustment to other longterm liabilities and other comprehensive income 

 

in september 2006 the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 108 topic 1n “considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements” sab 108 this sab addresses how the effects of prioryear uncorrected misstatements should be considered when quantifying misstatements in currentyear financial statements sab 108 requires registrants to quantify misstatements using both the balance sheet and income statement approaches and to evaluate whether either approach results in quantifying an error that is material in light of relevant quantitative and qualitative factors when the effect of initial adoption is determined to be material the sab allows registrants to record that effect as a cumulative effect adjustment to beginningofyear retained earnings sab 108 is effective for annual financial statements covering the first fiscal year ending after november 15 2006 adoption of this standard had no effect on the company’s statements of financial position and operations 

 

in june 2006 the financial accounting standards board issued fasb interpretation number 48 fin 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes” fin 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2006 the interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with fasb statement number 109 accounting for income taxes the interpretation 

outlines recognition thresholds and measurement attributes to determine the amount if any of a tax benefit to be recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements the interpretation also provides guidance on subsequent recognition derecognition measurement recognition of interest and penalties classification and disclosure the company has reviewed fin 48 and has determined that its implementation will not have a material impact on the company’s financial statements 

 

in december 2004 the fasb issued fasb statement no 123r “sfas no 123r” “sharebased payment” which requires that compensation cost relating to sharebased payments be recognized in the financial statements during 2003 fis adopted the fair value recognition provision of statement of financial accounting standards no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” “sfas no 123” for stockbased employee compensation effective as of the beginning of 2003 fis had elected to use the prospective method of transition as permitted by statement of financial accounting standards no 148 “accounting for stockbased compensation — transition and disclosure” “sfas no 148” under this method stockbased employee compensation cost was recognized from the beginning of 2003 as if the fair value method of accounting had been used to account for all employee awards granted modified or settled in years beginning after december 31 2002 sfas no 123r does not allow for the prospective method but requires the recording of expense relating to the vesting of all unvested options beginning in the first quarter of 2006 since sfas no 123 was adopted in 2003 the impact of recording additional expense in 2006 under sfas no 123r relating to options granted prior to january 1 2003 is not significant as all options accounted for under other methods were fully vested as of december 31 2005

   mortgage origination services include customized outsourced business process and information solutions that enable our customers to outsource their title and closing requirements in accordance with preselected criteria regardless of the geographic location of the borrower or property as a result our customers are able to utilize our outsourcing services in a manner that we believe provides a greater level of consistency in service pricing and quality than if these customers were to contract separately for similar services 

7     the primary service offerings are as follows 

   in addition the title and closing services described above can be combined and customized with many of the offerings of our mortgage information services business to meet the specific requirements of our customers 

  the customers of our title agency and closing services are financial institutions involved in the first mortgage refinance home equity and subprime lending markets customers of our title agency and closing services delivered under traditional outsourcing arrangements are typically large national institutions and include wells fargo washington mutual and bank of america our automated title process and ancillary services are targeted at the top 50 us mortgage lenders although we believe that the benefits provided by these automated services may be attractive to other national lenders as well as regional lenders with significant lending operations customers of our homebuilders’ services are us homebuilders including beazer homes trend homes and cambridge homes

sales and marketing 

   our sales and marketing efforts are primarily organized around our lines of business and by customer market segment and distribution channel in our transaction processing services segment we have a sales force that markets our core processing services to our large national bank customers a separate sales group focuses on community based institutions specialized sales items have been established to promote our products to national and regional retailers and the automotive and gaming industries in addition we have a sales force responsible for marketing our services outside the united states we also market other products and services of our transaction processing services segment through indirect sales channels such as icba and cscu independent sales organizations marketing alliances and financial institutions 

  in our lender processing services segment we utilize four distinct sales teams the first sales team is dedicated to the sale and marketing of msp and related services of the mortgage processing services business to large national banks credit unions and thrifts as well as to mortgage companies and specialized servicing companies our mortgage origination default management and mortgage information services businesses each have a dedicated sales and marketing team responsible for its respective products and services of the two teams assigned to the mortgage origination and information services one targets the largest 125 us lenders while the other targets midtier lenders not among the largest 125 

  a significant portion of our potential customers in each of our business lines is targeted via direct andor indirect field sales as well as inbound and outbound telemarketing efforts marketing activities include direct marketing print advertising media relations public relations tradeshow and convention activities seminars and other targeted activities as many of our customers use a single product or service or a combination of products or services our direct sales force also targets existing customers to promote crossselling opportunities our strategy is to use the most efficient delivery system available to successfully acquire customers and build awareness of our products and services 

  in addition to our traditional sales force we have established a core team of senior managers to lead strategic account management for the full range of our services to existing and potential toptier financial institution customers the individuals who participate in this effort which we coordinate through our office of the enterprise or “ooe” spend a significant amount of their time on sales and marketing efforts as well as working with our business units to develop solutions based upon strategic issues impacting customers’ businesses 

  the broad range of services we offer provides us with the opportunity to expand our sales to our existing customer base through strategic account management efforts the importance of our core processing applications to our financial institution customers gives us access to management at a more senior level than we have with our individual business units alone we believe that this access combined with our range of solutions increases sales of our mortgage and banking related services 

  in addition to providing our customers with a broad range of service offerings through the office of the enterprise we are able to assist customers in improving process efficiencies and productivity and enhancing the 

10   consumer’s experience the office of the enterprise has been instrumental in assisting our business units with implementation of these solutions by working with its executive level contacts as well as other key industry players such as fannie mae and freddie mac these activities accelerate implementation and allow lenders to reap the process efficiency benefits of such solutions 

patents trademarks and other intellectual property 

  we rely on a combination of contractual restrictions internal security practices and copyright and trade secret law to establish and protect our software technology and expertise further we have developed a number of brands that have accumulated substantial goodwill in the marketplace and we rely on trademark law to protect our rights in that area we intend to continue our policy of taking all measures we deem necessary to protect our copyright trade secret and trademark rights these legal protections and arrangements afford only limited protection of our proprietary rights and there is no assurance that our competitors will not independently develop or license products services or capabilities that are substantially equivalent or superior to ours in general we believe that we own most proprietary rights necessary for the conduct of our business although we do license certain items none of which is material under armslength agreements for varying terms 

competition 

  in the large bank sector the markets for our core banking products and services are highly competitive the markets are very mature and have a number of existing providers with a high level of experience and significant market share additionally given the attractive market characteristics in financial services there are from time to time new market entrants which seek to leverage shifts in technology or product innovation to attract customers 

  our primary competitors include internal technology departments within banks data processing or software development departments of large companies or large computer manufacturers thirdparty payment processors independent computer services firms companies that develop and deploy software applications companies that provide customized development implementation and support services and companies that market software for the electronic payment industry some of these competitors possess substantially greater financial sales and marketing resources than we do competitive factors for applications and services include the quality of the technologybased application or service application features and functions ease of delivery and integration ability of the provider to maintain enhance and support the applications or services and price we believe that we compete favorably in each of these categories in addition we believe that our ability to offer multiple applications and services to individual customers enhances our competitiveness against competitors with more limited application offerings 

  in the small and midtier financial institution markets we compete with vendors that offer similar core processing applications and services to financial institutions including the bisys group inc accenture fiserv inc jack henry and associates inc and metavante corporation in certain nonus markets we compete with regional providers including alnova iflex and temenos 

  our competitors in the card issuer services market include thirdparty credit and debit card processors such as first data corporation total system services electronic data systems corporation and payment systems for credit unions and thirdparty software providers which license their card processing systems to financial institutions and thirdparty processors competitors in the check risk management services market include first data’s telecheck services division crosscheck efunds and global payments 

  the principal competitors for our mortgage origination and default management services are title companies such as first american and landamerica and inhouse services provided directly by our customers we believe that customer service and timely delivery are key factors in competing successfully 

  the markets for our mortgage information services are also highly competitive key competitive factors include quality of the service convenience speed of delivery customer service and price we do not believe that there is a competitor currently offering the scope of services and market coverage that we provide in our 

11   mortgage information services business however there are a number of competitors in specific lines some of which have substantial resources first american is a significant competitor in a majority of our mortgage information services 

research and development 

  our research and development activities have related primarily to the design and development of our processing systems and related software applications and risk management platforms we expect to continue our practice of investing significant resources to maintain enhance and extend the functionality of our proprietary systems and existing software applications to develop new and innovative software applications and systems in response to the needs of our customers and to enhance the capabilities surrounding our outsourcing infrastructure in addition we intend to offer products and services that are compatible with new and emerging delivery channels 

  our strategy and development group maintains a dialogue with its extensive and diverse customer base and is highly attuned to ongoing shifts in industry requirements and preferences this active customer and market participation is translated into multiyear iterative development plans that map the primary areas of investment in our application set this group is ultimately responsible for designing developing and enhancing applications targeted at the diverse requirements of the various local regional national and international environments of our numerous customers we provide updated versions of our various applications or application suites on an iterative basis as dictated by market requirements our software applications include many application features and functions and will accommodate customized requirements specific to each institution 

  as part of our research and development process we evaluate current and emerging technology for applicability to our existing and future software platforms to this end we engage with various hardware and software vendors in evaluation of various infrastructure components where appropriate we use thirdparty technology components in the development of our software applications and service offerings thirdparty software may be used for highly specialized business functions which we may not be able to develop internally within time and budget constraints additionally thirdparty software may be used for commodity type functions within a technology platform environment in the case of nearly all of our thirdparty software enterprise license agreements exist for the thirdparty component and either alternative suppliers exist or transfer rights exist to ensure the continuity of supply as a result we are not materially dependent upon any thirdparty technology components we work with our customers to determine the appropriate timing and approach to introducing technology or infrastructure changes to our applications and services in the years ended december 31 2005 and december 31 2004 former fis recorded expense of approximately 1135 million and 742 million on research and development efforts 

  we are party to a master services agreement with covansys corporation nasdaq cvns or covansys a usbased provider of application management and offshore outsourcing services with indiabased operations pursuant to which we have agreed subject to certain termination rights to provide 150 million of revenues to covansys over the term of the master services agreement from either our own utilization of covansys’s services or from the utilization of covansys’ services by our existing customers seeking to outsource information technology services the master services agreement expires in 2009 we can terminate the master services agreement on thirty days’ notice at any time after december 31 2006 subject to certain penalties the company is subject to penalties up to 80 million in the event that certain annual thresholds are not met and a final penalty equal to 667 of the unmet commitment the first spending threshold is 500 million from the contract start date through june 30 2006 failure to meet this threshold amount will result in a penalty due of 10 million through december 31 2005 former fis had spent approximately 208 million under the terms of this agreement substantially less than required to meet the june 30 2006 threshold as a result the 1 million penalty has been accrued and is included in selling general and administrative expenses in the year ended december 31 2005 consolidated and combined statement of earnings of former fis 

12     with respect to our outsourcing of software development we are transferring costs from our us and western europeanbased development centers to covansys and other lower cost offshore facilities we are using our relationship with covansys and with other facilities to lower our internal development costs over time by outsourcing certain programming development and maintenance functions 

  we are currently engaged in significant efforts to upgrade our core bank processing software and our mortgage processing software these applications were included in the acquisition of fi from alltel by former fis in 2003 former fis spent the period immediately following the fi acquisition discussing with its key customers the changes that they would like to see made in those applications in 2004 former fis began the development work to implement changes required to keep pace with the marketplace and the requirements of its customers 

  in addition to amounts already spent we expect to spend an incremental 40 million over the next few years on the development of our mortgage servicing platform with respect to the core banking software we expect to spend a total of approximately 55 million on development enhancements and integration projects in 2006 our ongoing efforts to upgrade our mortgage processing and core bank processing software systems have not materially affected our operations or materially impaired our ability to provide customers with services 

government regulation 

  various aspects of our businesses are subject to federal state and foreign regulation our failure to comply with any applicable laws and regulations could result in restrictions on our ability to provide our products and services as well as the imposition of civil fines and criminal penalties 

  as a provider of electronic data processing and backoffice services to financial institutions such as banks thrifts and credit unions we are subject to regulatory oversight and examination by the federal financial institutions examination council an interagency body of the federal deposit insurance corporation the office of thrift supervision the office of the comptroller of the currency the board of governors of the federal reserve system the national credit union administration and various state regulatory authorities in addition independent auditors annually review several of our operations to provide reports on internal controls for our customers’ auditors and regulators we also may be subject to possible review by state agencies that regulate banks in each state in which we conduct our electronic processing activities 

  beginning july 1 2001 financial institutions were required to comply with privacy regulations imposed under the grammleachbliley act these regulations place restrictions on financial institutions’ use of nonpublic personal information all financial institutions must disclose detailed privacy policies to their customers and offer them the opportunity to direct the financial institution not to share information with third parties the new regulations however permit financial institutions to share information with nonaffiliated parties who perform services for the financial institutions as a provider of services to financial institutions we are required to comply with the privacy regulations and are bound by the same limitations on disclosure of the information received from our customers as apply to the financial institutions themselves 

  given that one of the databases that we maintain in the us contains certain data pertaining to the checkwriting histories of consumers and that data is used to provide certain check risk management services our check risk management business is subject to the federal fair credit reporting act and various similar state laws among other things the fair credit reporting act imposes requirements on us concerning data accuracy and provides that consumers have the right to know the contents of their checkwriting histories to dispute their accuracy and to require verification or removal of disputed information in furtherance of our objectives of data accuracy fair treatment of consumers protection of consumers’ personal information and compliance with these laws we maintain a high level of security for our computer systems in which consumer data resides and we maintain consumer relations call centers to facilitate efficient handling of consumer requests for information and handling of disputes 

  our check collection services are subject to the federal fair debt collection practices act and various state collection laws and licensing requirements the federal trade commission as well as state attorneys 

13   general and other agencies have enforcement responsibility over the collection laws as well as the various credit reporting laws 

  elements of our cash access business are registered as a money services business and are subject to the usa patriot act and reporting requirements of the bank secrecy act and us treasury regulations this business is also subject to various state local and tribal licensing requirements the financial crimes enforcement network state attorneys general and other agencies have enforcement responsibility over laws relating to money laundering currency transmission and licensing 

  the real estate settlement procedures act or respa and related regulations generally prohibit the payment or receipt of fees or any other item of value for the referral of a real estatesecured loan to a loan broker or lender and fee shares or splits or unearned fees in connection with the provision of residential real estate settlement services such as mortgage brokerage and real estate brokerage notwithstanding these prohibitions respa permits payments for goods furnished or for services actually performed so long as those payments bear a reasonable relationship to the market value of the goods or services provided respa and related regulations may to some extent restrict our real estaterelated businesses from entering into certain preferred alliance arrangements the us department of housing and urban development is responsible for enforcing respa 

  real estate appraisers are subject to regulation in most states and some state appraisal boards have sought to prohibit our automated valuation applications courts have limited such prohibitions in part on the ground of preemption by the federal financial institutions reform recovery and enforcement act of 1989 but we cannot assure you that our valuation and appraisal services business will not be subject to regulation 

  the title agency and related services we provide are conducted through a underwritten title company title agencies and individual escrow officers the underwritten title company operates only in california the regulation of an underwritten title company in california is generally limited to requirements to maintain specified levels of net worth and working capital and to obtain and maintain a license in each of the counties in california in which it operates the title agencies and individual escrow officers are also subject to regulation by the insurance or banking regulators in many jurisdictions these regulators generally require among other items that agents and individuals obtain and maintain a license and be appointed by a title insurer 

  the california department of insurance has recently commenced a review of levels of pricing and competition in the title insurance industry in california in part with a view to determining whether prices are too high and if so implementing rate reductions new york colorado florida nevada and texas insurance regulators have also announced similar inquiries or other review of title insurance rates and other states could follow at this stage we are unable to predict what the outcome will be of this or any similar review 

  given that we conduct business in international markets as well as in the us we are subject to laws and regulations in jurisdictions outside the us that regulate many of the same activities that are described above including electronic data processing and backoffice services for financial institutions and use of consumer information 

  the irs has proposed regulations under section 468b regarding the taxation of the income earned on escrow accounts trusts and other funds used during deferred exchanges of likekind property and under section 7872 regarding belowmarket loans to facilitators of these exchanges the proposed regulations affect taxpayers that engage in likekind exchanges and escrow holders trustees qualified intermediaries and others that hold funds during likekind exchanges the proposed regulations are scheduled to be discussed at a public hearing on june 6 2006 we currently do not know what the effect of these changes will have on our 1031 exchange businesses 

  although we do not believe that compliance with future laws and regulations related to our businesses including future consumer protection laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on our company enactment of new laws and regulations may increasingly affect the operations of our business directly or indirectly which could result in substantial regulatory compliance costs litigation expense adverse publicity andor loss of revenue

 item 1a risk factors tableend   in addition to the normal risks of business we are subject to significant risks and uncertainties including those listed below and others described elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k any of the risks described herein could result in a significant adverse effect on our results of operation and financial condition 

risks resulting from our recently completed business combination 

   as a result of our recently completed business combination fnf owns approximately 507 of the outstanding shares of our common stock subject to limitations under a shareholders agreement that we entered into with fnf as long as fnf continues to hold a majority of our outstanding common stock fnf will be able to elect all of our directors and determine the outcome of all corporate actions requiring shareholder approval further under the shareholders agreement until fnf no longer owns at least 30 of the total voting power of our outstanding stock fnf will have the right to approve the hiring and firing of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer and our annual operating and capital expenditure budgets 

  fnf’s voting control will enable it to control decisions with respect to 

   although it will control whether we can merge or combine with a third party fnf has agreed under the shareholders agreement to certain limitations on its ability to cause us to engage in transactions which are commonly referred to as “goingprivate transactions” 

  in addition to these effects fnf’s control could make it more difficult for us to raise capital by selling stock or for us to use our stock as currency in acquisitions this concentrated ownership also might delay or prevent a change in control and may impede or prevent transactions in which our other shareholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares 

15   

   conflicts may arise between fnf fnf’s majority owned subsidiary fidelity national title group inc or fnt or their respective subsidiaries on the one hand and us on the other as a result of the parties’ ongoing agreements and the nature of their respective businesses among other things we and our subsidiaries are parties to a variety of service agreements with fnf fnt or fnt’s subsidiaries certain of our executive officers and directors will be subject to conflicts of interest with respect to these service agreements and other matters due to their relationships with fnf fnt or their respective subsidiaries 

  some of our executive officers and directors own substantial amounts of fnf and fnt stock and stock options because of their relationships with fnf and fnt such ownership could create or appear to create potential conflicts of interest when our directors and officers are faced with decisions that involve fnf fnt or any of their respective subsidiaries each of william p foley ii daniel d ron lane and cary h thompson who are members of our board of directors beneficially owns shares of fnf common stock other of our senior officers hold interests in fnf that were obtained through various employee benefit and compensation plans while at fnf and former fis in addition officers of fnf will provide services from time to time to us fnt and fnf these persons also hold equity interests in fnf 

  mr foley the chairman of our board of directors is also the chief executive officer and chairman of the board of directors of fnf and chairman of the board of directors of fnt as an officer and director of these companies he has obligations to us as well as to fnf and fnt and will have conflicts of interest with respect to matters potentially or actually involving or affecting us and fnf or any of its subsidiaries including fnt 

  matters that could give rise to conflicts between us and fnf or its other subsidiaries include among other things 

   we seek to manage these potential conflicts through dispute resolution and other provisions of our agreements with fnf fnt and their respective subsidiaries and through oversight by independent members of our board of directors however there can be no assurance that such measures will be effective or that we will be able to resolve all potential conflicts with fnf or that the resolution of any such conflicts will be no less favorable to us than if it were dealing with an unaffiliated third party 

   mr foley the chairman of our board of directors is also the chairman of fnt’s board of directors and the chief executive officer and chairman of the board of directors of fnf as an officer and director of multiple companies he has obligations to us as well as fnf and fnt and may have conflicts of time with respect to matters potentially or actually involving or affecting us as a nonexecutive chairman it is expected that mr foley will devote a minority of his time to us if his duties as our chairman require more time than mr foley is able to allot then his oversight of our activities could be diminished 

16   

   following completion of the business combination we had total debt of approximately 31 billion this high level of debt could have important consequences to us including the following 

   in addition the terms of our senior credit facilities may restrict us from taking actions such as making acquisitions or dispositions or entering into certain agreements that we might believe to be advantageous to us 

   the historical financial statements of former fis do not reflect operations as a separate standalone entity for the historical periods presented prior to march 9 2005 the date on which former fis engaged in a private placement of a minority interest in its common stock and was no longer a wholly owned subsidiary of fnf because prior to that date former fis’ businesses were either wholly owned subsidiaries of fnf or were operated as divisions of wholly owned subsidiaries of fnf former fis’ historical financial statements prior to that date were carved out from the consolidated financial statements of fnf using assets liabilities revenues and expenses directly attributable to its operations and allocations to former fis of certain corporate expenses of fnf further former fis’ historical financial statements prior to that date do not reflect the debt or interest expense former fis might have incurred if it had been a standalone entity as a result of these and other factors former fis’ historical financial statements for periods prior to march 9 2005 do not necessarily reflect what its financial position and results of operations would have been if it had been operated as a standalone public entity during the periods covered and may not be indicative of future results of operations or financial position as part of our combined company

   the success of our recently completed business combination will depend in large part upon our ability to integrate the organizations operations systems and personnel of former fis and certegy the integration of two previously independent companies is a challenging timeconsuming and costly process it is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees the disruption of each company’s ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards controls procedures and policies that adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with suppliers customers and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the business combination in addition successful integration of the companies will require the dedication of significant management resources which will temporarily detract attention from our daytoday businesses if management is not able to integrate the organizations operations systems and personnel of former fis and certegy in a timely and efficient manner the anticipated benefits of the business combination may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected 

failure to achieve expected synergies could result in the benefits of the business combination not being attained 

  we expect that our recently completed business combination will result in beneficial synergies for us and our subsidiaries achieving these anticipated synergies however will depend on a number of factors some of which include 

   the failure to achieve anticipated synergies could result in a failure to attain expected benefits to our combined business financial condition and operating results 

   while we intend to take advantage of the business combination to seek crossselling opportunities such crossselling efforts may face potential challenges for various reasons such as difficulties in coordinating and incentivizing employees within one combined company and maintaining optimal quality control managing existing customers’ potential resistance to outsourcing functions to a new vendor and other matters if the crossselling synergies for increased revenue do not occur the benefits of the business combination may not be achieved 

   under the shareholders agreement entered into in connection with our business combination fnf agreed and agreed to cause fnt and certain of its other affiliates to agree not to compete with us in certain significant lines of business however these restrictions do not cover certain other lines of business in which we will operate such as title agency services our mortgage origination services business provides centralized title agency services to large national lenders and the revenues of former fis for 2005 from this business were 809 million through its fnt operations fnf provides similar national title agency services further although we have agreed to place all title insurance business our title agency services generate with fnt’s title insurers the latter are free to deal with other third party title agents 

18     as previously noted certain of our officers and directors are subject to conflicts of interest with respect to our business activities which compete with fnf fnt or any of their respective subsidiaries in addition due to the significant resources of fnf including financial resources fnf could have a significant competitive advantage over us if and when we compete with them which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

   in connection with the business combination we entered into a registration rights agreement with the former stockholders of former fis requiring us to register the shares of our common stock that are now beneficially owned by them consequently we have to date registered for resale from time to time shares which collectively account for approximately 167 of our shares outstanding after the merger sales of these shares or the possibility that sales of these shares or of other shares issued in the business combination may occur in unlimited amounts and without prior notice could adversely affect the trading price of our shares 

risks related to our business 

   the markets for our services are characterized by constant technological changes frequent introductions of new services and evolving industry standards our future success will be significantly affected by our ability to enhance our current products and services and develop and introduce new products and services that address the increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers and their clients these initiatives carry the risks associated with any new product or service development effort including cost overruns delays in delivery and performance issues there can be no assurance that we will be successful in developing marketing and selling new products and services that meet these changing demands that we will not experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development introduction and marketing of these products and services or that our new products and services and their enhancements will adequately meet the demands of the marketplace and achieve market acceptance 

  for example the specific products and services that we deliver to the electronic payments market are designed to process transactions and deliver reports and other information on those transactions at very high volumes and processing speeds any performance issue that arises with a new product or service could result in significant processing or reporting errors as a result of these factors our research and development efforts could result in increased costs that could reduce our revenues and operating income if new products are not delivered timely to our customers or a loss of revenue or possible claims for damages if new products and services do not perform as anticipated 

  additionally we currently are engaged in significant efforts to upgrade two of our most important applications our core bank processing software and our mortgage processing software these applications were acquired upon our acquisition of fidelity information services inc or fi from alltel information services inc in 2003 we spent the period immediately following the acquisition discussing with key customers the changes that they would like to see made in those products in 2004 we began the development work to implement changes required to keep pace with the marketplace and the requirements of our customers in addition to amounts already spent we expect to spend approximately 400 million on the development of our mortgage servicing platform with respect to the core banking software during 2005 we spent approximately 560 million on enhancement and integration projects and during 2006 we expect to spend approximately 550 million on such projects if we are unsuccessful in completing or gaining market acceptance of these and other upgrade efforts it would likely have a material adverse effect on our ability to retain existing customers or attract new ones 

19   

   the market for our services is intensely competitive our competitors vary in size and in the scope and breadth of the services they offer some of our competitors have substantial resources we face direct competition from third parties and since many of our larger potential customers have historically developed their key applications inhouse and therefore view their system requirements from a makeversusbuy perspective we often compete against our potential customers’ inhouse capacities in addition we expect that the markets in which we compete will continue to attract new competitors and new technologies there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors or that competitive pressures we face in the markets in which we operate will not materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

   as part of our growth strategy we have made numerous acquisitions in recent years we anticipate that we will continue to seek to acquire complementary businesses products and services this strategy will depend on the ability to find suitable acquisitions and finance them on acceptable terms we may require additional debt or equity financing for future acquisitions and doing so will be made more difficult by our substantial debt if we are unable to acquire suitable acquisition candidates we may experience slower growth 

  further even if we successfully complete acquisitions we will face challenges in integrating any acquired business these challenges include eliminating redundant operations facilities and systems coordinating management and personnel retaining key employees managing different corporate cultures and achieving cost reductions and crossselling opportunities there can be no assurance that we will be able to fully integrate all aspects of acquired businesses successfully or fully realize the potential benefits of bringing them together and the process of integrating these acquisitions may disrupt our business and divert our resources 

   revenues from information services and lender services operations are closely related to the general level of real estate transactions such as real estate sales and mortgage refinancings real estate sales are affected by a number of factors including mortgage interest rates the availability of funds to finance purchases and general economic conditions prevailing mortgage interest declined to record lows in recent years and the volume of real estate transactions experienced record highs however these trends did not continue and the volume of refinancing transactions in particular and mortgage originations in general declined in 2004 and again in 2005 from 2003 levels resulting in reduction of revenues in some of our businesses some of our services and related applications including our automated title agent process that accounted for substantial revenues from our lender services operations in 2003 are currently used exclusively for refinancing transactions our revenues in future periods will continue to be subject to these and other factors which are beyond our control and as a result are likely to fluctuate 

   in order to provide our card services we must be designated a certified processor by and be a member service provider of mastercard and be designated as an independent sales organization of visa these designations are dependent upon our continuing adherence to the standards of the visa and mastercard associations the member financial institutions of visa and mastercard some of which are our competitors set the standards with which we must comply if we fail to comply with these standards our designation as a certified processor as a member service provider or as an independent sales organization could be suspended or terminated the termination of our member service provider status or our status as a certified processor or 

20   any changes in the visa and mastercard rules that prevent our registration or otherwise limit our ability to provide transaction processing and marketing services for the visa or mastercard organizations would result in the loss of business from visa or mastercard issuing customers and lead to a reduction in our revenues which would have a material adverse effect on our business  

   there has been and continues to be substantial merger acquisition and consolidation activity in the banking and financial services industry mergers or consolidations of banks and financial institutions in the future could reduce the number of our customers and potential customers which could adversely affect our revenues even if these events do not reduce the aggregate number of customers or the banking and other activities of the consolidated entities if our customers merge with or are acquired by other entities that are not our customers or that use fewer of our services they may discontinue or reduce their use of our services in addition it is possible that the larger banks or financial institutions resulting from mergers or consolidations could decide to perform inhouse some or all of the services which we currently provide or could provide any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

   our customers are subject to a number of government regulations and industry standards with which our products and services must comply for example our products are affected by visa and mastercard electronic payment standards that are generally updated twice annually in addition action by regulatory authorities relating to credit availability data usage privacy or other related regulatory developments could have an adverse effect on our customers and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

   a significant portion of our revenue is derived from transaction processing fees any changes in economic factors that adversely affect consumer spending and related consumer debt or a reduction in check writing or credit and debit card usage could reduce the volume of transactions that we process and have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

   for banks and other potential customers of our financial information software and services segment switching from one vendor of bank core processing or related software and services or from an internallydeveloped system to a new vendor is a significant undertaking many potential customers worry about potential disadvantages such as loss of accustomed functionality increased costs and business disruption as a result potential customers both in the us and internationally often resist change we seek to overcome this resistance through strategies such as making investments to enhance the functionality of our software however there can be no assurance that our strategies for overcoming potential customers’ reluctance to change vendors will be successful and this resistance may adversely affect our growth both in the us and internationally 

21   

   the implementation of many of our applications often involves significant capital commitments by our customers particularly those with smaller operational scale potential customers generally commit significant resources to an evaluation of available software and require us to expend substantial time effort and money educating them as to the value of our software and services we incur substantial costs in order to obtain each new customer we may expend significant funds and management resources during the sales cycle and ultimately fail to close the sale our sales cycle may be extended due to our customers’ budgetary constraints or for other reasons if we are unsuccessful in closing sales after expending significant funds and management resources or we experience delays it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

   our domestic card issuer business is concentrated in the independent community bank and credit union segments of the market and we have achieved a significant degree of penetration of these market segments while we intend to continue our vigorous pursuit of expansion within these segments future growth and profitability of this business will significantly depend upon our ability to penetrate other markets including emerging markets for electronic transaction processing such as international transaction processing and internet payment systems as part of our strategy to achieve this expansion we will continue to seek acquisition opportunities investments and alliance relationships that will facilitate our expansion however we may not be able to complete suitable acquisitions investments or alliances and if we do they may not provide us with the benefits we anticipated also we may not have adequate financial and technological resources to develop products and distribution channels that will satisfy the demands of new markets 

   many of our services are based on sophisticated software and computing systems and we may encounter delays when developing new applications and services further the software underlying our services has occasionally contained and may in the future contain undetected errors or defects when first introduced or when new versions are released in addition we may experience difficulties in installing or integrating our technologies on platforms used by our customers defects in our software errors or delays in the processing of electronic transactions or other difficulties could result in 

   although we attempt to limit our potential liability through disclaimers and limitationofliability provisions in our license and customer agreements we cannot be certain that these measures will be successful in limiting our liability 

22   

   as part of our business we electronically receive process store and transmit sensitive business information of our customers in addition we collect personal consumer data such as names and addresses social security numbers driver’s license numbers checking and savings account numbers and payment history records unauthorized access to our computer systems or databases could result in the theft or publication of confidential information or the deletion or modification of records or could otherwise cause interruptions in our operations these concerns about security are increased when we transmit information over the internet computer viruses have also been distributed and have rapidly spread over the internet computer viruses could infiltrate our systems disrupting our delivery of services and making our applications unavailable any inability to prevent security breaches or computer viruses could also cause existing customers to lose confidence in our systems and terminate their agreements with us and could inhibit our ability to attract new customers 

   as a provider of services to financial institutions we are bound by the same limitations on disclosure of the information we receive from our customers as apply to the financial institutions themselves if we fail to comply with these regulations we could be exposed to suits for breach of contract or to governmental proceedings our customer relationships and reputation could be harmed and we could be inhibited in our ability to obtain new customers in addition if more restrictive privacy laws or rules are adopted in the future on the federal or state level or with respect to our international operations by authorities in foreign jurisdictions on the national provincial state or other level that could have an adverse impact on us 

   our ability to provide reliable service in a number of our businesses depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operations of our computer network systems and data centers our systems and operations could be exposed to damage or interruption from fire natural disaster power loss telecommunications failure unauthorized entry and computer viruses although we have taken steps to prevent system failures we cannot be certain that our measures will be successful further our property and business interruption insurance may not be adequate to compensate us for all losses or failures that may occur any significant interruptions could 

   any one or more of the foregoing occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

   if a check that we have guaranteed is dishonored by the check writer’s bank we must reimburse our merchant customer for the check’s face value and pursue collection of the amount from the delinquent check writer in some cases we recognize a liability to our merchant customers for estimated check returns and a receivable for amounts we estimate we will recover from the check writers based on historical experience and other relevant factors the estimated check returns and recovery amounts are subject to the risk that actual amounts returned may exceed our estimates and actual amounts recovered may be less than our estimates 

23   

   by outsourcing development functions overseas we may experience quality control issues in our applications offered to our markets overseas outsourcing operations are subject to risk of quality control deficiencies due to the physical distance from our headquarters the increased potential for instructions and guidance to be misunderstood a lack of direct institutional control and the time and expense it will take to provide on site training any one of these factors make it more difficult for us to maintain quality control and the potential for quality control issues may impact our ability to maintain and or increase our customer base 

   our ability to compete depends upon proprietary systems and technology despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our services or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary policing unauthorized use of our proprietary rights is difficult we cannot make any assurances that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of technology or that the agreements entered into for that purpose will be enforceable effective trademark service mark copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our applications and services are made available online misappropriation of our intellectual property or potential litigation concerning such matters could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 

   as our information technology applications and services develop we may become increasingly subject to infringement claims any claims whether with or without merit could 

   there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against us in the future with respect to our current or future applications and services 

   in 2005 sales outside of the us represented approximately 67 of the revenues of former fis additionally approximately 164 of the consolidated revenues of certegy for the year ended december 31 2005 and 381 of certegy’s consolidated assets at december 31 2005 are associated with operations outside of the us 

  we believe there are additional opportunities to expand our international operations and we expect to commit significant resources to expand our international sales and marketing activities however overall we are less wellknown internationally than in the united states and have less experience with local business conditions in addition we will face challenges in successfully managing small operations located far from our 

24   headquarters because of the greater difficulty in overseeing and guiding operations from a distance and we will be increasingly subject to a number of other risks and potential costs including 

   there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future international competitors or that our relative inexperience with international operations will not limit or hinder our success

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend   our current business operations and organizational structure result from the business combination on february 1 2006 of certegy inc or certegy and fidelity national information services inc a delaware corporation or former fis pursuant to which former fis was merged into a whollyowned subsidiary of certegy 

  unless stated otherwise or the context otherwise requires all references in the following discussion and analysis to “us” “we” “our” or the “company” are to fidelity national information services inc a georgia corporation formerly known as certegy inc and its subsidiaries all references to “certegy” are to certegy inc and its subsidiaries prior to the merger all references to “former fis” are to fidelity national information services inc a delaware corporation and its subsidiaries prior to the merger all references to “fnf” are to fidelity national financial inc a delaware corporation that owns a majority of our outstanding shares and all references to the “merger” are to the merger on february 1 2006 of former fis into a whollyowned subsidiary of certegy 

  the following discussion and analysis focuses on the financial condition and results of operations of certegy for the historical periods presented which are prior to the merger and should be read in conjunction with item 6 selected financial data and item 8 financial statements and supplementary data included elsewhere in this report because the stockholders of former fis now hold a majority of our outstanding shares of common stock for accounting and financial reporting purposes the merger will be treated as a reverse acquisition of certegy by former fis under the purchase method of accounting pursuant to accounting principles generally accepted in the us “gaap” accordingly our historical financial information for periods prior to the merger presented in future reports covering postmerger periods will be the historical financial information of former fis rather than certegy 

31     throughout this management’s discussion and analysis we refer to certain financial amounts both on a beforeand aftertax basis management believes it is helpful to include the aftertax effect of certain financial charges to allow investors and management to evaluate their impact on net income and diluted earnings per share 

overview 

  during fiscal year 2005 certegy’s business consisted of providing credit card debit card and other transaction processing and check risk management services to financial institutions and merchants in the us and internationally through two segments card services and check services card services provided card issuer services in the us the uk brazil chile australia new zealand ireland thailand the caribbean and canada additionally card services provided merchant processing and ebanking services in the us and card issuer software support and consulting services in numerous countries check services provided check risk management services and related processing services in the us the uk canada france ireland australia and new zealand 

  shortly after consummating the merger we implemented our new organizational structure and we will report under a new operating segment structure beginning with the reporting of first quarter 2006 results effective as of february 1 2006 the reportable segments of the combined company are transaction processing services or tps and lender processing services or lps this structure reflects how our businesses are now being managed consistent with the new operating structure that we adopted following the merger certegy’s former reportable segments of card and check services are now included in the tps segment 

  card services the card services business provides a full range of card issuer services that enable banks credit unions retailers and others to issue visa and mastercard credit and debit cards private label cards and other electronic payment cards for use by both consumer and business accounts additionally we process american express cards in australia the caribbean and brazil our debit card services support both offline debit cards which are processed similarly to credit cards and online debit cards through which cardholders obtain immediate access to funds in their bank accounts through atms or merchant pointof sale terminals in the us our card processing business is concentrated in the independent community bank and credit union segments of the market we have longterm contractual alliances with two trade associations representing independent community banks and credit unions in the us the independent community bankers of america “the icba” and card services for credit unions “cscu” which expire in 2011 and 2009 respectively internationally we service both large and small financial institutions and provide our card issuer services through our operations in the us brazil chile the uk australia and the caribbean our merchant processing services enable retailers and other businesses to accept credit debit and other electronic payment cards from purchasers of their goods and services while our ebanking services enable financial institutions to offer internet banking and related products to consumers and businesses card issuing software support and consulting services allow customers to manage their credit card programs 

  card transactions continue to increase as a percentage of total pointof sale payments which fuels continuing demand for cardrelated products we continue to launch new products aimed at serving this demand in recent years we have introduced a variety of storedvalue card types internet banking and electronic bill presentmentpayment products as well as a number of card enhancement and loyaltyreward programs the common theme among these offerings continues to be convenience and security for the consumer coupled with value to the financial institution additionally in 2004 certegy acquired crittson financial services llc “crittson” a fullservice provider of card and merchant processing services 

  we continue to pursue growth in the international markets in 2003 certegy entered into an eightyear agreement with a thailand financial institution to process its visa and mastercard credit cards and unsecured personal loans in 2004 certegy acquired caribbean caricard services inc “caricard” a third party transaction processor in the caribbean in 2005 certegy announced that it finalized a multiyear transaction processing agreement with a leading european retail specialist service group to provide card and loan transaction processing services to its subsidiaries in the uk spain portugal belgium and holland 

32   recently we signed a sevenyear extension of our card processing agreement with a multinational australianbased financial institution 

  we believe that the increased use of credit debit and other electronic payment cards around the globe will continue to present the card processing industry with significant growth opportunities we intend to continue to expand our card processing business in the independent community bank and credit union segments of the market moreover our future growth and profitability will significantly depend upon our ability to penetrate additional international markets including emerging markets for electronic transaction processing our certification as an american express processor also provides further growth opportunities for us in the global card market 

  check services check services provides check risk management and related processing products and services to businesses accepting or cashing checks at the pointofsale these services utilize our proprietary check authorization systems and risk assessment decision platforms a significant portion of our revenues from check risk management services is generated from several large national merchants including the nation’s leading retail chains other customers of our check services segment include hotels automotive dealers telecommunications companies supermarkets casinos mail order houses and other small regional businesses our services allow our clients to run their customers’ personal and business checks through an automated decisionmaking process that assesses the likelihood that a check will clear we provide our check risk management products and services internationally in canada the uk ireland france australia and new zealand our principal product in all those countries is check guarantee services although mass retailers are beginning to utilize our check verification collection services and deferred debit processing services 

  in recent years we have introduced several new products for existing and new markets such as thirdparty check collections electronic check risk management solutions for pointofsale call center and electronic commerce applications and paycheck accept tm  which enables supermarkets and gaming establishments to reduce the risk of check losses and fraud in connection with their payroll check cashing services additionally the acquisition of game financial corporation “game financial” on march 1 2004 helps position us as a leading provider of comprehensive cash access services in the gaming industry and broadens our check risk management product line and customer base on february 1 2006 we acquired certain assets of fastfunds financial corporation “fastfunds” and its whollyowned subsidiary chex services inc “chex services” fastfunds through chex services provides comprehensive cash access services including check cashing automated teller machine access and credit and debit card cash advance services to approximately 50 casinos and gaming establishments in the us canada and the caribbean this acquisition further strengthens our position in the gaming industry and provides new growth opportunities in the native american and caribbean markets 

  we believe check writing has been declining as a total percentage of pointofsale payments due in part to the growing use of other payment means such as credit debit and other electronic payment cards at the same time however demand for our services is strong due to factors that include increasing sophistication of check fraud and higher concentration of bad checks written at the pointofsale due to a trend of higher credit quality consumers writing fewer checks and paying more with cards these factors are contributing to a growing reliance of retailers and other businesses on outside vendors such as certegy to provide check risk management services 

  annually we experience a decline in base volumes related to factors that include customer attrition which in recent years has been largely isolated to our regional small customer base our base volumes are also impacted by the migration of consumers to other payment means and the retail sales activity of our customers which can be affected by general economic conditions and other factors that may relate to certain retailers we believe that many consumers who rely on checks as a means of retail payment may be more heavily impacted by certain economic factors than the consuming population as a whole we are unable to accurately quantify the specific impact of each of these individual factors on the annual decline in base volumes typically the addition of new customers offsets the decline in base volumes during 2005 total check volumes increased by approximately 13 billion or 315 percent verification volumes grew by 118 billion which is more than double the prior year’s volumes while guarantee volumes grew 09 billion or 28 percent as the 

33   recent mix of new customers has been more focused in our verification products over time we expect the trend of customers using verification products to migrate over to guarantee products to continue 

  key performance indicators management uses various key indicators to manage its business including revenue and operating income growth operating margin earnings per share growth number of cards and accounts on file and volumes processed

  merger and acquisition costs merger and acquisition “ma” costs consist of investment banking legal accounting and other direct costs related to the merger with former fis and the possible formation and acquisition of a majority ownership in a card processing joint venture in brazil during 2005 certegy was selected to exclusively negotiate with two of the largest card issuing banks in brazil to establish and acquire a majority ownership interest in a new joint venture company that will provide a wide range of card processing services currently it is anticipated that the card issuing banks will contribute longterm exclusive processing contracts to the joint venture and we will contribute consideration of cash and other capital which may include part or all of our existing brazilian operations we cannot at this time predict the timing or ultimate outcome of this possible joint venture certegy incurred 112 million of ma costs related to these transactions during 2005 merger costs of 83 million are included in corporate expense while 29 million in joint venture costs are included in card services

  discontinued operations certegy’s merchant processing operations previously consisted of two businesses 1 merchant acquiring which was sold in 2005 where certegy was a direct party to contracts with merchants regarding the provision of card processing services for the merchant and certegy was subject to the associated risk that a cardholder billing dispute would be resolved in favor of the cardholder referred to as a cardholder “chargeback” and 2 institution processing which provides authorization settlement and customer service to community banks and others that contract directly with merchant customers certegy viewed merchant acquiring as a nonstrategic business and over the past few years had operated this business conservatively to reduce exposure to merchant risk which in the shortterm improved overall profitability but limited growth fis plans to continue to operate the institution processing business which we believe is complementary to our card issuing business 

34     during the second quarter of 2005 certegy completed the sale of a majority of its merchant acquiring business for 570 million and recognized an aftertax gain of 273 million 043 per diluted share on the sale also during the second quarter of 2005 certegy recorded a 68 million aftertax writedown 011 per diluted share of its remaining merchant acquiring portfolio to its estimated net realizable value in the third quarter of 2005 certegy completed the sale of its remaining discontinued merchant acquiring portfolio for 30 million of cash which approximated net book value at the date of the sale

  selling general and administrative “sga” expenses in 2004 of 1297 million increased 140 million or 121 percent over 2003 card services experienced a 28 million or 67 percent increase in sga costs driven primarily by higher international business development costs and the growth in north american card issuing operations which more than offset the reduction in sga costs for the downsizing of the brazilian card operations in march 2003 sga costs in check services increased 76 million or 152 percent primarily as a result of the acquisition of game financial and the growth in our cash access operations corporate sga expense increased 35 million or 154 percent primarily due to higher audit fees related to sarbanesoxley section 404 compliance and higher employee benefit and relocation costs 

  during 2003 certegy recorded other charges of 122 million 77 million aftertax these charges include 96 million of early termination costs associated with a us data processing contract 27 million of charges related to the downsizing of the brazilian card operation and 01 million of market value recoveries on the collateral assignment in life insurance policies net of severance charges

  the operating income growth experienced in 2005 was driven by improved profitability in the check services segment primarily attributable to lower check guarantee net losses and growth in our cash access business as well as growth in the north american and international card issuing operations which more than offset the 112 million of ma costs incurred in 2005 and the negative impact of foreign currency on operating income the impact of changes of certain foreign currencies against the us dollar decreased total us dollar operating income by approximately 21 million in 2005 

   certegy’s consolidated operating income in 2004 increased 303 million or 219 percent over 2003 card services operating income increased 179 million or 151 percent while check services operating income increased 162 million or 382 percent general corporate expense increased 39 million over 2003 the consolidated operating margin grew from 150 percent in 2003 to 162 percent in 2004 the 2003 consolidated operating income includes 122 million of other charges

   certegy’s interest expense in 2005 2004 and 2003 totaled 128 million 129 million and 80 million respectively the increase in 2005 and 2004 was driven by the issuance of the 200 million of fiveyear notes at 475 percent in september 2003 which resulted in a higher rate of interest during 2004 certegy borrowed additional funds on the revolving credit facility for acquisitions and share repurchases which were repaid in 2005 in addition the new lease accounting fin 46 on the st petersburg florida operations facility which became effective on december 31 2003 resulted in higher interest expense in 2005 and 2004 

   certegy’s effective tax rates for continuing operations were 395 percent 377 percent and 380 percent in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively the slightly lower effective rates in the more recent years when excluding the impact of nondeductible ma costs in 2005 were driven by the implementation of certain international and state tax planning strategies and the impact of expensing stock options in accordance with sfas 123r which is attributable to there being more deductible stock compensation expense in conjunction with higher operating income in each year as compared to the prior year 

  during 2005 certegy incurred ma costs of 112 million associated with the merger with former fis and the proposed brazilian joint venture a tax benefit for these costs was not recorded because the ultimate tax treatment of these costs cannot be determined with adequate certainty at this time this resulted in an increase in the 2005 effective tax rate of approximately two percentage points 

 

   certegy’s income from continuing operations of 1055 million in 2005 increased 78 million or 80 percent above 2004 while diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of 166 increased 013 or 85 percent income from continuing operations in 2005 includes 112 million of ma costs income from discontinued operations in 2005 which includes an aftertax gain on sale of 273 million or 043 per diluted share and an aftertax writedown of 68 million or 011 per diluted share totaled 248 million in 2005 compared to 59 million in 2004

   check services revenues of 4651 million in 2005 increased 160 million or 36 percent over 2004 primarily driven by growth in the cash access business attributable to increased volumes and new customer signings in the game financial business which was acquired in 2004 and the continued rollout of our payroll checkcashing services to grocers and other retailers the weakening of certain foreign currencies against the us dollar decreased the us dollar revenues by approximately 08 million in 2005 the face amount of checks certegy authorized totaled 530 billion in 2005 as compared to 403 billion in the prior year with an 118 billion increase in verification volumes and a 09 billion increase in guarantee volumes 

  north american check revenues of 3874 million increased 125 million or 33 percent over 2004 growth in the cash access business as well as growth from new customers and thirdparty collections was partially offset by reduced revenue in the domestic pointofsale business as the increase in check volumes 

42   was offset by lower losssensitive revenues and a reduction in the average billing rate attributable to lowerrisk verticals that are priced based on risk such as the grocery industry the success of certegy’s risk initiatives has reduced losssensitive revenues such as service fees and risksharing contracts cash access transactions and check volumes were negatively impacted by the gulf coast storms in 2005 and the resulting impact of the rising energy prices on retail spending the face amount of checks certegy authorized in the us totaled 495 billion in 2005 as compared to 365 billion in the prior year with a 118 billion increase in verification volumes and a 11 billion increase in guarantee volumes

  the weakening of certain foreign currencies against the us dollar decreased the us dollar revenues by approximately 08 million in 2005

   certegy’s general corporate expense of 353 million in 2005 increased 87 million over 2004 due to 83 million of ma costs related to the merger higher audit fees and certain employeerelated expenses which more than offset reduced sharebased compensation costs

liquidity and capital resources 

  certegy has historically generated strong cash flows from operating activities that are used to further invest in the business through expenditures for capital and strategic acquisitions additionally certegy has engaged in periodic repurchases of its common shares when deemed appropriate and began to pay cash dividends to shareholders in 2003 additional cash flows have been generated from stock option exercises which vary each year due to changes in the stock price and the sale of the merchant acquiring business in 2005 

  on march 1 2004 certegy completed the purchases of game financial and crittson and on august 6 2004 it completed the purchase of caricard a majority of the cash acquired with these acquisitions relates to game financial which provides check cashing and cash advance and atm services to the gaming industry in certain casino locations game financial maintains cash access booths where consumers can cash personal checks and various “pointofsale” devices where cash advance services are facilitated these pointofsale devices include pc’s kiosks and atm’s in other casino locations these transactions are conducted in the casino’s own cage operation by casino employees using game financial’s system 

  in september 2003 certegy used the net proceeds from the offering of 475 percent fixed rate fiveyear notes with a face value of 200 million to repay the outstanding indebtedness under its 300 million revolving credit facility at the same time certegy cancelled the 300 million facility and replaced it with a 200 million revolving credit facility which was used to meet working capital needs and to fund strategic acquisitions and periodic repurchases of shares when deemed appropriate there were no amounts outstanding on this facility at december 31 2005 

  on january 31 2006 the 200 million revolving credit facility was cancelled in connection with the merger and certegy entered into a 250 million unsecured interim term loan proceeds from this loan were used to provide the cash necessary to fund a 375 per share special cash dividend that was paid to certegy’s premerger shareholders and mergerrelated expenses the loan was repaid and cancelled on february 1 2006 using available cash and borrowings under the former fis credit facility which is described below 

  as of december 31 2005 certegy’s consolidated cash balance was 1380 million which includes the proceeds from the sale of the merchant acquiring business in 2005 net of amounts used to pay certain taxes due on the gain on the sale 

  cash flows from operating activities of the combined company are expected to be strong in 2006 and we expect capital expenditures for 2006 to approximate 225 million to 275 million 

44     we regularly evaluate cash requirements for current operations development activities and acquisitions we may elect to raise additional funds for these purposes either through further bank financing or the public capital markets as appropriate based on our recent financial results and current financial position we believe that additional funding will be available if required to meet our capital requirements 

   operating activities during 2005 certegy generated 1288 million in cash from operating activities compared to 1444 million in 2004 the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities is attributable to changes in assets and liabilities and income taxes paid in connection with the sale of the merchant acquiring business in 2005 which more than offset the increase in income from continuing operations adjusted for depreciation and amortization amortization of deferred compensation and other noncash charges 

  changes in assets and liabilities between years are driven by the timing of collections compared to billings trade accounts receivable and payments for vendor invoices income taxes interest and other thirdparty liabilities other current liabilities additional changes are attributable to the level of other receivables and other payables in our deferred debit processing services and cash access operations other receivables and other payables and the volume and timing of claims paid to merchant customers and claims recovered from check writers in our check guarantee business net claims accounts 

  net cash provided by operating activities includes a cash outflow of approximately 200 million for income taxes on the gain on the sale of the merchant acquiring business in 2005 proceeds from the sale of 600 million are presented in investing activities while income taxes paid on the gain on the sale are required to be presented in operating activities cash flows from discontinued operations excluding the cash flows related to the sale are shown separately in the statement of cash flows as cash provided by discontinued operations 

  other noncash items which are adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities include amortization of certain capitalized contract acquisition costs and deferred financing costs as well as net periodic benefit costs of retirement and postretirement benefit plans 

  outflows for other longterm assets primarily consist of the funding of employee life insurance premiums and deferred compensation plans incentive payments to customers related to signing or renewing longterm contracts and payments related to deferred data processing costs 

  certegy used cash flows from operating activities in 2005 primarily to repay revolving credit borrowings reinvest in existing businesses through expenditures for equipment and systems development and make dividend payments 

  investing activities capital expenditures in 2005 totaled 636 million which represents an increase of 227 million compared to the prior year expenditures for systems development and conversion of a large customer in the international card issuing operations incremental expenditures for systems development for operations acquired in the prior year and additional expenditures for domestic processing equipment and systems development for new products and services drove the increase in capital expenditures over the prior year proceeds from the sale of the merchant acquiring business totaled 600 million in 2005 while the acquisitions of game financial crittson and caricard in the prior year totaled 397 million which is net of cash acquired in 2005 certegy paid an additional 10 million related to the crittson acquisition as a result of the acquired business achieving specified levels of revenue growth during designated periods subsequent to the acquisition 

  financing activities net repayments of borrowings on the revolving credit facility in 2005 totaled 486 million compared to net additions to borrowings of 486 million in 2004 which were used to fund acquisitions and share repurchases cash expended for share repurchases totaled 965 million in 2004 dividend payments to shareholders totaled 125 million and 126 million in 2005 and 2004 respectively proceeds from the exercise of stock options totaled 249 million in 2005 compared to 113 million in the prior year 

45     discontinued operations cash provided by discontinued operations excluding the cash flows from the sale was 89 million in 2005 compared to 61 million in 2004 consisting of operating cash flows of 89 million in 2005 compared to 121 million in 2004 the decrease in operating cash flows is primarily driven by deferred income taxes for acquired merchant portfolios due to a change in the tax method of amortization in 2004 and the sale of the business in 2005 investing cash outflows in 2004 consisted of 02 million of capital expenditures and 58 million for the acquisition of the merchant acquiring portfolio of crittson there were no investing cash flows in 2005 

   operating activities during 2004 certegy generated 1444 million in cash from operating activities compared to 1318 million in 2003 the increase in net cash provided by operating activities is primarily attributable to the increase in income from continuing operations adjusted for depreciation and amortization amortization of deferred compensation and other noncash charges cash flows from discontinued operations are shown separately in the statement of cash flows as cash provided by discontinued operations 

  certegy used cash flows from operating activities primarily to reinvest in its existing businesses through expenditures for equipment and systems development as well as to repurchase shares make dividend payments and partially fund its acquisitions of game financial crittson and caricard 

  investing activities capital expenditures in 2004 totaled 409 million which represents a decrease of 28 million compared to the prior year capital expenditures in 2004 were primarily for processing equipment and software in the global card issuing operations and systems development for new products and services the acquisitions of game financial crittson and caricard totaled 397 million which is net of cash acquired 

  financing activities net borrowings on the revolving credit facility in 2004 totaled 486 million which were primarily related to the acquisitions and share repurchases certegy repurchased approximately 27 million shares of common stock in 2004 at a total cost of 965 million proceeds from the exercise of stock options in 2004 totaled 113 million compared with 55 million in the prior year dividend payments to shareholders which certegy began to pay in the fourth quarter of 2003 totaled 126 million in 2004 

  discontinued operations cash provided by discontinued operations was 61 million in 2004 compared to 15 million in 2003 consisting of operating cash flows of 121 million in 2004 compared to 63 million in the prior year and investing cash outflows of 60 million in 2004 compared to 47 million in 2003 the increase in operating cash flows is primarily driven by deferred income taxes on acquired merchant portfolios due to a change in the tax method of amortization which resulted in a tax deduction in 2004 investing cash outflows in 2004 consist of 02 million of capital expenditures and 58 million for the acquisition of the merchant acquiring portfolio of crittson investing cash outflows in 2003 consist of 02 million for capital expenditures and 45 million for the acquisition of a merchant portfolio 

   certegy revolving credit facility as discussed above certegy’s 200 million revolving credit facility was cancelled in connection with the merger and certegy entered into a 250 million unsecured interim term loan on january 31 2006 proceeds from this loan were used to provide the cash necessary to fund a 375 per share special cash dividend that was paid to certegy’s premerger shareholders and mergerrelated expenses the loan was repaid and cancelled on february 1 2006 using available cash and borrowings under the former fis credit facility which is described below 

  certegy also has a 100 million unsecured revolving credit facility that provides advances to finance its customers’ shortfalls in the daily funding requirements associated with its credit and debit card settlement operations outstanding borrowings on this credit facility are classified as part of the settlement payables in the consolidated balance sheets there were no amounts outstanding under this facility at december 31 2005 or december 31 2004 

46     former fis credit facility on march 9 2005 former fis completed a recapitalization plan former fis entered into 32 billion in senior credit facilities consisting of a 8000 million term loan a facility a 20 billion term loan b facility collectively the “term loan facilities” and a 4000 million revolving credit facility “revolver” with a consortium of lenders led by bank of america former fis fully drew upon the entire 28 billion in term loan facilities to consummate the recapitalization former fis used proceeds from the loans to repay the outstanding principal and interest on a 27 billion note it previously paid as a dividend to its parent fnf revolving credit borrowings and term a loans bear interest at a floating rate which will be at the borrowers’ option either the british bankers association libor or base rate plus in both cases an applicable margin which is subject to adjustment based on the senior secured leverage ratio of the borrowers the term b loans bear interest at either the british bankers association libor plus 175 per annum or at the borrowers’ option a base rate plus 075 per annum the borrowers may choose one month two month three month six month and to the extent available nine month or one year libor which then applies for a period of that duration interest is due at the end of each interest period provided that for libor loans that exceed three months the interest is due three months after the beginning of such interest period the term loan a matures in march 2011 the term loan b in march 2013 and the revolver in march 2011 the term loan facilities are subject to quarterly amortization of principal in equal installments of 025 of the original principal amount with the remaining balance payable at maturity as a result of these scheduled repayments and additional voluntary prepayments the aggregate principal balance of the term loan facilities was 25 billion at december 31 2005 in addition to the scheduled amortization and with certain exceptions the term loan facilities are subject to mandatory prepayment from excess cash flow which is reduced based on seniorsecured leverage issuance of additional equity and debt and sales of certain assets voluntary prepayments of both the term loan facilities and revolving loans and commitment reductions of the revolving credit facility are permitted at any time without fee upon proper notice and subject to minimum dollar requirements 

  the former fis credit facilities contain affirmative negative and financial covenants customary for financings of this type including among other things limits on the creation of liens limits on the incurrence of indebtedness restrictions on investments and dispositions limitations on dividends and other restricted payments and capital expenditures a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum secured leverage ratio 

  on march 9 2005 former fis also completed its minority interest sale in which it issued common shares representing a 25 interest in former fis to an investor group for 500 million former fis used the proceeds of that issuance and the remaining term loan proceeds to retire its former revolving credit facility and pay expenses relating to the recapitalization and the minority interest sale these expenses totaled 792 million and included certain fees and expenses of the investor group totaling approximately 457 million the remaining proceeds from the term loans and minority interest sale were retained to use for general corporate purposes 

  following the recapitalization former fis is highly leveraged as of december 31 2005 it is paying interest on the term loan facilities at a rate of one month libor plus 150 to 175 586 — 611 at that rate the annual interest on the remaining 18540 million of debt not swapped into a fixed rate obligation as described below would be 1128 million a one percent increase in the libor rate would increase its annual debt service on this portion of the term loan facilities by 188 million the credit rating assigned to the term loan facilities and revolver by standard  poor’s is currently bb 

  on april 11 2005 former fis entered into interest rate swap agreements which have effectively fixed the interest rate at approximately 61 through april 2008 on 350 million of the term loan b facility and at approximately 59 through april 2007 on an additional 3500 million of the term loan b facility the estimated fair value of the cash flow hedges results in an asset of former fis of 52 million as of december 31 2005 which is included in other noncurrent assets and as a component of accumulated other comprehensive earnings net of deferred taxes in former fis’s balance sheet 

  upon completion of the merger certegy became a coborrower under former fis’s senior credit facilities the facilities were amended to limit the amount of dividends the combined company can pay on its common stock to 60 million per year plus certain other amounts except that dividends on the common stock 

47   may not be paid if any event of default under the facilities shall have occurred or be continuing or would result from such payment

note this table excludes other obligations that we may have such as employee benefit obligations discussed in note 9 to the consolidated financial statements guarantees under our synthetic leases see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements and other current and longterm liabilities reflected in our consolidated balance sheets 

  the following table summarizes former fis’s significant contractual obligations and commitments as of december 31 2005 

   offbalance sheet arrangements note 10 to the consolidated financial statements also describes certain offbalance sheet arrangements in the form of synthetic leases and the change in accounting for one of the leases that was adopted on december 31 2003 in accordance with certain provisions of fin 46 other than facility leasing arrangements certegy has not engaged in offbalance sheet financing activities see former fis’s financial statements included as exhibit 992 to this filing for a description of its offbalance sheet arrangements 

  related parties prior to the merger transaction certegy did not have any material related party transactions see former fis’s financial statements included as exhibit 992 to this filing for a description of its related party transactions 

critical accounting policies 

  the preparation of certegy’s financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if 

 48     our significant accounting policies are described in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements we believe that the following accounting policies involve a higher degree of complexity and warrant specific description 

  reserves for card processing and check guarantee losses we recognize a reserve for estimated losses related to our card issuing and merchant acquiring businesses based on historical experience and other relevant factors in our card issuing business we record estimates to accrue for losses resulting from transaction processing errors we utilize a number of systems and procedures within our card issuing business in order to minimize such transaction processing errors in our recently sold merchant acquiring business we were a direct party to contracts with merchants regarding our provision of card processing services for the merchant if due to the insolvency or bankruptcy of the merchant or other reasons we were not able to collect amounts from our merchant customers for billing disputes resolved in favor of the cardholder referred to as a cardholder “chargeback” we had to bear the credit risk for the full amount of the cardholder transaction we required cash deposits and other types of collateral from certain customers to minimize any such risk in addition we utilized a number of systems and procedures to manage merchant risk and believe that the diversification of our merchant portfolio among industries and geographic regions minimized our risk of loss card processing loss reserves are primarily determined by performing a historical analysis of our loss experience and considering other factors that could affect that experience in the future such factors include the general economy and the credit quality of customers once these factors are considered we assess the reserve adequacy by comparing the recorded reserve to the estimated amount based on an analysis of the current trend changes or specific anticipated future events any adjustments are charged to costs of services these card processing loss reserve amounts are subject to risk that actual losses may be greater than our estimates we remain at risk for cardholder transactions in the merchant acquiring business conducted prior to the sale of the business at december 31 2005 and 2004 we had aggregate card processing loss reserves of 07 million and 09 million respectively which are included in other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets 

  in our check guarantee business if a guaranteed check presented to a merchant customer is dishonored by the check writer’s bank we reimburse our merchant customer for the check’s face value and pursue collection of the amount from the delinquent check writer loss reserves and anticipated recoveries are primarily determined by performing a historical analysis of our check loss and recovery experience and considering other factors that could affect that experience in the future such factors include the general economy the overall industry mix of our customer volumes statistical analysis of check fraud trends within our customer volumes and the quality of returned checks once these factors are considered we establish a rate for check losses that is calculated by dividing the expected check losses by dollar volume processed and a rate for anticipated recoveries that is calculated by dividing the anticipated recoveries by the total amount of related check losses these rates are then applied against the dollar volume processed and check losses respectively each month and charged to costs of services the estimated check returns and recovery amounts are subject to risk that actual amounts returned and recovered may be different than our estimates we had accrued claims payable and accrued claims recoverable balances of 295 million and 367 million at december 31 2005 and 362 million and 393 million at december 31 2004 respectively 

  historically such estimation processes have proven to be materially accurate however our projections of probable card processing losses check guarantee losses and anticipated recoveries are inherently uncertain and as a result we cannot predict with certainty the amount of such items changes in economic conditions the risk characteristics and composition of our customers and other factors could impact our actual and projected amounts we recorded card processing losses and check guarantee losses net of anticipated recoveries excluding service fees of 1471 million 1700 million and 1746 million respectively for the years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 a one percent increase in our card processing losses and check guarantee losses net of anticipated recoveries excluding service fees in 2005 would have reduced 2005 net income by approximately 09 million aftertax 

  valuation of goodwill and other longlived assets goodwill and certain other intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” “sfas 142” and all other longlived assets are tested for impairment in accordance with 

49   sfas 144 we regularly evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred which indicate that the carrying amounts of goodwill and other longlived assets property and equipment other intangible assets systems development and capitalized contract costs and other assets may be impaired or not recoverable significant factors that are considered that could trigger an impairment review include changes in business strategy market conditions or the manner of use of an asset underperformance relative to historical or expected future operating results and negative industry or economic trends in evaluating our longlived assets other than goodwill for possible impairment management estimates the asset’s future undiscounted cash flows to measure whether the asset is recoverable if it is determined that the asset is not recoverable we measure the impairment based on the projected discounted cash flows of the asset over its remaining life in the opinion of management goodwill and other longlived assets are appropriately valued at december 31 2005 and 2004 

  we make certain estimates assumptions and projections about our financial performance and our industry that affect the determination of the expected future cash flows used in our impairment tests while we believe that our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable these estimates are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from what is assumed in these impairment tests should we be unable to achieve certain of our business plans this could have a future impact on management’s opinion regarding the valuation of assets which could result in an impairment 

  income taxes we record income taxes in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 109 “accounting for income taxes” using the asset and liability method the asset and liability method requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for expected future tax consequences of temporary differences that exist between the tax bases and financial reporting bases of our assets and liabilities based on enacted tax rates expected to apply in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled a valuation allowance is provided against deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized at present all brazilian deferred tax assets are fully reserved in our valuation allowance brazil currently has approximately 446 million of net operating losses that are subject to restrictions on utilization no provision is made for us income taxes on undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries because those earnings are considered permanently reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries 

  in addition to estimating the future tax rates applicable to the reversal of tax differences management must also make certain assumptions regarding whether tax differences are permanent or temporary if the differences are temporary management must estimate the timing of their reversal and whether taxable operating income in future periods will be sufficient to fully recognize any gross deferred tax assets 

  for the years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 management made no material changes in its assumptions regarding the determination of the provision for income taxes during 2002 we determined that our investments in certain foreign subsidiaries are permanently invested and will not be repatriated to the us in the foreseeable future us tax consequences on the undistributed earnings of these subsidiaries are no longer considered in the tax provision calculation in accordance with apb opinion no 23 at december 31 2005 there are approximately 571 million of undistributed net earnings for which no additional us tax has been provided in 2004 the us enacted a onetime tax reduction on cash distributions of these undistributed foreign earnings which by election could apply in 2004 we did not make this election for 2004 but did distribute 04 million from foreign subsidiaries in 2005 which had a minimal impact on 2005 tax expense any future change in management’s plans regarding reinvestment of these earnings will require us to accrue for the additional tax impact of any amounts no longer permanently reinvested this accrual would be recorded at the time management determines that these earnings are no longer permanently reinvested 

  during 2005 we incurred ma costs of 112 million associated with the merger with former fis and the proposed brazilian joint venture a tax benefit for these costs was not recorded because the ultimate tax treatment of these costs cannot be determined with adequate certainty at this time this resulted in an increase in our 2005 effective tax rate of approximately two percentage points 

  certain events could occur that would materially affect our estimates and assumptions regarding deferred taxes changes in current tax laws and applicable enacted tax rates could affect the valuation of deferred tax 

50   assets and liabilities thereby impacting our income tax provision additionally significant declines in taxable operating income could materially impact the realizable value of deferred tax assets 

  for the year ended december 31 2005 our provision for income taxes from continuing operations was 689 million consisting of 606 million for current tax expense and 83 million for deferred tax expense our pretax earnings from continuing operations for financial reporting purposes have historically been higher than taxable income due primarily to tax deductions for amortization of goodwill amortization of software development and the special bonus depreciation allowance our pretax earnings for financial reporting were less than taxable income in 2004 due primarily to accelerated collection of accrued check guarantee claims and an increase in net employee benefit accruals changes in management’s estimates and assumptions regarding the enacted tax rate applied to deferred tax assets and liabilities the ability to realize the value of deferred tax assets or the timing of the reversal of tax basis differences could potentially impact the provision for income taxes a one percent change in the effective tax rate from 395 percent in 2005 to 405 percent would have increased the 2005 income tax provision by 18 million 

  employee benefit obligations the plan obligations and related assets of our defined benefit retirement and postretirement plans are presented in note 9 to the consolidated financial statements plan assets which consist primarily of marketable equity and debt instruments are valued using market quotations plan obligations and the annual net periodic benefit cost are determined by independent actuaries and through the use of a number of assumptions key assumptions in measuring the plan obligations include the discount rate the rate of salary increases and the estimated future return on plan assets in determining the discount rate we utilize the yield on highquality fixedincome investments currently available with maturities corresponding to the anticipated timing of benefit payments salary increase assumptions are based upon historical experience and anticipated future management actions the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets was made considering the plan asset mix historical returns on equity securities and expected yields to maturity for debt securities 

  for calculating retirement plan expense a marketrelated value of assets is used the marketrelated value of assets recognizes the difference between actual returns and expected returns over five years at a rate of 20 per year while the asset return and interest rate environment have impacted the funded status of our us retirement plan we do not currently have minimum funding requirements as set forth in erisa and federal tax laws we did not contribute to the plan in 2005 and do not anticipate contributing to the plan in 2006 information about the expected future employer contributions and benefit payments for our employee benefit plans are detailed in note 9 to the consolidated financial statements 

  net periodic benefit cost for our employee retirement and postretirement plans for the years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 were 62 million 39 million and 14 million respectively which includes 45 million 44 million and 43 million of expected return on plan assets 

  we have made certain other estimates that while not involving the same degree of judgment are important to understanding our financial statements on an ongoing basis management evaluates its estimates and judgments in these areas based on its historical experience and other relevant factors management’s estimates as of the date of the financial statements reflect its best judgment giving consideration to all currently available facts and circumstances as such these estimates may require adjustment in the future as additional facts become known or as circumstances change 

seasonality and inflation 

  we are subject to certain seasonal fluctuations such as peak activity during the holiday buying season we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our operating results however inflation could adversely affect our financial results were it to result in a substantial weakening in economic conditions that adversely affects the level of consumer spending 

51   economic and other factors 

  in fis’s financial institution processing business increases in deposit and lending transactions can positively affect our business and thus the condition of the overall economy can have an effect on growth while this business generally is not significantly affected by the cyclicality of real estate transactions our ability to expand our mortgage loan processing business is correlated to the total number of mortgage loans outstanding 

  fis competes for both licensing and outsourcing business and thus is affected by the decisions of financial institutions to outsource the services fis provides instead of simply licensing its applications as a provider of outsourcing solutions fis benefits from the greater revenues that result from a financial institution’s decision to outsource its processing to fis generally financial institutions of all sizes will consider outsourcing information technology and business process services to varying degrees although smaller financial institutions are more likely to outsource all information technology functions to companies such as fis since they generally do not have the staff budget or competencies to implement and operate highly complex technical environments larger financial institutions have historically chosen to limit outsourcing to specific application functions or services in connection with a particular product or operation such as mortgage processing generally demand for outsourcing solutions has increased over time as providers such as fis realize economies of scale and improve their ability to provide services that improve customer efficiencies and reduce costs 

  fis may be affected by the consolidation trend in the banking industry this trend may be beneficial or detrimental to the financial institution processing and mortgage loan processing businesses when consolidations occur merger partners often operate disparate systems licensed from competing service providers the newly formed entity generally makes a determination to migrate its core systems to a single platform when a financial institution client is involved in a consolidation fis may benefit by expanding the use of its services if they are chosen to survive the consolidation and support the newly combined entity conversely fis may lose market share if a customer of fis is involved in a consolidation and its services are not chosen to survive the consolidation and support the newly combined entity 

  the level of residential real estate activity which depends in part on the level of interest rates affects the level of revenues from our loan origination services business revenues from loan origination services increase as the amount of mortgage originations from both home purchases and mortgage refinancings increases during the second half of 2000 mortgage interest rates began to decline causing an increase in refinance activity this trend continued through the first six months of 2003 the increasing refinance activity coupled with record levels of residential resale and new home sales resulted in an exceptionally strong business climate for former fis’s mortgage origination services in 2003 declines in refinancings since 2003 have adversely affected our revenues in 2004 and 2005 from mortgage origination services 

  in contrast to the mortgage origination business fis believes that a higher interest rate environment may increase the volume of consumer defaults and thus favorably affect fis’s default management services business which provides services relating to residential mortgage loans in default the overall strength of the economy also affects default revenues 

  the level of residential real estate activity such as the number of residential resales new home sales and mortgage originations also affects revenues derived from many of the services provided by our information services businesses former fis experienced increased residential loan refinancing activity coupled with record levels of residential resale and new home sales during 2000 through 2003 while refinancing activity declined residential sales remained strong in 2004 and throughout 2005

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend   interest rates certegy has a synthetic lease obligation that has a variable interest rate and through the consummation of the merger an unsecured revolving credit facility that had a variable interest rate therefore we have exposure to the impact of interest rate fluctuations the risk was somewhat mitigated by our ability to fix the base libor rate for periods of up to six months on our revolving credit facility and by using interest 

52   rate swap arrangements in relation to our synthetic lease obligation there were no amounts outstanding under certegy’s revolving credit facility at december 31 2005 while the balance on our synthetic lease obligation at december 31 2005 was 224 million we have performed an interest rate sensitivity analysis assuming a 100 basis point increase in libor for our outstanding synthetic lease obligation and the increase in interest expense would not be material 

  former fis is highly leveraged as of december 31 2005 it is paying interest on the term loan facilities at a rate of one month libor plus 150 to 175 586 — 611 at that rate the annual interest on the remaining 18540 million of debt not swapped into a fixed rate obligation as described in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations would be 1128 million a one percent increase in the libor rate would increase its annual debt service on this portion of the term loan facilities by 188 million 

  foreign currency exchange rates approximately 164 percent of certegy’s consolidated revenues for the year ended december 31 2005 and 381 percent of its consolidated assets at december 31 2005 are associated with operations outside of the us the us dollar balance sheets and statements of income for these businesses are subject to currency fluctuations we are most vulnerable to fluctuations in the brazilian real and the british pound against the us dollar historically we have not entered into derivative financial instruments to mitigate this risk as it has not been costeffective the impact of currency fluctuations on profitability has not been significant since both revenues and operating costs of these businesses are denominated in local currency if the us dollar had a 10 percent higher appreciation against certegy’s nonus dollar denominated businesses consolidated revenues and operating income would have been reduced by 166 million and 12 million respectively in 2005 and 149 million and 13 million respectively in 2004 the cumulative translation adjustment largely related to certegy’s investment in its brazilian card processing operation was a 545 million and 586 million reduction of shareholders’ equity at december 31 2005 and 2004 respectively

 item 1 business 

  

references to “we” “our” “us” “the company” or “certegy” in this annual report on form 10k refer to certegy inc and its consolidated subsidiaries and with respect to periods prior to our spinoff from equifax inc in 2001 to our operations when we were a part of equifax unless in each case the context requires otherwise 

  

history 

  

certegy inc “certegy” provides credit card debit card and other transaction processing and check risk management services to financial institutions and merchants in the us and internationally our business is comprised of two segments card services and check services card services provides card issuer services in the us the uk brazil chile australia new zealand ireland thailand and the caribbean revenues of our domestic card issuer services business are primarily derived from independent community banks and credit unions while revenues of our international card issuer services business are generated from large and small financial institutions additionally card services provides merchant processing and ebanking services in the us and card issuer software support and consulting services in numerous countries in 2004 we serviced over 39 million card accounts worldwide check services provides check risk management services and related processing services in the us the uk canada france ireland australia and new zealand a significant portion of our check risk management services revenues are generated from several large national and regional retail chains in 2004 we authorized approximately 403 billion of check transactions worldwide 

  

originally founded as telecredit in 1961 our business pioneered the check risk management industry in the us and canada through the development of a centralized electronic database of consumer checkwriting histories telecredit delivered realtime check authorization decisions to merchants at the pointofsale through an acquisition in 1977 the business was expanded to include credit card processing subsequently we have added merchant processing debit card processing and ebanking services to our card services segment and check cashing risk management services and thirdparty check collections to our check services segment 

  

in 1990 equifax inc “equifax” acquired telecredit and continued to operate the card and check businesses through separate subsidiaries as its payment services division while part of equifax both card services and check services expanded outside of north america through a combination of joint ventures acquisitions and local startups 

  

on march 2 2001 we were incorporated under the laws of the state of georgia as a whollyowned subsidiary of equifax as “equifax ps inc” after equifax’s contribution of its payment services division to us and our adoption of the name certegy inc equifax “spun off” the businesses of the payment services division on july 7 2001 through a taxfree dividend of all of our outstanding shares of common stock to equifax’s shareholders of record as of june 27 2001 as a result of the spinoff we became an independent publicly traded company with the certegy shares of common stock registered and trading on the new york stock exchange under the symbol “cey”

discontinued operations 

  

our merchant processing operations consist of two businesses 1 merchant acquiring where we are a direct party to contracts with merchants regarding our provision of card processing services for the merchant and we are subject to the associated risk that a cardholder billing dispute will be resolved in favor of the cardholder referred to as a cardholder “chargeback” and 2 institution processing where we provide authorization settlement and customer service to community banks and others that contract directly with merchant customers we view merchant acquiring as a nonstrategic business and over the past few years have operated this business conservatively to reduce exposure to merchant risk which in the shortterm improved overall profitability but limited growth in september 2004 the board of directors of certegy approved a plan to sell our merchant acquiring business at which time the held for sale criteria in statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” “sfas 144” were met therefore our financial statements reflect the merchant acquiring business as a discontinued operation with the related assets and liabilities classified under the captions “assets held for sale” and “liabilities related to assets held for sale” in the consolidated balance sheets we expect that the merchant acquiring business will be sold within a year of approving this plan we plan to continue to operate the institution processing business which we believe is complementary to our card issuing business the merchant acquiring operations were historically included in the card services segment 

  

our operating segments 

  

card services certegy card services provides a full range of card issuer services that enable banks credit unions retailers and others to issue visa and mastercard credit and debit cards private label cards and other electronic payment cards for use by both consumer and business accounts additionally we process american express cards in australia and the caribbean our debit card services support both offline debit cards which are processed similarly to credit cards and online debit cards through which cardholders obtain immediate access to funds in their bank accounts through atms or merchant pointofsale terminals in the us our card issuing business is concentrated in the independent community bank and credit union segments of the market while internationally we service both large and small financial institutions we provide our card issuer services internationally through our processing centers in the us brazil chile the uk australia and the caribbean 

  

the majority of our domestic card issuer programs are full service including most of the operations and support necessary for an issuer to operate a credit and debit card program more specifically we process the card transactions on the cards issued by our customers including electronically authorizing the transactions capturing the transaction data and settling the transactions and we provide full service backoffice support functions for their programs these support functions include embossing and mailing our customers’ credit and debit cards to their cardholders customer service on behalf of the card issuers to their customers card portfolio management and analysis invoicing cardholders receiving and processing cardholder payments and delinquent account management services we do not make credit decisions for our card issuer customers nor do we fund their card receivables our services offer flexibility for those of our customers that require less than our full service programs such customers include large card issuing institutions that contract with us to provide transaction processing but who choose to invest the capital and human resources necessary to provide their own backoffice program support or use another vendor for such support 

  

our two most significant domestic customer segments independent community banks and credit unions consist predominantly of small and midsized card issuers that cannot independently achieve the economies of scale that would justify setting up their own credit and debit card operations we provide our card issuer services to these customers primarily through our longstanding contractual alliances with two associations representing independent community banks and credit unions in the us the independent community bankers of america the “icba” and card services for credit unions “cscu” these organizations offer our products and services to their respective members with our company as the provider these alliances allow us to utilize the marketing channels of icba and cscu to more effectively provide our offerings to individual credit unions and community banks as a result we believe we are the leading provider in terms of market share of comprehensive card processing services to credit unions and to independent community bank card issuers in the us 

  

over the past seven years we pursued growth in international markets through acquisitions in brazil chile and the caribbean and the startup of our card processing operations in the uk and australia in 2000 we entered into a fiveyear agreement with a multinational australianbased financial institution to process cards issued in australia new zealand the uk and ireland with operations commencing in the second quarter of 2001 this financial institution is serviced from our card processing operation in australia as well as from our card processing operation in the uk in 2003 we entered into an eightyear agreement with a thailand financial institution to process its visa and mastercard credit cards and unsecured personal loans this financial institution is also serviced from our card processing operation in australia card services plans to pursue further card processing opportunities in the asia pacific region utilizing our australian operation as the processing center 

  

card services also provides merchant processing services that enable retailers and other merchants to accept electronic payment cards in payment for goods and services our merchant processing operations consist of two businesses 1 merchant acquiring where we are a direct party to contracts with merchants regarding our provision of card processing services for the merchant and we are subject to the associated risk that a cardholder billing dispute will be resolved in favor of the cardholder referred to as a cardholder “chargeback” and 2 institution processing where we provide authorization settlement and customer service to community banks and others that contract directly with merchant customers as previously mentioned our board of directors approved a plan to sell our merchant acquiring business we expect that the merchant acquiring business will be sold within a year of approving this plan we plan to continue to operate the institution processing business which we believe is complementary to our card issuing business 

  

in december 1997 we began providing ebanking services to financial institutions enabling them to offer internet banking to consumers and businesses we provide these services either by licensing our products to our customers for their operation inhouse or as an application services provider or asp where the customers are linked to our central data center our retail internet banking services enable our bank customers to offer a wide array of internet based banking services to consumers such as electronic bill payment online account information and loan and account applications our corporate internet banking services enable our bank customers to offer their commercial customers various electronic commercial banking services including online account information bill payment funds transfers and other electronic services 

  

in order for us to provide our transaction processing services visa must designate us as a member service provider and for certain services as an independent sales organization of visa and we must be designated by mastercard as a member service provider to retain these designations we must be sponsored by member clearing banks of visa and mastercard and continue to comply with the standards of the visa and mastercard associations our products are affected by visa and mastercard electronic payment standards that are generally updated twice annually in addition our customers are subject to government regulations and industry standards with which our products and services must comply 

  

we intend to continue to expand our card processing business in the independent community bank and credit union segments of the market moreover our future growth and profitability will significantly depend upon our ability to penetrate additional international markets including emerging markets for electronic transaction processing our certification as an american express processor also provides further growth opportunities for us in the global card market 

  

in 2004 revenues from card services comprised 57 percent of our total revenues compared to 60 percent in 2003 and 62 percent in 2002 card services revenues as a percentage of our total revenues declined in 2004 compared to 2003 due to a shift in business mix of our check services segment and further diversification with the acquisition of game financial and continued expansion of our cash access services which we include in our check services segment the decline in card services revenues as a percentage of our total revenues in 2003 compared to 2002 was primarily due to the loss of a large customer in our merchant processing business which was acquired and moved its account to its new owner’s processor in the third quarter of 2002 and the loss of a large customer in our brazilian card operation which discontinued using our card processing services at the beginning of march 2003 

  

check services certegy check services provides check risk management and related processing products and services to businesses accepting or cashing checks at the pointofsale these services utilize our proprietary check authorization systems and risk assessment decision platforms a significant portion of our revenues from check risk management services is generated from several large national and regional merchants including national retail chains other customers of our check services segment include hotels automotive dealers telecommunications companies supermarkets casinos mail order houses and other businesses our services allow our clients to run their customers’ personal and business checks through an automated decisionmaking process that assesses the likelihood that a check will clear 

  

our check risk management services include solutions tailored to the specific needs of the customer they include welcome check® guarantee services where we accept the bad check risk associated with checks authorized by our system and welcome check verification services where our customers retain the risk we also provide blends of guarantee and verification services to meet specific customer needs all of these products utilize our proprietary system pathways ™  pathways provides the flexibility utilizing our risk management data and proprietary models to manage check acceptance risk by controlling the risk management parameters on a store by store or even a cash register by cash register basis 

  

in recent years we have introduced several new products for existing and new markets such as thirdparty check collections electronic check risk management solutions for pointofsale call center and electronic commerce applications and cash access services paycheck accept ™ enables retailers supermarkets and gaming establishments to reduce the risk of check losses and fraud in connection with their payroll check cashing services additionally we believe the acquisition of game financial on march 1 2004 helps position us as a leading provider of comprehensive cash access services in the gaming industry and broadens our check risk management product line and customer base 

  

we provide our check risk management products and services internationally in canada the uk ireland france australia and new zealand our principal product in all those countries is check guarantee services although mass retailers are beginning to utilize our check verification collection services and deferred debit processing services 

  

in 2004 revenues from check services comprised 43 percent of our total revenues compared to 40 percent in 2003 and 38 percent in 2002 check services revenues as a percentage of our total revenues increased in 2004 as compared to 2003 driven by a shift in business mix of our check services segment and further diversification with the acquisition of game financial and continued expansion of our cash access services which we include in our check services segment the growth in check services revenues as a percentage of our total revenues in 2003 compared to 2002 was primarily due to the loss of two large customers in our card services segment including a large customer in our merchant processing business which was acquired and moved its account to its new owner’s processor in the third quarter of 2002 and a large customer in our brazilian card operation which discontinued using our card processing services at the beginning of march 2003 

  

we believe check writing has begun to decline as a total percentage of pointofsale payments due in part to the growing use of debit and credit cards at the same time however demand for our services is high due to factors that include increasing sophistication of check fraud and higher concentration of bad checks written at the pointofsale due to a trend of higher credit quality consumers paying more with credit and debit cards and writing fewer checks these factors are contributing to a growing reliance of retailers and other businesses on outside vendors such as us to provide check risk management services 

  

for additional information relating to our business segments and operations within and outside the us see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this report 

  

our strategy 

  

we believe that the increased use of credit debit and other electronic payment cards around the globe will continue to present the card processing industry with significant growth opportunities we also believe that strong demand for check risk management services due to increased check fraud at the pointofsale and retailers’ growing reliance on third parties for assistance in accurately identifying good check writers to reduce bad check losses will continue to present us with growth opportunities 

  

in light of the market opportunities our strategic objective is to strengthen our position as a provider of card payment processing and check risk management services we intend to concentrate on the strategies summarized below to accomplish our objective 

  

further for both card services and check services we intend to continue to consider strategic alliances with investments in and acquisitions of domestic and international companies that would enable us to increase our penetration in our current markets enter new markets expand our technology expertise to help further enhance our processing risk management and ebanking services or to increase operating efficiencies 

  

card services 

  

utilize our competitive strengths in the us to further increase our share of revenue in the us credit and debit card markets including ebanking we believe those strengths include 

  

   

   

   

grow our customer base and processing volumes outside the us in international markets we will continue to focus our efforts 

  

on marketing to leading card processing prospects developing flexible processing services tailored to the diverse credit cultures in europe south america and asiapacific and utilizing our competitive advantages we believe these advantages include our strength in providing full service processing services and our proprietary card processing systems our proprietary systems are scalable and portable and have been customized to process in countryspecific environments in over 25 countries around the world we believe this customization enables us to enter new geographic markets quickly and inexpensively and helps position us to be a preferred vendor for outsourced card processing as this concept expands outside the us 

  

increase our revenues from our debit card processing products and services and from other existing and new products and services we intend to aggressively market our expanded debit card processing products and services and capture a larger share of the rapidly growing debit card markets in the us and abroad we also intend to aggressively market our card marketing services that assist our customers in growing their cardholder portfolios moreover we plan on developing and marketing internet service capabilities that will allow cardholders to manage their debit and credit card accounts and conduct electronic commerce more efficiently and effectively 

  

check services 

  

utilize our competitive strengths to increase our market share in the check risk management markets both in the us and internationally we believe those strengths include our advanced check risk management algorithms and systems our ability to introduce successful new check risk management products and our company’s existing operations and customer relationships in europe south america and asiapacific 

  

continue our development and utilization of increasingly sophisticated risk modeling tools to differentiate our capabilities from the competition these tools include proprietary algorithms and systems that we have developed independently and others that we have developed with our alliance partners 

  

expand further into existing markets and diversify into new markets such as cash access gaming grocery and government by leveraging our risk decisioning capabilities we take a very focused approach to new product and market development to ensure we identify and pursue opportunities that leverage our core competencies 

  

sales and marketing 

  

we market our products and services through a direct sales force and indirect sales channels such as icba and cscu independent sales organizations marketing alliances and financial institutions we organize our direct sales force by customer market segment or distribution channel additionally we market directly to our customers and indirectly through icba and cscu using print advertising and direct mail efforts we participate in major industry tradeshow and publicity events as many of our customers use a single product or service or a combination of products or services our direct sales force also targets existing customers to promote crossselling opportunities our strategy is to use the most efficient delivery system available to successfully acquire customers and build awareness of our products and services 

  

seasonality 

  

our business is somewhat seasonal the volume of card and check processing is highest during the holiday buying season and during other periods of increased consumer spending 

  

competition 

  

the market for our products and services is highly competitive we compete directly with thirdparty payment processors and companies that market software for the electronic payment industry we also compete against software and transaction processing systems developed and used inhouse by our potential customers our competitors in the card services segment include thirdparty credit and debit card processors including first data corporation total system services electronic data systems corporation and payment systems for credit unions and thirdparty software providers which license their card processing systems to financial institutions and thirdparty processors competitors in the check services segment include first data’s telecheck services division crosscheck efunds and global payments 

  

some of our competitors are privately held and the majority of those that are publicly held do not release the information necessary to precisely quantify our relative competitive position which varies depending on the segment of our markets based on information appearing in a widelycited industry publication the nilson report we believe that we are among the largest thirdparty payment transaction processors in the world based on annual volumes 

  

our markets are characterized by rapid technological change new product introductions evolving industry standards and changing customer needs in order to remain competitive we are continually involved in the development of new products and services these initiatives carry the risks associated with any new product development efforts including cost overruns delays in delivery and performance issues 

  

in general we believe that our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

significance of certain customer relationships 

  

revenues of our domestic card issuer services business are primarily derived from independent community banks and credit unions while revenues of our international card issuer services business are primarily generated from several large and small financial institutions a significant portion of our check risk management services revenues are generated from several large national and regional retail chains 

  

we have longterm contractual alliances with two associations representing independent financial institutions in the us the icba and cscu under these alliances card services is the exclusive partner for offering credit card issuer and merchant institution processing services to those associations’ members we are also the exclusive partner of cscu for offering debit card processing to its members as a result approximately 241 percent of our consolidated revenues in 2004 were derived from their member institutions although no single institution accounts for a material portion of our revenues an early termination of or significant adverse change in our relationships with either or both of these associations could harm our ability to retain a substantial portion of our customers and to attract new customers and have a material adverse effect on our business our contracts with the icba and cscu expire in 2008 and 2009 respectively 

  

research and development 

  

our research and development activities have related primarily to the design and development of our payment processing systems and related software applications and risk management platforms we expect to continue our practice of investing significant resources to extend the functionality of our proprietary processing systems and to develop new and innovative solutions in response to the needs of our customers in addition we intend to offer products and services that are compatible with new and emerging delivery channels 

  

intellectual property rights 

  

we rely on a combination of contractual restrictions and trademark copyright and trade secret law to establish and protect our trademarks software and expertise these legal protections and arrangements afford only limited protection of our proprietary rights and there is no assurance that our competitors will not independently develop or license products services or capabilities that are substantially equivalent or superior to ours we also license certain intellectual property from thirdparties those include rights under the ronald a katz technology licensing lp patents pertaining to various interactive technologies such as automated forms of customer service which rights continue through the life of the patents 

  

government regulation 

  

various aspects of our businesses are subject to federal state and foreign regulation our failure to comply with any applicable laws and regulations could result in restrictions on our ability to provide our products and services as well as the imposition of civil fines and criminal penalties 

  

as a provider of electronic data processing and backoffice services to financial institutions we are subject to regulatory oversight and examination by the federal financial institutions examination council an interagency body comprised of the various federal bank and thrift regulators and the national credit union association in addition we may be subject to possible review by state agencies that regulate banks in each state in which we conduct our electronic processing activities 

  

given that one of the databases that we maintain in the us contains certain data pertaining to the checkwriting histories of consumers and that data is used to provide certain check risk management services our check risk management business is subject to the federal fair credit reporting act and various similar state laws among other things the fair credit reporting act imposes requirements on us concerning data accuracy and provides that consumers have the right to know the contents of their checkwriting histories to dispute their accuracy and to require verification or removal of disputed information in furtherance of our objectives of data accuracy fair treatment of consumers protection of consumers’ personal information and compliance with these laws we maintain a high level of security for our computer systems in which consumer data resides and we maintain consumer relations call centers to facilitate efficient handling of consumer requests for information and handling of disputes 

  

our check collection services are subject to the federal fair debt collection practices act and various state collection laws and licensing requirements the federal trade commission as well as state attorneys general and other agencies have enforcement responsibility over the collection laws as well as the various credit reporting laws 

  

elements of our check cashing business are registered as a money services business and are subject to the usa patriot act and reporting requirements of the bank secrecy act and us treasury regulations this business is also subject to various state and local licensing requirements the financial crimes enforcement network state attorneys general and other agencies have enforcement responsibility over laws relating to money laundering currency transmission and licensing 

  

given that we conduct business in international markets as well as in the us we are subject to laws and regulations in jurisdictions outside the us that regulate many of the same activities that are described above including electronic data processing and backoffice services for financial institutions and use of consumer information 

  

although we do not believe that compliance with future laws and regulations related to our businesses including future consumer protection laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on our company enactment of new laws and regulations may increasingly affect the operations of our business directly or indirectly which could result in substantial regulatory compliance costs litigation expense adverse publicity andor loss of revenue 

  

employees 

  

as of december 31 2004 certegy had approximately 5300 employees including approximately 2000 employees principally employed outside of the us none of our us workforce currently is unionized we have not experienced any work stoppages and we consider our relations with employees to be good

certain factors affecting forwardlooking statements 

  

the statements in this report include forwardlooking statements that are based on current expectations assumptions estimates and projections about our business and industry they are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ significantly from what is expressed in those statements many of those risks and uncertainties are beyond certegy’s control the factors that could either individually or in the aggregate affect our performance include matters such as those described below 

  

we rely heavily on a small number of specific business segments for the majority of our revenues 

  

revenues of our domestic card issuer services business are primarily derived from independent community banks and credit unions while revenues of our international card issuer services business are primarily generated from several large and small financial institutions a significant portion of our check risk management services revenues are generated from several large national and regional retail chains the financial condition of these customers and their willingness to pay for our products and services are affected by general market conditions competitive pressures and operating margins within their industries the retailing industry is undergoing structural changes the effect of which on that industry and our business is uncertain any factors that adversely affect independent banks credit unions and retailers could adversely impact our revenues 

  

a significant portion of our business is derived from two key strategic relationships and a loss of either of those relationships could adversely affect our profits 

  

we have longterm contractual alliances with two associations representing independent financial institutions in the us the independent community bankers of america or icba and card services for credit unions or cscu under these alliances which expire in 2008 and 2009 respectively we are the associations’ exclusive partner for offering credit card issuer and merchant institution processing services to those associations’ members we are also the exclusive partner of cscu for offering debit card processing to its members as a result approximately 241 percent of our consolidated revenues in 2004 were derived from their member institutions an early termination of or significant adverse change in our relationships with either or both of these associations could harm our ability to retain a substantial portion of our customers and to attract new customers which would have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

our revenues from the sale of services to visa and mastercard organizations are dependent upon our continued visa and mastercard certification and financial institution sponsorship and the loss or suspension of this certification or sponsorship could adversely affect our business 

  

in order to provide our transaction processing services we must be designated a certified processor by and be a member service provider of mastercard and be designated as an independent sales organization of visa these designations are dependent upon our continuing adherence to the standards of the visa and mastercard associations the member financial institutions of visa and mastercard some of which are our competitors set the standards with which we must comply if we fail to comply with these standards our designation as a certified processor as a member service provider or as an independent sales organization could be suspended or terminated the termination of our member service provider status or our status as a certified processor or any changes in the visa and mastercard rules that prevent our registration or otherwise limit our ability to provide transaction processing and marketing services for the visa or mastercard organizations would result in the loss of business from visa or mastercard issuing customers and lead to a reduction in our revenues which would have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

we face chargeback liability if our merchants refuse or cannot reimburse chargebacks resolved in favor of their customers and we face liability to our merchant customers 

  

our merchant processing operations consist of two businesses 1 merchant acquiring where we are a direct party to contracts with merchants regarding our provision of card processing services for the merchant and we are subject to the associated risk that a cardholder billing dispute will be resolved in favor of the cardholder referred to as a cardholder “chargeback” and 2 institution processing where we provide authorization settlement and customer service to community banks and others that contract directly with merchant customers 

  

in our merchant acquiring business if we are unable to collect the chargeback amounts from our merchant customer’s account or if the merchant refuses or is financially unable to fund these amounts due to insolvency or bankruptcy or other reasons we must bear the credit risk for the full amount of the refund paid to the cardholder’s financial institution we require cash deposits and other types of collateral from certain merchants to minimize any such risk 

  

in addition we utilize a number of systems and procedures to manage merchant risk and believe that the diversification of our merchant portfolio among industries and geographic regions minimizes our risk of loss we recognize a reserve for estimated merchant credit losses based on historical experience and other relevant factors this reserve amount is subject to the risk that actual losses may be greater than our estimates 

  

as further discussed in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements in september 2004 the board of directors approved a plan to sell our merchant acquiring business we expect that the merchant acquiring business will be sold within a year of approving this plan 

  

we face liability to our merchant customers if checks that we have guaranteed are dishonored by the check writer’s bank 

  

if a check that we have guaranteed is dishonored by the check writer’s bank we must reimburse our merchant customer for the check’s face value and pursue collection of the amount from the delinquent check writer in some cases we recognize a liability to our merchant customers for estimated check returns and a receivable for amounts we estimate we will recover from the check writers based on historical experience and other relevant factors the estimated check returns and recovery amounts are subject to the risk that actual amounts returned may exceed our estimates and actual amounts recovered may be less than our estimates 

  

continued consolidation in the financial services and retail industries could reduce our customer base and reduce our revenues 

  

consolidation of our customers could result in a smaller market for our products and services after consolidation banks and other financial institutions and retailers may realign management responsibilities and reexamine strategic and purchasing decisions with potential adverse effects on demand for our products or services we may lose relationships with key constituencies within our customer’s organization due to budget cuts layoffs or other disruptions following a consolidation in addition consolidation may result in a change in the technological infrastructure of the combined entity our products and services may not integrate with this new technological infrastructure in addition the acquiring institution may have its own inhouse system or outsource to competitors 

  

a continued decline in check writing could adversely impact our profits within check services 

  

we believe check writing has begun to decline as a total percentage of pointofsale payments due in part to the growing use of debit and credit cards this decline has resulted in a higher percentage of bad checks at the point of sale because more higher credit quality customers are paying with credit and debit cards accordingly the demand for our check services by retailers and other vendors has increased at the same time as check writing percentages have declined to date this increased demand has offset the adverse effect of the decline in the percentage of payments by check however it is not likely that continued and prolonged declines in check writing can be offset by increased demands for services consequently a prolonged continuation of the decline in check writing could lead to a negative impact on the profitability of our check services segment 

  

our customers are subject to a regulatory environment and to industry standards that may change in a manner that reduces the number of transactions in which our customers engage and therefore reduces our revenues 

  

our customers are subject to a number of government regulations and industry standards with which our products and services must comply for example our products are affected by visa and mastercard electronic payment standards that are generally updated twice annually in addition action by regulatory authorities relating to credit availability data usage privacy or other related regulatory developments could have an adverse effect on our customers and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

demand for our products and services is sensitive to the level of consumer transactions generated by our customers and accordingly our revenues could be impacted negatively by a general economic slowdown or any other event causing a material slowing of consumer spending 

  

a significant portion of our revenue is derived from transaction processing fees any changes in economic factors that adversely affect consumer spending and related consumer debt or a reduction in credit and debit card use could reduce the volume of transactions that we process and have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

to remain competitive and grow our revenues we must continually update our products and services a process which could result in increased costs and the loss of revenues and customers if the new products and services do not perform as intended or are not accepted in the marketplace 

  

the credit and debit card transaction processing money transfer and check services markets in which we compete include a wide range of products and services including electronic transaction processing check authorization and other customer support services these markets are characterized by technological change new product introductions evolving industry standards and changing customer needs in order to remain competitive we are continually involved in the development of new products and services these initiatives carry the risks associated with any new product development effort including cost overruns delays in delivery and performance issues a delay in the delivery of new products or services could render them less desirable to our customers or possibly even obsolete in addition the products and services we deliver to the electronic payments market are designed to process transactions and deliver reports and other information on those transactions at very high volumes and processing speeds any performance issue that arises with a new product or service could result in significant processing or reporting errors as a result of these factors our research and development efforts could result in increased costs that could reduce our revenues and operating income if new products are not delivered timely to our customers or a loss of revenue or possible claims for damages if new products and services do not perform as anticipated 

  

to continue to grow profitably we must expand our share of the credit and debit card transaction processing market and enter new markets and the failure to do this could adversely affect our business 

  

our domestic card issuer business is concentrated in the independent community bank and credit union segments of the market and we have achieved a significant degree of penetration of these market segments while we intend to continue our vigorous pursuit of expansion within these segments our future growth and profitability will significantly depend upon our ability to penetrate other markets 

  

including emerging markets for electronic transaction processing such as international transaction processing and internet payment systems as part of our strategy to achieve this expansion we will continue to seek acquisition opportunities investments and alliance relationships that will facilitate our expansion however we may not be able to complete suitable acquisitions investments or alliances and if we do they may not provide us with the benefits we anticipated also we may not have adequate financial and technological resources to develop products and distribution channels that will satisfy the demands of new markets 

  

if the security of our databases is compromised our reputation could suffer and our business could be adversely affected 

  

we collect personal consumer data such as names and addresses social security numbers driver’s license numbers checking and savings account numbers and payment history records unauthorized access to our databases could result in the theft or publication of personal confidential information and the deletion or modification of personal records or otherwise cause interruptions in our operations these concerns about security are increased when we transmit information over the internet a security or privacy breach could 

  

   

   

   

   

any one or more of the foregoing occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

if we experience system failures the products and services we provide to our customers could be delayed or interrupted which could harm our business and reputation and result in the loss of customers 

  

our ability to provide reliable service largely depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operations of our computer network systems and data centers our systems and operations could be exposed to damage or interruption from fire natural disaster power loss telecommunications failure unauthorized entry and computer viruses although we have taken steps to prevent system failures we cannot be certain that our measures will be successful further our property and business interruption insurance may not be adequate to compensate us for all losses or failures that may occur any significant interruptions could 

  

   

   

   

   

any one or more of the foregoing occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

we may be liable for violating the intellectual property rights of third parties or have difficulties enforcing our own intellectual property rights 

  

our internet banking services money transfer and transaction processing services utilize significant proprietary software technology and other intellectual property we rely on a combination of intellectual property laws and confidentiality agreements to protect these rights these may not be adequate to protect all of our rights however in addition our intellectual property rights could be challenged or held unenforceable in a dispute with third parties third parties may independently develop similar or competitive technology that does not infringe our rights and we could not prevent its use 

  

we do not believe that our business infringes the intellectual property rights of others although we are currently a party to a patent infringement claim as described in part i item 3 – “legal proceedings” if the plaintiffs in an infringement lawsuit prevail including the one to which we are currently a party we may be forced to acquire a license to continue using the disputed intellectual property if one is even offered to us on reasonable terms we may also be forced to defend ourselves in infringement litigation which is costly regardless of the merits of the claim moreover we could be liable for money damages or be enjoined from using certain of our technology any of the foregoing occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

we plan to continue expansion of our international operations which will subject us to additional business risks and may cause our profitability to decline due to increased costs 

  

we believe that the international market for our products is growing rapidly and we expect to commit significant resources to expand our international sales and marketing activities as we expand internationally we will be increasingly subject to a number of risks and potential costs including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

we may not be able to overcome these barriers or avoid significant expenditures in addressing these potential risks 

  

foreign currency fluctuations may adversely affect us 

  

approximately 158 percent of our consolidated revenues for the year ended december 31 2004 and 373 percent of our consolidated assets at december 31 2004 are associated with operations outside of the us the us dollar balance sheets and statements of income for these businesses are subject to currency fluctuations we are most vulnerable to fluctuations in the brazilian real and the british pound against the us dollar the cumulative translation adjustment largely related to our investment in our brazilian card processing operation was a 586 million and 751 million reduction of shareholders’ equity at december 31 2004 and 2003 respectively 

  

economic conditions in brazil could adversely affect our brazilian operations 

  

economic conditions in brazil are uncertain which has created currency volatility and a major devaluation in the past resulting in severe inflationary pressures in addition significant changes in bank ownership as large private banks acquire smaller regional banks and foreign global banks acquire brazilian banks could result in the loss of customers these conditions make it challenging for us to develop our business and generate revenues in brazil see part i item 7—“management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—seasonality inflation and economic downturns” included elsewhere in this report 

  

our market is highly competitive and some of our competitors have substantially greater resources than we do 

  

we expect the market for our products and services to remain highly competitive our failure to remain competitive may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we face direct competition from thirdparty payment processors and companies that market software for the electronic payment industry we also compete against software and transaction processing systems developed and used inhouse by our potential customers our competitors may develop products and services that are superior to or that achieve greater market acceptance than our products and services the size of our competitors varies across market segments as do the resources we have allocated to the segments we target therefore certain of our competitors may have significantly greater financial technical marketing or other resources than we do in each of our market segments or overall as a result our competitors may be in a position to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or may devote greater resources than we can to the development promotion sale and support of their products and services 

  

moreover new competitors or alliances among our competitors may emerge and rapidly decrease our market share we may not be able to maintain our competitive position against current and potential competitors especially those with significantly greater resources than we have accordingly competitive pressures may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

completing and integrating acquisitions may be difficult 

  

as part of our growth strategy we routinely pursue acquisitions of companies whose businesses extend or complement ours we cannot however assure you that we will be able to successfully acquire suitable target companies on favorable terms or integrate these companies with our existing business if we complete an acquisition we cannot assure you that the acquisition will enhance our business results of operations or financial condition in the future we may require additional debt or equity financing for future acquisitions

overview 

  

we provide credit card debit card and other transaction processing and check risk management services to financial institutions and merchants in the us and internationally through two segments card services and check services card services provides card issuer services in the us the uk brazil chile australia new zealand ireland thailand and the caribbean additionally card services provides merchant processing and ebanking services in the us and card issuer software support and consulting services in numerous countries check services provides check risk management services and related processing services in the us the uk canada france ireland australia and new zealand 

  

card services card services provides a full range of card issuer services that enable banks credit unions retailers and others to issue visa and mastercard credit and debit cards private label cards and other electronic payment cards for use by both consumer and business accounts additionally we process american express cards in australia and the caribbean our debit card services support both offline debit cards which are processed similarly to credit cards and online debit cards through which cardholders obtain immediate access to funds in their bank accounts through atms or merchant pointofsale terminals in the us our card processing business is concentrated in the independent community bank and credit union segments of the market while internationally we service both large and small financial institutions we provide our card issuer services internationally through our operations in the us brazil chile the uk australia and the caribbean our merchant processing services enable retailers and other businesses to accept credit debit and other electronic payment cards from purchasers of their goods and services while our ebanking services enable financial institutions to offer internet banking and related products to consumers and businesses card issuing software support and consulting services allow customers to manage their credit card programs 

  

card transactions continue to increase as a percentage of total pointofsale payments which fuels continuing demand for cardrelated products we continue to launch new products aimed at serving this demand in recent years we have introduced a variety of storedvalue card types internet banking and electronic bill presentmentpayment products as well as a number of card enhancement and loyaltyreward programs the common theme among these offerings continues to be convenience and security for the consumer coupled with value to the financial institution 

  

over the past seven years we pursued growth in international markets through acquisitions in brazil chile and the caribbean and the startup of our card processing operations in the uk and australia in 2000 we entered into a fiveyear agreement with a multinational australianbased financial institution to process cards issued in australia new zealand the uk and ireland with operations commencing in the second quarter of 2001 this financial institution is serviced from our card processing operation in australia as well as from our card processing operation in the uk in 2003 we entered into an eightyear agreement with a thailand financial institution to process its visa and mastercard credit cards and unsecured personal loans this financial institution is also serviced from our card processing operation in australia card services plans to pursue further card processing opportunities in the asia pacific region utilizing our australian operation as the processing center 

  

we believe that the increased use of credit debit and other electronic payment cards around the globe will continue to present the card processing industry with significant growth opportunities we intend to continue to expand our card processing business in the independent community bank and credit union segments of the market moreover our future growth and profitability will significantly depend upon our ability to penetrate additional international markets including emerging markets for electronic transaction processing our certification as an american express processor also provides further growth opportunities for us in the global card market 

  

check services check services provides check risk management and related processing products and services to businesses accepting or cashing checks at the pointofsale these services utilize our proprietary check authorization systems and risk assessment decision platforms a significant portion of our revenues from check risk management services is generated from several large national and regional merchants including national retail chains other customers of our check services segment include hotels automotive dealers telecommunications companies supermarkets casinos mail order houses and other businesses our services allow our clients to run their customers’ personal and business checks through an automated decisionmaking process that assesses the likelihood that a check will clear we provide our check risk management products and services internationally in canada the uk ireland france australia and new zealand our principal product in all those countries is check guarantee services although mass retailers are beginning to utilize our check verification collection services and deferred debit processing services 

  

in recent years we have introduced several new products for existing and new markets such as thirdparty check collections electronic check risk management solutions for pointofsale call center and electronic commerce applications and paycheck accept ™  which enables supermarkets and gaming establishments to reduce the risk of check losses and fraud in connection with their payroll check cashing services additionally the acquisition of game financial corporation “game financial” on march 1 2004 helps position us as a leading provider of comprehensive cash access services in the gaming industry and broadens our check risk management product line and customer base 

  

we believe check writing has begun to decline as a total percentage of pointofsale payments due in part to the growing use of debit and credit cards at the same time however demand for our services is strong due to factors that include increasing sophistication of check fraud and higher concentration of bad checks written at the pointofsale due to a trend of higher credit quality consumers paying more with credit and debit cards and writing fewer checks these factors are contributing to a growing reliance of retailers and other businesses on outside vendors such as us to provide check risk management services 

  

key performance indicators management uses various key indicators to manage its business including revenue and operating income growth operating margin earnings per share growth number of cards and accounts on file and volumes processed 

  

comparability of financial results our financial results for 2003 were adversely impacted by the loss of a large customer in our merchant processing business which was acquired and moved its account to its new owner’s processor in the third quarter of 2002 and the loss of a large customer in our brazilian card operation which discontinued using our card processing services at the beginning of march 2003 in our check services segment our financial results in 2003 were adversely impacted by slow retail volumes due to general economic conditions and in addition incremental startup costs relating to our check cashing services business additionally the business developments described in the next section also affected the comparability of our financial results for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 

  

business developments 

  

discontinued operations our merchant processing operations consist of two businesses 1 merchant acquiring where we are a direct party to contracts with merchants regarding our provision of card processing services for the merchant and we are subject to the associated risk that a cardholder billing dispute will be resolved in favor of the cardholder referred to as a cardholder “chargeback” and 2 institution processing where we provide authorization settlement and customer service to community banks and others that contract directly with merchant customers we view merchant acquiring as a nonstrategic business and over the past few years have operated this business conservatively to reduce exposure to merchant risk which in the shortterm improved overall profitability but limited growth in september 2004 the board of directors of certegy approved a plan to sell our merchant acquiring business at which time the held for sale criteria in statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” “sfas 144” were met we plan to continue to operate the institution processing business which we believe is complementary to our card issuing business 

  

we have a number of potential purchasers who have expressed interest in our merchant acquiring business we are currently reviewing qualified offers we currently anticipate that the proceeds from the sale of this business will be used to pay down our revolving credit facility borrowings we could change the use of this cash for strategic acquisitions if deemed appropriate

as mentioned previously our merchant processing operations consist of two businesses merchant acquiring and institution processing in our merchant acquiring business where we are a direct party to contracts with merchants revenues collected for services are based primarily on a discount rate which considers the cost of interchange fees in our institution processing business where our relationship is with the financial institution that contracts directly with the merchant we collect the interchange fees in addition to transaction fees in both instances we are responsible for collecting the interchange fees after settling with the credit card associations and thus interchange fees are recorded as a component of revenues and costs of services in the consolidated statements of income interchange fees reflected in the consolidated statements of income for 2004 2003 and 2002 from continuing operations institution processing were 690 million 628 million and 860 million respectively

segment results 

  

the following table summarizes our segment results for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 

  

   

card services 

  

overview 

  

our card processing business in north america is concentrated in the community bank and credit union market segments we have longterm contractual alliances with two trade associations representing independent community banks and credit unions in the us the independent community bankers of america “the icba” and card services for credit unions “cscu” which expire in 2008 and 2009 respectively in 2003 we entered into a tenyear agreement with ibm to provide data processing and related services for our us operations which replaced an existing arrangement we had with eds we expect to achieve significant cost savings and future operational flexibility through this arrangement in march 2004 we acquired crittson a fullservice provider of card and merchant processing services 

  

card transactions continue to increase as a percentage of total pointofsale payments which fuels continuing demand for cardrelated products we continue to launch new products aimed at serving this demand in recent years we have introduced a variety of storedvalue card types internet banking and electronic bill presentmentpayment products as well as a number of card enhancement and loyaltyreward programs the common theme among these offerings continues to be convenience and security for the consumer coupled with value to the financial institution 

  

over the past seven years we pursued growth in international markets in september 1998 card services expanded its operations into south america by acquiring a 593 percent interest in our card processing operation in brazil and subsequently acquired the remaining 407 percent ownership in may 2001 in june 1999 we started a card processing operation in the uk owning a 51 percent interest and acquired full ownership in september 2000 in january 2000 we acquired procard a card processing operation in chile also in 2000 we entered into a fiveyear agreement with a multinational australianbased financial institution to process cards issued in australia new zealand the uk and ireland with operations commencing in the second quarter of 2001 this financial institution is serviced from our card processing operation in australia as well as from our card processing operation in the uk in 2003 we entered into an eightyear agreement with a thailand financial institution to process its visa and mastercard credit cards and unsecured personal loans this financial institution is also serviced from our card processing operation in australia card services plans to pursue further card processing opportunities in the asia pacific region utilizing our australian operation as the processing center in august 2004 we acquired caricard further expanding our card services in the caribbean 

  

as mentioned previously in september 2004 the board of directors approved a plan to sell our merchant acquiring business at which time the held for sale criteria in sfas 144 were met therefore our financial statements reflect the merchant acquiring business as a discontinued operation the results of operations are treated as income from discontinued operations net of tax and separately stated in the consolidated statements of income below income from continuing operations the merchant acquiring operations were historically included in the card services segment we plan to continue to operate the institution processing business which we believe is complementary to our card issuing business we expect that the merchant acquiring business will be sold within a year of approving this plan 

  

year 2004 compared with year 2003 

  

card services revenues of 5904 million in 2004 increased 396 million or 72 percent over 2003 primarily attributable to growth in north america card issuing the acquisitions of crittson and caricard and favorable currency trends which more than offset the 56 million decline in software revenue and the annualization of the loss of a large customer in our brazilian card operations in march 2003 the strengthening of certain foreign currencies against the us dollar increased our us dollar revenues by approximately 79 million in 2004 at december 31 2004 we were processing 489 million cards compared to 464 million at december 31 2003

merchant processing revenues from continuing operations of 818 million in 2004 increased 52 million or 67 percent compared to 766 million in 2003 driven by interchange passthrough revenue which more than offset the decline in revenue net of interchange fees due to change in mix of business and price modifications interchange passthrough revenue grew from 628 million in 2003 to 690 million in 2004 an increase of 62 million

merchant processing revenues from continuing operations of 766 million in 2003 decreased 251 million or 247 percent below the prior year the loss of a large customer in the third quarter of 2002 and lower debit interchange rates contributed to a reduction in interchange passthrough revenue from 860 million in 2002 to 628 million in 2003 a change of 232 million net of interchange passthrough revenues in 2003 were below the prior year by 20 million or 124 percent

check services 

  

overview 

  

we believe check writing has begun to decline as a total percentage of pointofsale payments due in part to the growing use of debit and credit cards at the same time however demand for our services is strong due to factors that include increasing sophistication of check fraud and higher concentration of bad checks written at the pointofsale due to a trend of higher credit quality consumers paying more with credit and debit cards and writing fewer checks these factors are contributing to a growing reliance of retailers and other businesses on outside vendors such as us to provide check risk management services in recent years we have introduced several new products for existing and new markets including payroll check cashing and thirdparty check collections also in march 2004 we acquired game financial a provider of debit and credit card cash advances atm access and check cashing services in gaming institutions

in conjunction with the spinoff from equifax we made a cash payment to equifax in the amount of 275 million in july 2001 to reflect certegy’s share of equifax’s predistribution debt used to establish our initial capitalization this payment was funded through 400 million of unsecured revolving credit facilities we obtained since that time we have used available cash flow to reduce our outstanding balance on these facilities and on september 10 2003 we used the proceeds from our offering of 475 percent fixed rate fiveyear notes with a face value of 200 million to pay down the remaining revolver balance 

  

on march 1 2004 we completed the purchases of game financial and crittson and on august 6 2004 we completed the purchase of caricard these acquisitions had a combined cash purchase price of 455 million net of 246 million of cash acquired and additional consideration adjustments settled during 2004 approximately 58 million of the crittson purchase price which represents the merchant acquiring operations was reclassified to discontinued operations see note 5 to the consolidated financial 

  

statements for further information we funded these acquisitions through borrowings on our revolving credit facility and as of december 31 2004 had 486 million outstanding on this facility a majority of the cash acquired with these acquisitions relates to game financial which provides check cashing and cash advance services for the gaming industry in certain casino locations game financial maintains cash access booths where consumers can cash personal checks and various “pointofsale” devices where cash advance services are facilitated these pointofsale devices include pc’s kiosks and atms in other casino locations these transactions are conducted in the casino’s own cage operation by casino employees using game financial’s system 

  

additionally we repurchased approximately 27 million shares of our common stock in 2004 at a total cost of 965 million in may 2004 our board of directors approved a 100 million share repurchase program at december 31 2004 we had 433 million remaining under this program 

  

cash flow from operations is expected to be strong in 2005 our cash needs for 2005 will be primarily related to capital expenditures and payment of dividends we expect our capital expenditures for 2005 to approximate 60 million to 65 million which includes approximately 8 million of spending that was previously expected to have occurred in 2004 as well as spending associated with new contract acquisition costs we plan to use a significant portion of our remaining available cash flow to repurchase our common shares however the extent of share repurchases could change based upon acquisition opportunities additionally we currently anticipate that the proceeds from the sale of our merchant acquiring business will be used to pay down our revolving credit facility borrowings however the use of this cash could also change based upon acquisition opportunities 

  

our revolving credit facility includes certain limitations on cash transfers amongst certegy and its subsidiaries additionally during 2002 we determined that our investments in certain foreign subsidiaries are permanently invested and will not be repatriated to the us in the foreseeable future us tax consequences on the undistributed earnings of these subsidiaries are no longer considered in the tax provision calculation in accordance with apb opinion no 23 any future change in management’s plans regarding reinvestment of these earnings will require us to accrue for the additional tax impact of any amounts no longer permanently reinvested this accrual would be recorded at the time management determines that these earnings are no longer permanently reinvested 

  

we regularly evaluate cash requirements for current operations development activities and acquisitions we may elect to raise additional funds for these purposes either through further bank financing or the public capital markets as appropriate based on our recent financial results and current financial position we believe that additional funding will be available if required to meet our capital requirements 

  

year 2004 compared with year 2003 

  

operating activities we continue to generate significant cash flows from our operating activities operating cash flows totaled 1448 million in 2004 which represents an increase of 130 million compared to 2003 the 2004 cash flow generated from net income was 1118 million adjusted for income from discontinued operations of 59 million depreciation and amortization of 474 million deferred taxes of 37 million and other amortization and noncash items of 145 million cash outflow from changes in assets and liabilities was 193 million as compared to 256 million in the prior year driven by improved cash flow for net claims accounts attributable to risk modeling technology and improved collections which reduced check guarantee net losses in 2004 and reduced cash outflow for other longterm assets offset by the impact of the timing of collections on receivables 

  

we used our cash flow from operating activities primarily to reinvest in our existing businesses through expenditures for equipment and systems development as well as to repurchase shares make dividend payments and partially fund our acquisitions of game financial crittson and caricard 

  

investing activities capital expenditures in 2004 totaled 409 million which represents a decrease of 28 million compared to the prior year capital expenditures in 2004 were primarily for processing equipment and software in our global card issuing operations and systems development for new products and services the acquisitions of game financial crittson and caricard totaled 397 million which is net of cash acquired 

  

financing activities net borrowings on our revolving credit facility in 2004 totaled 486 million which were primarily related to the acquisitions and share repurchases we repurchased approximately 27 million shares of common stock in 2004 at a total cost of 965 million proceeds from the exercise of stock options in 2004 totaled 113 million compared with 55 million in the prior year dividend payments to shareholders which we began to pay in the fourth quarter of 2003 totaled 126 million in 2004 

  

discontinued operations cash provided by discontinued operations was 61 million in 2004 compared to 15 million in 2003 consisting of operating cash flows of 121 million in 2004 compared to 63 million in the prior year and investing cash outflows of 60 million in 2004 compared to 47 million in 2003 the increase in operating cash flows is primarily driven by deferred income taxes on acquired merchant portfolios investing cash outflows in 2004 consist of 02 million of capital expenditures and 58 million for the acquisition of the merchant acquiring portfolio of crittson investing cash outflows in 2003 consist of 02 million for capital expenditures and 45 million for the acquisition of a merchant portfolio 

  

year 2003 compared with year 2002 

  

operating activities we generated significant cash flow from operating activities totaling 1318 million in 2003 an increase of 120 million compared to 2002 the 2003 cash flow was produced from net income of 924 million adjusted for income from discontinued operations and the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle charge of 39 million and 13 million respectively depreciation and amortization of 420 million deferred taxes of 138 million and other amortization and noncash items of 118 million cash outflow from changes in assets and liabilities was 256 million as compared to 254 million in the prior year 

  

we used our cash flow from operating activities primarily to reinvest in our existing businesses through expenditures for equipment and systems development we also used operating cash flows to repay temporary borrowings on our revolving credit facility and to fund treasury stock purchases 

  

investing activities capital expenditures in 2003 of 437 million decreased 52 million below the prior year period capital expenditures in 2003 were primarily for processing equipment and software in our global card issuing operations systems development for new products and services and capital investment for our check cashing program 

  

financing activities in september 2003 we completed our offering of 200 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured 475 percent notes priced to yield 482 percent due in 2008 the notes rank equally with all of our existing and future unsecured unsubordinated debt the notes were sold at a discount of 06 million which along with related note issuance costs will be amortized over the term of the notes we used the net proceeds from this offering to pay off the outstanding indebtedness under our 300 million revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes 

  

we repurchased 26 million shares of common stock during 2003 at a total cost of 736 million there were 796 million of common stock repurchases during the prior year period proceeds from the exercise of stock options in 2003 totaled 55 million compared with 159 million in the prior year period in august and november 2003 the board of directors approved a quarterly common stock dividend of 005 per share which were paid on october 15 2003 and january 15 2004 respectively the amount of the quarterly dividend paid in 2003 was 32 million 

  

discontinued operations cash provided by discontinued operations was 15 million in 2003 consisting of operating cash flows of 63 million and investing cash outflows of 47 million in 2003 for capital expenditures and the acquisition of a merchant portfolio compared to operating cash flows of 68 million in 2002 

  

general 

  

revolving credit facility in september 2003 we cancelled our 300 million revolving credit facility and replaced it with a new 200 million revolving credit facility which expires in september 2006 the new facility has substantially the same terms as the former facility except there are no subsidiary guarantees the new facility bears interest at an annual rate of libor plus 100 basis points and contains certain financial covenants related to interest coverage and funded debt to cash flow borrowings on the new facility are available to meet working capital needs and to fund strategic acquisitions and the periodic repurchase of shares when deemed appropriate the amount outstanding under the facility at december 31 2004 was 486 million there was no outstanding balance under this facility at december 31 2003 

  

we also have an unsecured revolving credit facility that provides advances to finance our customers’ shortfalls in the daily funding requirements associated with our credit and debit card settlement operations upon renewal of this facility in june 2003 we lowered the total available borrowing amount from 130 million to 100 million outstanding borrowings on this credit facility are classified as part of our settlement payables in the consolidated balance sheets there were no amounts outstanding under this facility at december 31 2004 or december 31 2003 

  

contractual obligations in 2003 we entered into a tenyear agreement with ibm which replaced our existing agreement with eds for us data processing services the transition from eds to ibm was completed in the third quarter of 2003 

  

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commitments as of december 31 2004 

  

 note this table excludes other obligations that we may have such as employee benefit obligations discussed in note 9 to the consolidated financial statements residual value guarantees under our synthetic leases see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements and other current and longterm liabilities reflected in our consolidated balance sheets 

  

offbalance sheet arrangements note 10 to the consolidated financial statements also describes certain offbalance sheet arrangements in the form of synthetic leases and the change in accounting for one of the leases that was adopted on december 31 2003 in accordance with certain provisions of fin 46 

  

other than facility leasing arrangements we do not engage in offbalance sheet financing activities we entered into synthetic operating leases in order to provide us with favorable financing arrangements with regard to the facilities subject to the leases the first synthetic lease on our madison wisconsin facility of 101 million was entered into in 1997 and the second synthetic lease on our st petersburg florida operations facility of 232 million was entered into in 1999 both of which expire in 2009 under these synthetic lease arrangements we have guaranteed the residual value of the leased properties to the lessors in the event the properties are sold by the lessors at the end of the lease terms we would be responsible for any shortfall of the sales proceeds under 262 million which approximates 79 percent of the value of the properties at the beginning of the lease terms based on the current fair market values of the leased properties we do not expect to be required to make payments under these residual value guarantees on december 31 2003 we adopted certain provisions of fin 46 which required us to consolidate our st petersburg florida operations facility in our consolidated financial statements 

  

as described in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements we have an interest rate swap arrangement in effect that fixes the interest rate for one of our variable rate synthetic lease obligations this derivative has been designated as a cash flow hedge was documented as fully effective and at december 31 2004 was valued as a liability totaling 12 million 

  

related parties we do not have any material related party transactions 

  

critical accounting policies 

  

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if 

  

   

   

our significant accounting policies are described in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements we believe that the following accounting policies involve a higher degree of complexity and warrant specific description 

  

reserves for card processing and check guarantee losses we recognize a reserve for estimated losses related to our card issuing and merchant acquiring businesses based on historical experience and other relevant factors in our card issuing business we record estimates to accrue for losses resulting from transaction processing errors we utilize a number of systems and procedures within our card issuing business in order to minimize such transaction processing errors from occurring in our merchant acquiring business if due to the insolvency or bankruptcy of the merchant or other reasons we are not able to collect amounts from our merchant customers for cardholder chargebacks we must bear the credit risk for the full amount of the cardholder transaction we require cash deposits and other types of collateral from certain customers to minimize any such risk in addition we utilize a number 

  

of systems and procedures to manage risk and believe that the diversification of our merchant customers among industries and geographic regions minimizes our risk of loss card processing loss reserves are primarily determined by performing a historical analysis of our loss experience and considering other factors that could affect that experience in the future such factors include the general economy and the credit quality of customers once these factors are considered we assess the reserve adequacy by comparing the recorded reserve to the estimated amount based on an analysis of the current trend changes or specific anticipated future events any adjustments are charged to costs of services these card processing loss reserve amounts are subject to risk that actual losses may be greater than our estimates at december 31 2004 and december 31 2003 we had aggregate card processing loss reserves of 09 million and 11 million respectively which are included in other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets 

  

as further discussed in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements in september 2004 the board of directors approved a plan to sell our merchant acquiring business therefore our financial statements reflect the merchant acquiring business as discontinued operations the portion of the card processing loss reserve related to the merchant acquiring business has not been reclassified to discontinued operations in the consolidated balance sheets as upon the ultimate sale of the merchant acquiring business we may retain the credit risk for cardholder transactions that we processed prior to the sale 

  

in our check guarantee business if a guaranteed check presented to a merchant customer is dishonored by the check writer’s bank we reimburse our merchant customer for the check’s face value and pursue collection of the amount from the delinquent check writer loss reserves and anticipated recoveries are primarily determined by performing a historical analysis of our check loss and recovery experience and considering other factors that could affect that experience in the future such factors include the general economy the overall industry mix of our customer volumes statistical analysis of check fraud trends within our customer volumes and the quality of returned checks once these factors are considered we establish a rate for check losses that is calculated by dividing the expected check losses by dollar volume processed and a rate for anticipated recoveries that is calculated by dividing the anticipated recoveries by the total amount of related check losses these rates are then applied against the dollar volume processed and check losses respectively each month and charged to costs of services the estimated check returns and recovery amounts are subject to risk that actual amounts returned and recovered may be different than our estimates we had accrued claims payable and accrued claims recoverable balances of 362 million and 393 million at december 31 2004 and 383 million and 465 million at december 31 2003 respectively we recorded card processing losses and check guarantee losses net of anticipated recoveries excluding service fees of 1700 million 1746 million and 1667 million respectively for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 

  

historically such estimation processes have proven to be materially accurate however our projections of probable card processing losses check guarantee losses and anticipated recoveries are inherently uncertain and as a result we cannot predict with certainty the amount of such items changes in economic conditions the risk characteristics and composition of our customers and other factors could impact our actual and projected amounts we recorded card processing losses and check guarantee losses net of anticipated recoveries excluding service fees of 1700 million 1746 million and 1667 million respectively for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 a one percent increase in our card processing losses and check guarantee losses net of anticipated recoveries excluding service fees in 2004 would have reduced 2004 net income by approximately 11 million aftertax 

  

valuation of goodwill and other longlived assets goodwill and certain other intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” “sfas 142” and all other longlived assets are tested for impairment in accordance with sfas 144 we regularly evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred which indicate that the carrying amounts of goodwill and other longlived assets property and equipment other intangible assets systems development and capitalized contract costs and other assets may be impaired or not recoverable significant factors that are considered that could trigger an impairment review include changes in business strategy market conditions or the manner of use of an asset underperformance relative to historical or expected future operating results and negative industry or economic trends in evaluating our longlived assets other than goodwill for possible impairment management estimates the asset’s future undiscounted cash flows to measure whether the asset is recoverable if it is determined that the asset is not recoverable we measure the impairment based on the projected discounted cash flows of the asset over its remaining life in the opinion of management goodwill and other longlived assets are appropriately valued at december 31 2004 and 2003 

  

we make certain estimates assumptions and projections about our financial performance and our industry that affect the determination of the expected future cash flows used in our impairment tests while we believe that our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable these estimates are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from what is assumed in these impairment tests should we be unable to achieve certain of our business plans this could have a future impact on management’s opinion regarding the valuation of assets which could result in an impairment 

  

income taxes we record income taxes in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 109 “accounting for income taxes” using the asset and liability method the asset and liability method requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for expected future tax consequences of temporary differences that exist between the tax bases and financial reporting bases of our assets and liabilities based on enacted tax rates expected to apply in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled a valuation allowance is provided against deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some or all of a deferred tax asset 

  

will not be realized at present all brazilian deferred tax assets are fully reserved in our valuation allowance brazil currently has approximately 30 million of net operating losses that are subject to restrictions on utilization no provision is made for us income taxes on undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries because those earnings are considered permanently reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries 

  

in addition to estimating the future tax rates applicable to the reversal of tax differences management must also make certain assumptions regarding whether tax differences are permanent or temporary if the differences are temporary management must estimate the timing of their reversal and whether taxable operating income in future periods will be sufficient to fully recognize any gross deferred tax assets 

  

for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 management made no material changes in its assumptions regarding the determination of the provision for income taxes except that during 2002 we determined that our investments in certain foreign subsidiaries are permanently invested and will not be repatriated to the us in the foreseeable future us tax consequences on the undistributed earnings of these subsidiaries are no longer considered in the tax provision calculation in accordance with apb opinion no 23 at december 31 2004 there are approximately 417 million of undistributed net earnings for which no additional us tax has been provided the us recently enacted a onetime tax reduction on cash distributions of these undistributed foreign earnings which by election could apply in 2004 we did not make this election for 2004 and at this time intend to keep our undistributed earnings reinvested in foreign operations any future change in management’s plans regarding reinvestment of these earnings will require us to accrue for the additional tax impact of any amounts no longer permanently reinvested this accrual would be recorded at the time management determines that these earnings are no longer permanently reinvested 

  

certain events could occur that would materially affect our estimates and assumptions regarding deferred taxes changes in current tax laws and applicable enacted tax rates could affect the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities thereby impacting our income tax provision additionally significant declines in taxable operating income could materially impact the realizable value of deferred tax assets 

  

for the year ended december 31 2004 our provision for income taxes from continuing operations was 621 million consisting of 656 million for current tax expense and 35 million for deferred tax benefit our pretax earnings from continuing operations for financial reporting purposes have historically been higher than taxable income due primarily to deductions for stock option exercises not included in pretax income for financial reporting amortization of software development and the special bonus depreciation allowance our pretax earnings for financial reporting are less than taxable income in 2004 due primarily to accelerated collection of accrued check guarantee claims and an increase in net employee benefit accruals changes in management’s estimates and assumptions regarding the enacted tax rate applied to deferred tax assets and liabilities the ability to realize the value of deferred tax assets or the timing of the reversal of tax basis differences could potentially impact the provision for income taxes a one percent change in the effective tax rate from 370 percent in 2004 to 380 percent would have increased the 2004 income tax provision by 17 million 

  

employee benefit obligations the plan obligations and related assets of our defined benefit retirement and postretirement plans are presented in note 9 to the consolidated financial statements plan assets which consist primarily of marketable equity and debt instruments are valued using market quotations plan obligations and the annual net periodic benefit cost are determined by independent actuaries and through the use of a number of assumptions key assumptions in measuring the plan obligations include the discount rate the rate of salary increases and the estimated future return on plan assets in determining the discount rate we utilize the yield on highquality fixedincome investments currently available with maturities corresponding to the anticipated timing of benefit payments salary increase assumptions are based upon historical experience and anticipated future management actions the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets was made considering the plan asset mix historical returns on equity securities and expected yields to maturity for debt securities 

  

for calculating retirement plan expense a marketrelated value of assets is used the marketrelated value of assets recognizes the difference between actual returns and expected returns over five years at a rate of 20 per year while the asset return and interest rate environment have negatively impacted the funded status of our us retirement plan we do not currently have minimum funding requirements as set forth in erisa and federal tax laws we did not contribute to the plan in 2004 and do not anticipate contributing to the plan in 2005 information about the expected future employer contributions and benefit payments for our employee benefit plans are detailed in note 9 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

net periodic benefit cost for our employee retirement and postretirement plans for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 were 39 million 14 million and 05 million respectively which includes 44 million 43 million and 43 million of expected return on plan assets 

  

we have made certain other estimates that while not involving the same degree of judgment are important to understanding our financial statements on an ongoing basis management evaluates its estimates and judgments in these areas based on its historical 

  

experience and other relevant factors management’s estimates as of the date of the financial statements reflect its best judgment giving consideration to all currently available facts and circumstances as such these estimates may require adjustment in the future as additional facts become known or as circumstances change 

  

new accounting pronouncements 

  

on december 16 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 123 revised 2004 “sharebased payment” “sfas 123r” which is a revision of sfas no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” “sfas 123” sfas 123r supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” “apb 25” and amends sfas no 95 “statement of cash flows” generally the approach in sfas 123r is similar to the approach described in sfas 123 however sfas 123r requires all sharebased payments to employees including grants of employee stock options to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 

  

sfas 123r must be adopted no later than july 1 2005 early adoption will be permitted in periods in which financial statements have not yet been issued we expect to adopt sfas 123r on january 1 2005 using the blackscholesmerton option valuation model 

  

sfas 123r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods 

  

   

   

we plan to adopt sfas 123r using the modified retrospective method restating all prior periods 

  

as permitted by sfas 123 we currently account for sharebased payments to employees using apb 25’s intrinsic value method and as such generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options accordingly the adoption of sfas 123r’s fair value method will have a significant impact on our results of operations although it will have no impact on our overall financial position we expect the impact of adoption of sfas 123r will reduce 2005 diluted earnings per share by approximately 008 to 009 and will result in an effective tax rate of 375 had we adopted sfas 123r in prior periods net income and earnings per share would have been reduced to the following pro forma amounts 

  

   

sfas 123r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption while we cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on among other things when employees exercise stock options the amount of operating cash flows recognized in prior periods for such excess tax deductions were 32 million 13 million and 38 million in 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively 

  

seasonality inflation and economic downturns 

  

we are subject to certain seasonal fluctuations such as peak activity during the holiday buying season we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our operating results however inflation could adversely affect our financial results were it to result in a substantial weakening in economic conditions that adversely affects the level of consumer spending 

  

the brazilian market is characterized by economic uncertainty that causes volatility in currency values and historically has resulted in severe inflationary pressures notwithstanding this uncertainty we believe that the longterm prospects offered by the brazilian market are attractive and our continued focus on growing our brazilian business and attaining cost efficiencies should provide us with a cost structure that can withstand shortterm declines in business driven by the uncertain market and the loss of a large customer in march 2003 

  

our brazilian operations had net assets of approximately 1102 million at december 31 2004 which includes a net equity reduction of 871 million as a result of cumulative foreign currency translation pursuant to sfas 142 and sfas 144 these assets are subject to regular evaluations to assess their recoverability in the opinion of management these assets are appropriately valued at december 31 2004 and 2003 however if we are unable to achieve our business plans and improve profitability in our brazilian operations by growing revenue or achieving the necessary cost efficient structure in the future this could have an impact on our opinion regarding the valuation of these assets which could lead to an impairment charge against net income 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

based on analysis completed and described below we do not believe that we are exposed to material market risk from changes in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates 

  

interest rates we have an unsecured revolving credit facility and a synthetic lease obligation that have variable interest rates therefore we are exposed to the impact of interest rate fluctuations this risk is somewhat mitigated by our ability to fix the base libor rate for periods of up to six months on our revolving credit facility and by using interest rate swap arrangements amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility at december 31 2004 were 486 million while the balance on our synthetic lease obligation at december 31 2004 was 224 million we have performed an interest rate sensitivity analysis assuming a 100 basis point increase in libor for our outstanding revolving credit facility borrowings and synthetic lease obligation and the increase in interest expense would be immaterial in 2004 and 2003 

  

foreign currency exchange rates approximately 158 percent of our consolidated revenues for the year ended december 31 2004 and 373 percent of our consolidated assets at december 31 2004 are associated with operations outside of the us the us dollar balance sheets and statements of income for these businesses are subject to currency fluctuations we are most vulnerable to fluctuations in the brazilian real and the british pound against the us dollar historically we have not entered into derivative financial instruments to mitigate this risk as it has not been costeffective the impact of currency fluctuations on profitability has not been significant since both revenues and operating costs of these businesses are denominated in local currency if the us dollar had a 10 percent higher appreciation against our nonus dollar denominated businesses consolidated revenues and operating income would have been reduced by 149 million and 13 million respectively in 2004 and 156 million and 06 million respectively in 2003 we may use derivative financial instruments in the future if we deem it useful in mitigating an exposure to foreign currency exchange rates the cumulative translation adjustment largely related to our investment in our brazilian card processing operation was a 586 million and 751 million reduction of shareholders’ equity at december 31 2004 and 2003 respectively

segment information 

  

card services certegy card services provides a full range of card issuer services that enable banks credit unions retailers and others to issue visa and mastercard credit and debit cards private label cards and other electronic payment cards for use by both consumer and business accounts additionally we began processing american express cards for a dominican republic bank in january 2003 which is serviced from our st petersburg florida processing center our debit card services support both offline debit cards which are processed similarly to credit cards and online debit cards through which cardholders obtain immediate access to funds in their bank accounts through atms or merchant pointofsale terminals in the us our card processing business is concentrated in the independent community bank and credit union segments of the market while internationally we service both large and small financial institutions we provide our card issuer services internationally through our operations in the us brazil chile the uk and australia 

  

the majority of our domestic card issuer programs is full service including most of the operations and support necessary for an issuer to operate a credit and debit card program more specifically we process the card transactions on the cards issued by our customers including electronically authorizing the transactions capturing the transaction data and settling the transactions and we provide full service backoffice support functions for their programs these support functions include embossing and mailing our customers’ credit and debit cards to their cardholders customer service on behalf of the card issuers to their customers card portfolio management and analysis invoicing cardholders receiving and processing cardholder payments and collection services we do not make credit decisions for our customers nor do we fund their card receivables our services offer flexibility for those of our customers that require less than our full service programs such customers include large card issuing institutions that contract with us to provide transaction processing but who choose to invest the capital and human resources necessary to provide their own backoffice program support or use another vendor for such support 

  

our two most significant domestic customer segments independent community banks and credit unions consist predominantly of small and midsized card issuers that cannot independently achieve the economies of scale that would justify setting up their own credit and debit card operations we provide our card issuer services to these customers primarily through our longstanding contractual alliances with two associations representing independent community banks and credit unions in the us the independent community bankers of america the “icba” and card services for credit unions “cscu” we have product offerings in place with each of these organizations which offer these products to their respective members with our company as the services provider these alliances allow us to utilize the marketing channels of icba and cscu to more effectively provide service offerings to individual credit unions and community banks as a result we believe we are the leading provider in terms of market share of comprehensive card processing services to credit unions and to independent community bank card issuers in the us 

  

card services also provides merchant processing services that enable retailers and other merchants to accept electronic payment cards in payment for goods and services we provide our merchant processing services both directly to retailers and other merchants who accept credit and debit cards and through contracts with financial institutions and others where our solutions enable them to service the card processing needs of their merchant customers these services include frontend authorization and data capture services backend accounting and settlement and dispute resolution services 

  

in order for us to provide our transaction processing services visa must designate us as a member service provider and for certain services as an independent sales organization of visa and we must be designated by mastercard as a member service provider to retain these designations we must be sponsored by member clearing banks of visa and mastercard and continue to comply with the standards of the visa and mastercard associations our products are affected by visa and mastercard electronic payment standards that are generally updated twice annually in addition our customers are subject to government regulations and industry standards with which our products and services must comply 

  

in december 1997 we began providing ebanking services to financial institutions enabling them to offer internet banking to consumers and businesses we provide these services either by licensing our products to our customers for their operation inhouse or as an application services provider or asp where the customers are linked to our central data center our retail internet banking services enable our bank customers to offer a wide array of internet based banking services to consumers such as online account information loan and account applications and electronic bill payment our corporate internet banking services enable our bank customers to offer their commercial customers various electronic commercial banking services including online account information bill payment funds transfers and other electronic services 

  

we intend to continue to expand our card processing business in the independent community bank and credit union segments of the market moreover our future growth and profitability will significantly depend upon our ability to penetrate additional international markets including emerging markets for electronic transaction processing our certification as an american express processor also provides further growth opportunities for us in the global card market 

  

in 2003 revenues from card services comprised 63 percent of our total revenues compared to 66 percent in 2002 and 67 percent 

  

in 2001 the decline in card services revenues as a percentage of our total revenues is primarily due to the loss of a large customer in our merchant processing business which was acquired and moved its account to its new owner’s processor in the third quarter of 2002 the loss of a large customer in our brazilian card operation which deconverted its portfolio at the beginning of march 2003 and the purging of merchants in our merchant processing business who no longer met our risk profile criteria in november 2002 

  

check services certegy check services provides check risk management and related processing products and services to businesses accepting or cashing checks at the pointofsale these services utilize our proprietary check authorization systems and risk assessment decision platforms a significant portion of our revenues from check risk management services is generated from several large national and regional merchants including national retail chains other customers of our check services segment include hotels automotive dealers telecommunications companies supermarkets casinos mail order houses and other businesses our services allow our clients to run their customers’ personal and business checks through an automated decisionmaking process that assesses the likelihood that a check will clear 

  

our check risk management services include solutions tailored to the specific needs of the customer they include welcome check ® guarantee services where we accept the bad check risk associated with checks authorized by our system and welcome check verification services where our customers retain the risk we also provide blends of guarantee and verification services to meet specific customer needs all of these products utilize our proprietary system pathways ™  pathways provides the flexibility utilizing our risk management data and proprietary models to manage check acceptance risk by controlling the risk management parameters on a store by store or even a cash register by cash register basis 

  

in recent years we have introduced several new products for existing and new markets such as thirdparty check collections electronic check risk management solutions for pointofsale call center and electronic commerce applications and paycheck accept ™  which enables supermarkets and gaming establishments to reduce the risk of check losses and fraud in connection with their payroll check cashing services 

  

we provide our check risk management products and services internationally in canada the uk ireland france australia and new zealand our principal product in all those countries is check guarantee services although mass retailers are beginning to utilize our check verification collection services and deferred debit processing services 

  

in 2003 revenues from check services comprised 37 percent of our total revenues compared to 34 percent in 2002 and 33 percent in 2001 the growth in check services revenues as a percentage of our total revenues is primarily due to the loss of two large customers in our card services segment including a large customer in our merchant processing business which was acquired and moved its account to its new owner’s processor in the third quarter of 2002 and a large customer in our brazilian card operation which deconverted its portfolio at the beginning of march 2003 additionally the purging of merchants in our merchant processing business who no longer met our risk profile criteria in november 2002 impacted our card services revenues in 2002 and 2003 

  

for additional information relating to our business segments and operations within and outside the us see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this report 

  

recent financial results 

  

our financial results for 2003 as compared to the prior periods have been adversely impacted by the loss of a large customer in our merchant processing business which was acquired and moved its account to its new owner’s processor in the third quarter of 2002 and the loss of a large customer in our brazilian card operation which deconverted its portfolio at the beginning of march 2003 although the loss of a customer in our merchant processing business had a significant impact on our revenues during the fourth quarter of 2002 and in 2003 it did not have a significant impact on our operating income in those same periods in addition our financial results have been adversely impacted by slow retail volumes in our check services segment due to the general economic slowdown and in addition incremental startup costs relating to our check cashing services business we have recently begun to notice an increase in guarantee volume in our check services business and we are continuing to experience strong growth in our card services segment other than in our merchant processing services and south american card issuer operations although management believes that positive developments such as these will help to offset the effect of the negative factors mentioned above there can be no assurance that those factors will not continue to have an adverse impact on our financial results 

  

our strategy 

  

we believe that the increased use of credit debit and other electronic payment cards around the globe will continue to present the card processing industry with significant growth opportunities we also believe that strong demand for check risk management services due to increased check fraud at the pointofsale and retailers’ growing reliance on third parties for assistance in accurately identifying good check writers to reduce bad check losses will continue to present us with growth opportunities 

  

in light of the market opportunities our strategic objective is to strengthen our position as a provider of payment processing and check risk management services we intend to concentrate on the following strategies to accomplish our objective 

  

   

utilize our competitive strengths in the us to further increase our share of revenue in the us credit and debit card markets including ebanking those strengths include 

  

   

   

   

grow our customer base and processing volumes outside the us in international markets we will continue to focus our efforts on marketing to leading card processing prospects developing flexible processing services tailored to the diverse credit cultures in europe south america and asiapacific and utilizing our competitive advantages these advantages include our strength in providing full service processing services and our proprietary card processing systems our proprietary systems are scalable and portable and have been customized to process in countryspecific environments in over 25 countries around the world this customization enables us to enter new geographic markets quickly and inexpensively and positions us to be a preferred vendor for outsourced card processing as this concept expands outside the us 

  

increase our revenues from our debit card processing products and services and from other existing and new products and services we intend to aggressively market our expanded debit card processing products and services and capture a larger share of the rapidly growing debit card markets in the us and abroad we intend to aggressively market our card marketing services that assist our customers in growing their cardholder portfolios we intend to develop and market internet service capabilities that will allow cardholders to manage their debit and credit card accounts and conduct electronic commerce more efficiently and effectively 

  

   

utilize our competitive strengths to increase our market share in the check risk management markets both in the us and internationally those strengths include our advanced check risk management algorithms and systems our ability to introduce successful new check risk management products and our company’s existing operations and customer relationships in europe south america and asiapacific 

  

continue our development and utilization of increasingly sophisticated risk modeling tools to differentiate our capabilities from the competition these tools include proprietary algorithms and systems that we have developed independently and others that we have developed with our alliance partners 

  

expand further into existing and new markets such as check cashing gaming grocery government and internet commerce by combining our current risk management and identity authentication services this combined solution provides us with the ability to effectively manage risk in environments where the consumer is not present as well as at the traditional pointofsale 

  

further for both card services and check services we intend to continue to consider strategic alliances with investments in and acquisitions of domestic and international companies that would enable us to increase our penetration in our current markets enter new markets expand our technology expertise to help further enhance our processing risk management and ebanking services or to increase operating efficiencies 

  

sales and marketing 

  

we market our products and services through a direct sales force and indirect sales channels such as icba and cscu independent sales organizations marketing alliances and financial institutions we organize our direct sales force by customer market segment or distribution channel additionally we market directly to our customers and indirectly through icba and cscu using print advertising and direct mail efforts we participate in major industry tradeshow and publicity events given many of our customers use a single product or service or a combination of products or services our direct sales force targets existing customers to promote crossselling opportunities our strategy is to use the most efficient delivery system available to successfully acquire customers and build awareness of our products and services 

  

seasonality 

  

our business is somewhat seasonal the volume of check and card processing is highest during the holiday buying season and during other periods of increased consumer spending 

  

competition 

  

the market for our products and services is highly competitive we compete directly with thirdparty payment processors and companies that market software for the electronic payment industry we also compete against software and transaction processing systems developed and used inhouse by our potential customers our competitors in the card services segment include thirdparty credit and debit card processors including first data corporation total system services electronic data systems corporation and payment systems for credit unions and thirdparty software providers which license their card processing systems to financial institutions and thirdparty processors competitors in the check services segment include first data’s telecheck services division efunds and global payments 

  

some of our competitors are privately held and the majority of those that are publicly held do not release the information necessary to precisely quantify our relative competitive position which varies depending on the segment of our markets based on information appearing in a widelycited industry publication the nilson report we believe that we are among the largest thirdparty payment transaction processors in the world based on annual volumes 

  

our markets are characterized by rapid technological change new product introductions evolving industry standards and changing customer needs in order to remain competitive we are continually involved in the development of new products and services these initiatives carry the risks associated with any new product development efforts including cost overruns delays in delivery and performance issues 

  

in general we believe that our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

significance of certain customer relationships 

  

revenues of our domestic card issuer services business are primarily derived from independent community banks and credit unions while revenues of our international card issuer services business are primarily generated from several large and small financial institutions a significant portion of our check risk management services revenues are generated from several large national and regional retail chains 

  

we have longterm contractual alliances with two associations representing independent financial institutions in the us the icba and cscu under these alliances card services is the exclusive partner for offering credit card issuer and merchant processing services to those associations’ members we are also the exclusive partner of cscu for offering debit card processing to its members as a result approximately 229 percent of our consolidated revenues in 2003 were derived from their member institutions although no single institution accounts for a material portion of our revenues an early termination of or significant adverse change in our relationships with either or both of these associations could harm our ability to retain a substantial portion of our customers and to attract new customers and have a material adverse effect on our business in december 2003 our contracts with the icba and cscu were extended into 2008 and 2009 respectively 

  

research and development 

  

our research and development activities have related primarily to the design and development of our payment processing systems and related software applications and risk management platforms we expect to continue our practice of investing significant resources to extend the functionality of our proprietary processing systems and to develop new and innovative solutions in response to the needs of our customers in addition we intend to offer products and services that are compatible with new and emerging delivery channels 

  

intellectual property rights 

  

we rely on a combination of contractual restrictions and trademark copyright and trade secret law to establish and protect our trademarks software and expertise these legal protections and arrangements afford only limited protection of our proprietary rights and there is no assurance that our competitors will not independently develop or license products services or capabilities that are substantially equivalent or superior to ours we also license certain intellectual property from thirdparties those include rights under the ronald a katz technology licensing lp patents pertaining to various interactive technologies such as automated forms of customer service which rights continue through the life of the patents 

  

government regulation 

  

various aspects of our businesses are subject to federal state and foreign regulation our failure to comply with any applicable laws and regulations could result in restrictions on our ability to provide our products and services as well as the imposition of civil fines and criminal penalties 

  

as a provider of electronic data processing and backoffice services to financial institutions we are subject to regulatory oversight and examination by the federal financial institutions examination council an interagency body comprised of the various federal bank and thrift regulators and the national credit union association in addition we may be subject to possible review by state agencies that regulate banks in each state in which we conduct our electronic processing activities 

  

given we maintain a database in the us containing the checkwriting histories of consumers and use that information to provide our check risk management services our check risk management business is subject to the federal fair credit reporting act and various similar state laws among other things the fair credit reporting act imposes requirements on us concerning data accuracy and provides that consumers have the right to know the contents of their checkwriting histories to dispute their accuracy and to require verification or removal of disputed information in furtherance of our objectives of data accuracy fair treatment of consumers protection of consumers’ personal information and compliance with these laws we maintain a high level of security for our computer systems in which consumer data resides and we maintain consumer relations call centers to facilitate efficient handling of consumer requests for information and handling of disputes 

  

our check collection services are subject to the federal fair debt collection practices act and various state collection laws and licensing requirements the federal trade commission as well as state attorneys general and other agencies has enforcement responsibility over the collection laws as well as the various credit reporting laws 

  

elements of our check cashing business are registered as a money services business and are subject to certain reporting requirements of the usa patriot act this business is also subject to various state and local licensing requirements the financial crimes enforcement network state attorneys general and other agencies have enforcement responsibility over laws relating to money laundering currency transmission and licensing 

  

given we conduct business in international markets as well as in the us we are subject to laws and regulations in jurisdictions outside the us that regulate many of the same activities that are described above including electronic data processing and backoffice services for financial institutions and use of consumer information 

  

although we do not believe that compliance with future laws and regulations related to our businesses including future consumer protection laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on our company enactment of new laws and regulations may increasingly affect the operations of our business directly or indirectly which could result in substantial regulatory compliance costs litigation expense adverse publicity or loss of revenue 

  

employees 

  

as of january 30 2004 certegy had approximately 4985 employees including 2021 employees principally employed outside of the us none of our us workforce currently is unionized we have not experienced any work stoppages and we consider our relations with employees to be good

certain factors affecting forwardlooking statements 

  

the statements in this report include forwardlooking statements that are based on current expectations assumptions estimates and projections about our business and industry they are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ significantly from what is expressed in those statements many of those risks and uncertainties are beyond certegy’s control the factors that could either individually or in the aggregate affect our performance include matters such as those described below 

  

we rely heavily on a small number of specific business segments for the majority of our revenues 

  

revenues of our domestic card issuer services business are primarily derived from independent community banks and credit unions while revenues of our international card issuer services business are primarily generated from several large and small financial institutions a significant portion of our check risk management services revenues are generated from several large national and regional retail chains the financial condition of these customers and their willingness to pay for our products and services are affected by general market conditions competitive pressures and operating margins within their industries the retailing industry is currently facing downturns in demand and structural changes in the industry we could experience declines in revenue as a result of any factors that would adversely affect independent banks credit unions and retailers 

  

a significant portion of our business is derived from two key strategic relationships and a loss of either of those relationships could adversely affect our profits 

  

we have longterm contractual alliances with two associations representing independent financial institutions in the us the independent community bankers association or icba and card services for credit unions or cscu under these alliances which were extended during december 2003 and which expire in 2008 and 2009 respectively we are the associations’ exclusive partner for offering credit card issuer and merchant processing services to those associations’ members we are also the exclusive partner of cscu for offering debit card processing to its members as a result approximately 229 percent of our consolidated revenues in 2003 were derived from their member institutions an early termination of or significant adverse change in our relationships with either or both of these associations could harm our ability to retain a substantial portion of our customers and to attract new customers which would have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

our revenues from the sale of services to visa and mastercard organizations are dependent upon our continued visa and mastercard certification and financial institution sponsorship and the loss or suspension of this certification or sponsorship could adversely affect our business 

  

in order to provide our transaction processing services we must be designated a certified processor by and be a member service provider of mastercard and be designated as an independent sales organization of visa these designations are dependent upon our continuing adherence to the standards of the visa and mastercard associations the member financial institutions of visa and mastercard some of which are our competitors set the standards with which we must comply if we fail to comply with these standards our designation as a certified processor as a member service provider or as an independent sales organization could be suspended or terminated the termination of our member service provider status or our status as a certified processor or any changes in the visa and mastercard rules that prevent our registration or otherwise limit our ability to provide transaction processing and marketing services for the visa or mastercard organizations would result in the loss of business from visa or mastercard issuing customers and lead to a reduction in our revenues which would have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

we face chargeback liability if our merchants refuse or cannot reimburse chargebacks resolved in favor of their customers and we face liability to our merchant customers if checks that we have guaranteed are dishonored by the check writer’s bank 

  

if a billing dispute between a merchant and a cardholder is not ultimately resolved in favor of the merchant the disputed transaction is “charged back” to the merchant’s financial institution and credited to the account of the cardholder if we are unable to collect the chargeback amounts from our merchant customer’s account or if the merchant refuses or is financially unable to fund these amounts due to insolvency or bankruptcy or other reasons we must bear the credit risk for the full amount of the refund paid to the cardholder’s financial institution we require cash deposits and other types of collateral from certain merchants to minimize any such risk in addition we utilize a number of systems and procedures to manage merchant risk and believe that the diversification of our merchant portfolio among industries and geographic regions minimizes our risk of loss we recognize a reserve for estimated merchant credit losses based on historical experience and other relevant factors this reserve amount is subject to the risk that actual losses may be greater than our estimates 

  

if a check that we have guaranteed is dishonored by the check writer’s bank we must reimburse our merchant customer for the check’s face value and pursue collection of the amount from the delinquent check writer we recognize a liability to our merchant customers for estimated check returns and a receivable for amounts we estimate we will recover from the check writers based on historical experience and other relevant factors the estimated check returns and recovery amounts are subject to the risk that actual amounts returned may exceed our estimates and actual amounts recovered may be less than our estimates 

  

continued consolidation in the financial services and retail industries could reduce our customer base and reduce our revenues 

  

consolidation of our customers could result in a smaller market for our products and services after consolidation banks and other financial institutions and retailers may realign management responsibilities and reexamine strategic and purchasing decisions with potential adverse effects on demand for our products or services we may lose relationships with key constituencies within our customer’s organization due to budget cuts layoffs or other disruptions following a consolidation in addition consolidation may result in a change in the technological infrastructure of the combined entity our products and services may not integrate with this new technological infrastructure in addition the acquiring institution may have its own inhouse system or outsource to competitors 

  

a prolonged and permanent decline in check writing could adversely impact our profits within check services 

  

we believe check writing has begun to decline as a total percentage of pointofsale payments due in part to the growing use of debit and credit cards a prolonged and permanent decline in check writing could lead to a negative impact on the profitability of our check services segment 

  

our customers are subject to a regulatory environment and to industry standards that may change in a manner that reduces the number of transactions in which our customers engage and therefore reduces our revenues 

  

our customers are subject to a number of government regulations and industry standards with which our products and services must comply for example our products are affected by visa and mastercard electronic payment standards that are generally updated twice annually in addition action by regulatory authorities relating to credit availability data usage privacy or other related regulatory developments could have an adverse effect on our customers and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

demand for our products and services is sensitive to the level of consumer transactions generated by our customers and accordingly our revenues could be impacted negatively by a general economic slowdown or any other event causing a material slowing of consumer spending 

  

a significant portion of our revenue is derived from transaction processing fees any changes in economic factors that adversely affect consumer spending and related consumer debt or a reduction in credit and debit card use could reduce the volume of transactions that we process and have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

to remain competitive and grow our revenues we must continually update our products and services a process which could result in increased costs and the loss of revenues and customers if the new products and services do not perform as intended or are not accepted in the marketplace 

  

the credit and debit card transaction processing and check services markets in which we compete include a wide range of products and services including electronic transaction processing check authorization and other customer support services the market is characterized by technological change new product introductions evolving industry standards and changing customer needs in order to remain competitive we are continually involved in the development of new products and services these initiatives carry the risks 

  

associated with any new product development effort including cost overruns delays in delivery and performance issues a delay in the delivery of new products or services could render them less desirable to our customers or possibly even obsolete in addition the products and services we deliver to the electronic payments market are designed to process transactions and deliver reports and other information on those transactions at very high volumes and processing speeds any performance issue that arises with a new product or service could result in significant processing or reporting errors as a result of these factors our research and development efforts could result in increased costs that could reduce our revenues and operating income if new products are not delivered timely to our customers or a loss of revenue or possible claims for damages if new products and services do not perform as anticipated 

  

to continue to grow profitably we must expand our share of the credit and debit card transaction processing market and enter new markets and the failure to do this could adversely affect our business 

  

our domestic card issuer business is concentrated in the independent community bank and credit union segments of the market and we have achieved a significant degree of penetration of these market segments while we intend to continue our vigorous pursuit of expansion within these segments our future growth and profitability will significantly depend upon our ability to penetrate other markets including emerging markets for electronic transaction processing such as international transaction processing and internet payment systems as part of our strategy to achieve this expansion we will continue to seek acquisition opportunities investments and alliance relationships that will facilitate our expansion however we may not be able to complete suitable acquisitions investments or alliances and if we do they may not provide us with the benefits we anticipated also we may not have adequate financial and technological resources to develop products and distribution channels that will satisfy the demands of new markets 

  

if the security of our databases is compromised our reputation could suffer and our business could be adversely affected 

  

we collect personal consumer data such as names and addresses social security numbers drivers license numbers checking and savings account numbers and payment history records unauthorized access to our databases could result in the theft or publication of personal confidential information and the deletion or modification of personal records or otherwise cause interruptions in our operations these concerns about security are increased when we transmit information over the internet a security or privacy breach may have any one or more of the following effects any one or more of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

   

   

   

   

if we experience system failures the products and services we provide to our customers could be delayed or interrupted which could harm our business and reputation and result in the loss of customers 

  

our ability to provide reliable service largely depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operations of our computer network systems and data centers our systems and operations could be exposed to damage or interruption from fire natural disaster power loss telecommunications failure unauthorized entry and computer viruses although we have taken steps to prevent system failures we cannot be certain that our measures will be successful further our property and business interruption insurance may not be adequate to compensate us for all losses or failures that may occur any significant interruptions could 

  

   

   

   

   

any one or more of the foregoing occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

we may be liable for violating the intellectual property rights of third parties or have difficulties enforcing our own intellectual property rights 

  

our internet banking services and transaction processing services utilize significant proprietary software technology and other intellectual property we rely on a combination of intellectual property laws and confidentiality agreements to protect these rights these 

  

may not be adequate to protect all of our rights however in addition our intellectual property rights could be challenged or held unenforceable in any dispute with third parties third parties may independently develop similar or competitive technology that does not infringe our rights and we could not prevent its use we do not believe that our business infringes the intellectual property rights of others 

  

nonetheless a third party may in the future bring a lawsuit for infringement against us in such case we may be forced to acquire a license to continue using the disputed intellectual property if one is even offered to us on reasonable terms we may also be forced to defend ourselves in infringement litigation which is costly regardless of the merits of the claim if we did not prevail in any such litigation we could be liable for money damages or be enjoined from using certain of our technology 

  

any of the foregoing occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

we plan to continue expansion of our international operations which will subject us to additional business risks and may cause our profitability to decline due to increased costs 

  

we believe that the international market for our products is growing rapidly and we expect to commit significant resources to expand our international sales and marketing activities as we expand internationally we will be increasingly subject to a number of risks and potential costs including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

we may not be able to overcome these barriers or avoid significant expenditures in addressing these potential risks 

  

foreign currency fluctuations may adversely affect us 

  

approximately 155 percent of our consolidated revenues for the year ended december 31 2003 and 359 percent of our consolidated assets at december 31 2003 are associated with operations outside of the us the us dollar balance sheets and statements of income for these businesses are subject to currency fluctuations we are most vulnerable to fluctuations in the brazilian real and the british pound against the us dollar the cumulative translation adjustment largely related to our investment in our brazilian card processing operation was a 751 million and 1134 million reduction of shareholders’ equity at december 31 2003 and 2002 respectively 

  

negative economic and difficult political conditions in brazil could adversely affect our brazilian operations 

  

economic and political conditions in brazil are uncertain and volatile which could adversely affect our brazilian operations the currency of brazil has experienced volatility and a major devaluation which historically has resulted in severe inflationary pressures in addition significant changes in bank ownership as large private banks acquire smaller regional banks and foreign global banks acquire brazilian banks could result in the loss of customers these conditions make it challenging for us to develop our business and generate revenues in brazil see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations— seasonality inflation and economic downturns” included elsewhere in this report 

  

our market is highly competitive and some of our competitors have substantially greater resources than we do 

  

we expect the market for our products and services to remain highly competitive our failure to remain competitive may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we face direct competition from thirdparty payment processors and companies that market software for the electronic payment industry we also compete against software and transaction processing systems developed and used inhouse by our potential customers our competitors may develop products and services that are superior to or that achieve greater market acceptance than our products and services the sizes of competitors vary across market 

  

segments as do the resources we have allocated to the segments we target therefore certain of our competitors may have significantly greater financial technical marketing or other resources than we do in each of our market segments or overall as a result our competitors may be in a position to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or may devote greater resources than we can to the development promotion sale and support of their products and services moreover new competitors or alliances among our competitors may emerge and rapidly decrease our market share we may not be able to maintain our competitive position against current and potential competitors especially those with significantly greater resources than we have accordingly competitive pressures may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with item 6 selected financial data item 8 financial statements and supplementary data and exhibit 991 nongaap consolidated statement of income for the year ended december 31 2001 included elsewhere in this report 

  

overview 

  

we provide credit and debit card processing and check risk management services to financial institutions and merchants in the us and internationally through two segments card services and check services card services provides card issuing services in the us the uk brazil chile australia new zealand ireland thailand and the dominican republic additionally card services provides merchant processing and ebanking services in the us and card issuing software support and consulting services in numerous countries check services provides check risk management services and related processing services in the us the uk canada france ireland australia and new zealand 

  

card services card services provides a full range of card issuer services that enable banks credit unions retailers and others to issue visa and mastercard credit and debit cards private label cards and other electronic payment cards for use by both consumer and business accounts additionally we began processing american express cards for a dominican republic bank in january 2003 which is serviced from our st petersburg florida processing center our debit card services support both offline debit cards which are processed similarly to credit cards and online debit cards through which cardholders obtain immediate access to funds in their bank accounts 

  

through atms or merchant pointofsale terminals in the us our card processing business is concentrated in the independent community bank and credit union segments of the market while internationally we service both large and small financial institutions we provide our card issuer services internationally through our operations in the us brazil chile the uk and australia our merchant processing services enable retailers and other businesses to accept credit debit and other electronic payment cards from purchasers of their goods and services while our ebanking services enable financial institutions to offer internet banking and related products to consumers and businesses card issuing software support and consulting services allow customers to manage their credit card programs 

  

card transactions continue to increase as a percentage of total pointofsale payments which fuels continuing demand for cardrelated products we continue to launch new products aimed at serving this demand in recent years we have introduced a variety of storedvalue card types internet banking and electronic bill presentmentpayment products as well as a number of card enhancement and loyaltyreward programs the common theme among these offerings continues to be convenience and security for the consumer coupled with value to the financial institution over the past six years we pursued growth in international markets through acquisitions in brazil and chile and the startup of our card processing operations in the uk and australia in 2000 we entered into a fiveyear agreement with a multinational australianbased financial institution to process cards issued in australia new zealand the uk and ireland with operations commencing in the second quarter of 2001 this financial institution is serviced from our card processing operation in australia as well as from our card processing operation in the uk in 2003 we entered into an eightyear agreement with a thailand financial institution whereby it will outsource the processing of its visa and mastercard credit cards and unsecured personal loans this financial institution is also serviced from our card processing operation in australia card services plans to pursue further card processing opportunities in the asia pacific region utilizing our australian operation as the processing center 

  

we believe that the increased use of credit debit and other electronic payment cards around the globe will continue to present the card processing industry with significant growth opportunities we intend to continue to expand our card processing business in the independent community bank and credit union segments of the market moreover our future growth and profitability will significantly depend upon our ability to penetrate additional international markets including emerging markets for electronic transaction processing our certification as an american express processor also provides further growth opportunities for us in the global card market 

  

check services check services provides check risk management and related processing products and services to businesses accepting or cashing checks at the pointofsale these services utilize our proprietary check authorization systems and risk assessment decision platforms a significant portion of our revenues from check risk management services is generated from several large national and regional merchants including national retail chains other customers of our check services segment include hotels automotive dealers telecommunications companies supermarkets casinos mail order houses and other businesses our services allow our clients to run their customers’ personal and business checks through an automated decisionmaking process that assesses the likelihood that a check will clear we provide our check risk management products and services internationally in canada the uk ireland france australia and new zealand our principal product in all those countries is check guarantee services although mass retailers are beginning to utilize our check verification collection services and deferred debit processing services 

  

in recent years we have introduced several new products for existing and new markets such as thirdparty check collections electronic check risk management solutions for pointofsale call center and electronic commerce applications and paycheck accept ™  which enables supermarkets and gaming establishments to reduce the risk of check losses and fraud in connection with their payroll check cashing services 

  

we believe check writing has begun to decline as a total percentage of pointofsale payments due in part to the growing use of debit and credit cards at the same time however demand for our services is strong due to factors that include increasing sophistication of check fraud and higher concentration of bad checks written at the pointofsale due to a trend of higher credit quality consumers paying more with credit and debit cards and writing fewer checks these factors are contributing to a growing reliance of retailers and other businesses on outside vendors such as us to provide check risk management services 

  

key performance indicators management uses various key indicators to manage its business including revenue and operating income growth operating margin earnings per share growth number of cards and accounts on file and volumes processed 

  

comparability of financial results our financial results for 2003 as compared to the prior periods have been adversely impacted by the loss of a large customer in our merchant processing business which was acquired and moved its account to its new owner’s processor in the third quarter of 2002 and the loss of a large customer in our brazilian card operation which deconverted its portfolio at the beginning of march 2003 although the loss of a customer in our merchant processing business had a significant impact on our revenues during the fourth quarter of 2002 and in 2003 it did not have a significant impact on our operating income in those same periods in addition our financial results have been adversely impacted by slow retail volumes in our check services segment due to the general economic slowdown and in addition incremental startup costs relating to our check cashing services business we have recently begun to notice an increase in guarantee volume in our check services business and we are continuing to experience strong growth in our card services segment other than in our merchant processing services and south american card issuer operations although management believes that positive developments such as these will help to offset the effect of the negative factors mentioned above there can be no assurance that those factors will not continue to have an adverse impact on our financial results 

  

business developments 

  

200 million note offering in september 2003 we completed our offering of 200 million aggregate principal amount of 475 percent senior unsecured notes which mature in september 2008 the proceeds from this offering were used to pay off the outstanding indebtedness under our 300 million revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for further information 

  

adoption of fin 46 on december 31 2003 we adopted certain provisions of financial accounting standards board interpretation no 46 “consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 51” “fin 46” as required for the synthetic lease on our st petersburg florida facility in conjunction with the adoption of fin 46 we recognized a cumulative effect of accounting change expense of 13 million aftertax or 002 per diluted share additionally we recorded property and equipment of 210 million which is net of accumulated depreciation deferred income tax assets of 08 million longterm notes payable of 224 million and a minority interest liability of 08 million which is included in other longterm liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet see notes 2 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements for further information 

  

share repurchase authority in august 2003 the board of directors increased our remaining share repurchase authority to 100 million as of december 31 2003 we had approximately 401 million remaining authority for share repurchases 

  

dividends in august 2003 the board of directors approved an initial quarterly common stock dividend of 005 per share or 32 million which was paid on october 15 2003 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on october 1 2003 additionally in november 2003 the board of directors approved a quarterly common stock dividend of 005 per share or 32 million which was paid on january 15 2004 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on january 1 2004

acquisitions in may 2001 we acquired the remaining 407 percent minority interest in our card processing operation in brazil for 555 million in cash we previously held a 593 percent controlling interest in this operation which we acquired in 1998 in august 2001 we acquired accu chek inc “accu chek” a leading provider of thirdparty check collection services in the us for 235 million in cash which is net of 15 million of cash acquired on december 31 2002 we acquired the majority of assets and liabilities of netzee inc “netzee” a provider of ebanking services to community banks and credit unions in the us for 104 million in cash in september 2003 we acquired a merchant portfolio for 45 million in cash 

  

spinoff from equifax in 2001 on july 7 2001 our spinoff from equifax inc “equifax” was completed by consolidating all of the assets and liabilities of the businesses that comprised equifax’s payment services division into certegy and its subsidiaries and then distributing all of certegy’s outstanding common stock to equifax shareholders “the distribution” for the period prior to the distribution the consolidated financial statements present our financial position results of operations and cash flows as derived from equifax’s historical financial statements included in these historical financial statements are certain equifax corporate expenses that were allocated to us utilizing such factors as revenues number of employees and other relevant factors we believe these allocations were made on a reasonable basis however we believe that had we been operating on a full year standalone basis we would have incurred additional expenses of approximately 32 million in 2001 for the period prior to the distribution 

  

in conjunction with the distribution we incurred 275 million of debt to fund a payment in that amount to equifax the historical financial statements do not include any allocation of equifax corporate debt or related interest expense as historically these amounts were not allocated to the operating divisions by equifax we estimate our interest expense would have increased by 84 million in 2001 had equifax allocated interest expense to us on 275 million of debt in the period prior to the distribution this interest amount is based on annual interest at a rate of libor plus 100 basis points which was our cost of borrowing under the revolving credit facility we utilized to fund the payment to equifax 

  

components of income statement 

  

card services generates revenues from charges based on transaction volumes us accounts or cards processed globally and fees for various services and products globally while check services generates revenues from charges based on transaction volumes face value of checks guaranteed and fees for various check services and products revenues depend upon a number of factors such as demand for and price of our services the technological competitiveness of our product line our reputation for providing timely and reliable service competition within our industry and general economic conditions costs of services consist primarily of the costs of transaction processing systems personnel costs to develop and maintain applications operate computer networks and provide customer support losses from check guarantee services interchange processing fees paid to credit card associations and other fees related to merchant processing depreciation and occupancy costs associated with the facilities where these functions are performed and reimbursed outofpocket expenses selling general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries wages and related expenses paid to sales nonrevenue customer support functions and administrative employees and management and prior to the distribution certain allocated equifax corporate costs 

  

as part of our card merchant processing business we contract directly with merchants as well as with merchants’ financial institutions when we have a direct relationship with a merchant revenues collected for our services are based primarily on a discount rate which considers the cost of interchange fees when our relationship is with a merchant’s financial institution we collect the interchange fees in addition to our transaction fees in both instances we are responsible for collecting the interchange fees after settling with the credit card associations interchange fees are recorded as a component of revenues and costs of services 

  

on january 1 2002 we adopted emerging issues task force issue no 0114 “income statement characterization of reimbursements received for ‘outofpocket’ expenses incurred” “eitf 0114” which requires that reimbursements received for outofpocket expenses be classified as revenues historically such reimbursements were netted against costs of services in the consolidated statements of income as a result of this required adoption and certain similar reclassifications actual revenues as previously reported for the year ended december 31 2001 have increased by 848 million for reimbursed outofpocket expenses that include postage delivery telecommunication and other costs these reclassifications have no impact on operating income or net income 

  

also on january 1 2002 we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” “sfas 142” which modifies accounting for business combinations goodwill and identifiable intangible assets as required by this standard the amortization of goodwill ceased on january 1 2002 our operating results for the year ended december 31 2001 include 86 million 73 million aftertax or 010 per diluted share of goodwill amortization expense 

  

gaap and nongaap financial measures 

  

our consolidated financial statements for the years ended december 31 2003 2002 and 2001 have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states or gaap throughout this management’s discussion and analysis we discuss certain financial measures for the year ended december 31 2001 on a gaap and a nongaap basis the 2001 nongaap financial results include adjustments to reflect 1 additional operating and interest expenses estimated by management that would have been incurred in 2001 for the period prior to the distribution had we been operating on a full year standalone basis see further discussion of these estimated additional expenses under the heading “spinoff from equifax in 2001” and 2 the elimination of goodwill amortization expense in 2001 as if sfas 142 had been effective on january 1 2001 management believes that presentation of the 2001 financial results with these adjustments is more meaningful as it allows investors and management to evaluate and compare certegy’s operating results from ongoing operations from period to period in a more consistent manner management uses these nongaap results for 2001 in its management of the business given 1 the results for 2001 would have been different had we been operating on a standalone basis the entire year and thus it is necessary for the additional operating and interest expenses to be included in the results and 2 there is no goodwill amortization expense in our 2003 and 2002 financial results and thus it is more meaningful to exclude this expense in 2001 when comparing financial results with periods subsequent to the adoption of sfas 142 nongaap financial measures however should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with gaap 

  

a reconciliation of the gaap to nongaap financial results for the year ended december 31 2001 is included on page 26 within this management’s discussion and analysis as well as in exhibit 991 to this report 

  

additionally throughout this management’s discussion and analysis we refer to certain financial amounts both on a before and aftertax basis management believes it is helpful to include the aftertax effect of certain financial charges to allow investors and management to evaluate their impact on net income and diluted earnings per share 

  

highlights of the 2003 consolidated financial results 

  

highlights of the 2003 financial results as compared to 2002 including other charges in both years are as follows 

  

   

   

   

   

   

in 2003 we repurchased 26 million shares of our common stock at a cost of 736 million while capital expenditures totaled 440 million 

  

consolidated results of operations 

  

the following table summarizes our consolidated results for the years ended december 31 2003 2002 and 2001 

  

      

consolidated revenues 

  

year 2003 compared with year 2002 

  

consolidated revenues in 2003 of 10 billion increased 75 million or 07 percent over 2002 card services revenues decreased 164 million or 25 percent while check services experienced revenue growth of 239 million or 69 percent 

  

overall our revenue growth was driven by strong growth in our card issuer operations outside of south america and 69 percent growth in our global check business which offset the impact of the loss of a large customer in both our brazilian card issuer business in march 2003 and our merchant processing business in the third quarter of 2002 as well as the purging of merchants in our merchant processing business who no longer met our risk profile criteria in november 2002 the strengthening of certain foreign currencies against the us dollar increased total us dollar revenues by approximately 67 million in 2003 the strengthening exchange rates of the british pound and australian dollar more than offset the more volatile brazilian real 

  

year 2002 compared with year 2001 

  

consolidated revenues in 2002 of 10 billion increased 720 million or 77 percent over 2001 card services revenues grew 292 million or 46 percent while check services experienced revenue growth of 428 million or 141 percent 

  

overall our revenue growth was driven by strong growth in our global card issuer and merchant processing businesses and 141 percent growth in our global check business currency rate changes particularly the weakening of the brazilian real reduced total us dollar revenues by approximately 75 million in 2002 the brazilian real remained volatile throughout the year which more than offset the strengthening exchange rates of the british pound and australian dollar 

  

consolidated operating expenses 

  

year 2003 compared with year 2002 

  

consolidated operating expenses in 2003 of 8611 million increased 50 million or 06 percent over 2002 operating expenses for card services decreased 154 million or 29 percent while check services increased 213 million or 70 percent corporate expenses of 185 million decreased 08 million or 41 percent below 2002 both 2003 and 2002 consolidated operating expenses include 122 million of other charges 

  

costs of services in 2003 of 7328 million increased 10 million or 01 percent over 2002 card services experienced a 213 million or 45 percent decline in costs of services driven by a 296 million decrease in card merchant processing interchange fees costs of services included 1330 million and 1626 million of interchange fees in 2003 and 2002 respectively and a decrease in our south american card issuing costs of services due to the downsizing of our brazilian card operation costs of services in our card issuing businesses in the us the uk and australia increased due to strong volume growth costs of services in check services increased 223 million or 87 percent driven by volume growth in our global core check businesses as well as incremental check cashing costs of services attributable to the continued rollout of services in 2003 

  

selling general and administrative “sga” expenses in 2003 of 1161 million increased 41 million or 37 percent over 2002 card services experienced a 05 million or 10 percent increase in sga costs driven by incremental selling and administrative costs related to the acquisition of netzee on december 31 2002 and higher selling and administrative costs in card issuing primarily in the us and australia which more than offset the decline in brazil’s sga costs attributable to the downsizing of that operation in early 2003 sga costs in check services increased 26 million or 58 percent primarily driven by the growth in new client acquisitions during the year corporate sga expense increased 10 million or 55 percent primarily due to higher employee benefit and insurance costs 

  

during 2003 we recorded other charges of 122 million 77 million aftertax these charges include 96 million of early termination costs associated with a us data processing contract 27 million of charges related to the downsizing of our brazilian card operation and 01 million of market value recoveries on our collateral assignment in life insurance policies net of severance charges 

  

year 2002 compared with year 2001 

  

consolidated operating expenses in 2002 of 8560 million increased 715 million or 91 percent over 2001 operating expenses for card services and check services increased 196 million or 38 percent and 444 million or 170 percent respectively corporate expenses of 193 million increased 75 million over 2001 the 2002 consolidated operating expenses include 122 million of other charges while the 2001 consolidated operating expenses include goodwill amortization expense and no adjustment for estimated additional corporate expenses that we estimate we would have incurred had the spinoff from equifax occurred on january 1 2001 

  

costs of services in 2002 of 7318 million increased 452 million or 66 percent over 2001 on a gaap basis including adjustments for goodwill amortization expense and additional corporate expenses in 2001 costs of services in 2002 increased 514 million or 76 percent over nongaap 2001 approximately 150 million of this increase was attributable to growth in card issuing and merchant volumes and other card services items while 364 million was driven by higher check volumes as well as startup costs related to our check cashing initiatives and other check services items card merchant costs of services included 1626 million and 1461 million of interchange fees in 2002 and 2001 respectively 

  

sga expenses in 2002 of 1120 million increased 140 million or 143 percent over 2001 on a gaap basis including an adjustment for additional corporate expenses in 2001 sga expenses in 2002 increased 131 million or 132 percent over nongaap 2001 this increase is largely attributable to the growth in our international card issuing and north american check businesses as well as incremental costs we incurred as a standalone company after the spinoff 

  

in 2002 we recorded other charges of 122 million 77 million aftertax these charges include an impairment writeoff of 42 million for the remaining intangible asset value assigned to an acquired customer contract in our brazilian card operation due to the loss of the customer a 40 million charge for the settlement of a class action lawsuit net of insurance proceeds and 40 million of severance charges and market value losses on our collateral assignment in life insurance policies

the operating income growth experienced in 2003 was primarily driven by strong revenue growth in card issuing outside of south america the strengthening of certain foreign currencies against the us dollar increased total us dollar operating income by approximately 20 million in 2003 the strengthening exchange rates of the british pound and australian dollar more than offset the more volatile brazilian real 

  

year 2002 compared with year 2001 

  

consolidated operating income in 2002 increased 05 million or 04 percent over 2001 on a gaap basis card services operating income grew 96 million or 80 percent while check services operating income decreased 16 million or 37 percent general corporate expense increased 75 million over 2001 which was the year in which the corporate headquarters office was established after the spinoff from equifax combined operating margins were 151 percent in 2002 and 162 percent in 2001 the 2002 consolidated operating income includes 122 million of other charges while the 2001 consolidated operating income includes 86 million of goodwill amortization expense and no adjustment for estimated additional corporate expenses that we would have incurred had the spinoff from equifax occurred on january 1 2001 

  

consolidated operating income in 2002 decreased 48 million or 30 percent compared to nongaap operating income of 1567 million in 2001 which is adjusted for goodwill amortization expense and additional corporate expenses the operating income decline experienced in 2002 was driven by the 122 million of other charges incurred in 2002 reduced operating income in our south american card operations due to unfavorable currency rates and volatile economic conditions and costs associated with our continued investment in check cashing initiatives currency rate changes particularly the weakening of the brazilian real reduced total us dollar operating income by approximately 09 million in 2002 the brazilian real remained volatile throughout the year which more than offset the strengthening exchange rates of the british pound and australian dollar 

  

consolidated other income net 

  

consolidated other income net which principally consists of interest income and net foreign currency exchange gains totaled 23 million 11 million and 01 million during 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively the increase in 2003 over the respective prior year periods is due primarily to income earned on temporary cash balances primarily outside the us 

  

consolidated interest expense 

  

during september 2003 we issued 200 million of fiveyear senior unsecured notes at 475 percent the proceeds of which were primarily used to repay outstanding indebtedness on our revolving credit facility see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for further information 

  

interest expense in 2003 of 80 million increased 08 million compared to both 2002 and 2001 the growth in interest expense in 2003 compared to 2002 is driven by periodic borrowings on our revolving credit facility and the issuance of our 200 million fiveyear notes in september 2003 the 2001 interest expense includes interest expense on our revolving credit facility from the distribution date of july 7 2001 through the end of the year interest expense for the period prior to the distribution principally consists of interest paid on a line of credit held by our card processing operation in brazil and interest charged by equifax on overnight funds borrowed on our behalf we were not allocated any equifax corporate debt or related interest expense as historically these amounts were not allocated to the operating divisions by equifax we estimate our interest expense would have increased by 84 million in 2001 had equifax allocated interest expense to us on 275 million of debt in the period prior to the distribution this interest amount is based on annual interest at a rate of libor plus 100 basis points which was our cost of borrowing under the revolving credit facility we utilized to fund the payment to equifax considering the additional interest expense that would have been incurred in 2001 had the spinoff from equifax occurred on january 1 2001 overall interest expense in 2002 declined compared to nongaap 2001 due to lower interest rates and lower average debt balances in 2002 

  

  

our outstanding longterm debt at december 31 2003 consists of 1 1994 million of fiveyear notes which is net of unamortized discount 2 224 million of longterm notes payable related to our st petersburg florida synthetic lease resulting from the adoption of certain provisions of fin 46 see notes 2 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements for further information and 3 06 million of capital lease obligations for computer equipment 

  

interest expense is expected to increase in 2004 as a result of our fixed rate 200 million notes and the consolidation of our st petersburg florida synthetic lease required by the adoption of certain provisions of fin 46 

  

effective tax rate 

  

our effective tax rates were 370 percent before the cumulative effect of the accounting change 383 percent and 390 percent in 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively our lower effective rate in 2003 was driven by the implementation of certain international and state tax planning strategies effective tax rate changes from 2001 to 2002 were mainly driven by the elimination of goodwill amortization beginning january 1 2002 as required by sfas 142 we expect our effective tax rate to be 370 percent in 2004 

  

prior to the distribution we were included in the consolidated federal income tax return of equifax federal and certain state tax provisions were settled through the intercompany accounts and equifax made income tax payments on our behalf the provision for income taxes for the period prior to the distribution reflects federal state and foreign taxes calculated using the separate return basis

card services 

  

overview 

  

our card processing business in north america is concentrated in the community bank and credit union market segments we have longterm contractual alliances with two trade associations representing independent community banks and credit unions in the us the independent community bankers of america “the icba” and card services for credit unions “cscu” in december 2003 our contracts with the icba and cscu were extended into 2008 and 2009 respectively also in 2003 we entered into a tenyear agreement with ibm to provide data processing and related services for our us operations which replaced an existing arrangement we had with eds we expect to achieve significant cost savings and future operational flexibility through this new arrangement 

  

card transactions continue to increase as a percentage of total pointofsale payments which fuels continuing demand for cardrelated products we continue to launch new products aimed at serving this demand in recent years we have introduced a variety of storedvalue card types internet banking and electronic bill presentmentpayment products as well as a number of card enhancement and loyaltyreward programs the common theme among these offerings continues to be convenience and security for the consumer coupled with value to the financial institution

year 2003 compared with year 2002 

  

card services revenues of 6445 million in 2003 decreased 164 million or 25 percent below 2002 the loss of our largest customer in our brazilian card operation which deconverted its portfolio at the beginning of march 2003 the loss of a large customer in our merchant processing business which was acquired and moved its account to its new owner’s processor in the third quarter of 2002 and the purging of merchants in our merchant processing business who no longer met our risk profile criteria in november 2002 were the largest drivers behind this decline we experienced strong growth in card issuing revenue outside of south america while card issuing software and support revenue grew 21 million attributable to a large software implementation and consulting project that commenced in late 2002 the strengthening of certain foreign currencies against the us dollar increased our us dollar revenues by approximately 16 million in 2003 the strengthening exchange rates of the british pound and australian dollar more than offset the more volatile brazilian real at december 31 2003 we were processing 464 million cards during 2003 we added approximately 45 million new cards to our global portfolio which was offset by a 47 million card old base reduction for planned deconversions and deletion of inactive cards in our international operations 

  

north american card issuing revenues of 3698 million in 2003 increased 404 million or 123 percent over the prior year this growth is the result of increasing card usage new card issuance and growth in fullservice card loyalty products and other products including enhancement programs and ebanking north american card transactions increased 99 percent over the prior year with debit card transaction growth of 189 percent and credit card transaction growth of 36 percent we added approximately 09 million domestic cards during 2003 increasing our domestic card base to 234 million at december 31 2003

merchant processing revenues of 1703 million in 2003 decreased 326 million or 160 percent below the prior year the loss of a large customer in the third quarter of 2002 and lower debit interchange rates contributed to a reduction in interchange passthrough revenue from 1626 million in 2002 to 1330 million in 2003 a change of 296 million net of interchange passthrough revenues in 2003 were below the prior year by 30 million or 73 percent due primarily to the purging of merchants who no longer met our risk profile criteria in november 2002 

  

card issuing software and support revenue of 116 million increased 21 million over the prior year attributable to a large software implementation and consulting project that commenced in late 2002 card issuing software and support revenue is expected to decline in 2004 as this large project was substantially completed as of december 31 2003

year 2002 compared with year 2001 

  

card services revenues of 6609 million in 2002 increased 292 million or 46 percent over 2001 our revenue growth is attributable to existing and new card growth in both our domestic and international card operations as well as increased revenues in our merchant processing business currency rate changes particularly the weakening of the brazilian real reduced total us dollar revenues by approximately 97 million in 2002 the brazilian real remained volatile throughout the year which more than offset the strengthening exchange rates of the british pound and australian dollar at december 31 2002 we were processing 467 million cards which is an increase of 50 million cards or 119 percent over the prior yearend 

  

north american card issuing revenues of 3294 million in 2002 increased 71 million or 22 percent over the prior year this growth is the result of increased card usage new card growth and increased pricing on certain contracts that was fully in place by the fourth quarter of 2002 north american card transactions increased 85 percent over the prior year with debit card transaction growth of 187 percent and credit card transaction growth of 25 percent we added approximately 10 million domestic cards during 2002 increasing our domestic card base to 225 million at december 31 2002

check services 

  

overview 

  

we believe check writing has begun to decline as a total percentage of pointofsale payments due in part to the growing use of debit and credit cards at the same time however demand for our services is strong due to factors that include increasing sophistication of check fraud and higher concentration of bad checks written at the pointofsale due to a trend of higher credit quality consumers paying more with credit and debit cards and writing fewer checks these factors are contributing to a growing reliance of retailers and other businesses on outside vendors such as us to provide check risk management services additionally in recent years we have introduced several new products for existing and new markets including payroll check cashing and thirdparty check collections 

  

year 2003 compared with year 2002

north american check revenues of 3078 million increased 132 million or 45 percent over 2002 driven by a 44 percent increase in check guarantee volumes largely resulting from the addition of new customers and growth in our check cashing revenues growth in our core business was impacted by weak retail sales throughout the year driven by soft consumer spending the face amount of checks we authorized in the us totaled 318 billion in 2003 as compared to 316 billion in 2002

year 2002 compared to year 2001 

  

general corporate expense of 193 million in 2002 which includes 14 million of other charges increased 74 million over 2001 on a gaap basis which does not include any additional corporate costs that we estimate we would have incurred had we been a standalone company for the entire year general corporate expense increased 42 million or 279 percent compared to nongaap general corporate expense of 151 million in 2001 which is adjusted for 32 million of additional corporate costs that we estimate we would have incurred had we been operating on a standalone company basis for the entire year driven by the 14 million of other charges incremental costs for the conversion of administrative functions which were previously outsourced to a thirdparty and recruiting and relocation expenses for new hires in 2002 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

we have historically generated and continue to generate strong cash flows from our operating activities that we use to further invest in our business through expenditures for capital and strategic acquisitions additionally since our spinoff from equifax in 2001 we have engaged in periodic repurchases of our common shares when it has been deemed appropriate and began to pay cash dividends to our shareholders in 2003 proceeds from stock option exercises have varied each year primarily driven by changes in our stock price 

  

in conjunction with the spinoff from equifax we made a cash payment to equifax in the amount of 275 million in july 2001 to reflect certegy’s share of equifax’s predistribution debt used to establish our initial capitalization this payment was funded through a 400 million unsecured revolving credit facilities we obtained since that time we have used available cash flow to reduce our outstanding balance on these facilities and on september 10 2003 we used the proceeds from our offering of 475 percent fixed rate fiveyear notes with a face value of 200 million to pay down the remaining revolver balance 

  

cash flow from operations is expected to be strong in 2004 our cash needs for 2004 will be primarily related to capital expenditures and payment of dividends we expect our capital expenditures for 2004 to be approximately 45 million we plan to use a significant portion of our remaining available cash flow to repurchase our common shares however the extent of share repurchases could change based upon acquisition opportunities 

  

we regularly evaluate cash requirements for current operations development activities and acquisitions we may elect to raise additional funds for these purposes either through further bank financing or the public capital markets as appropriate based on our recent financial results and current financial position we believe that additional funding will be available if required to meet our capital requirements

revolving credit facility in september 2003 we cancelled our 300 million revolving credit facility and replaced it with a new 200 million revolving credit facility which expires in september 2006 the new facility has substantially the same terms as the former facility except there are no subsidiary guarantees the new facility bears interest at an annual rate of libor plus 100 basis points and contains certain financial covenants related to interest coverage and funded debt to cash flow borrowings on the new facility are available to meet working capital needs and to fund strategic acquisitions and the periodic repurchase of shares when deemed appropriate there was no outstanding balance under this facility at december 31 2003 the amount outstanding under the 300 million facility at december 31 2002 was 2142 million 

  

we also have an unsecured revolving credit facility that provides advances to finance our customers’ shortfalls in the daily funding requirements associated with our credit and debit card settlement operations upon renewal of this facility in june 2003 we lowered the total available borrowing amount from 130 million to 100 million outstanding borrowings on this credit facility are classified as part of the company’s settlement payables in the consolidated balance sheets there were no amounts outstanding under this facility at december 31 2003 or december 31 2002 

  

contractual obligations in 2003 we entered into a tenyear agreement with ibm which replaced our existing agreement with eds for us data processing services the transition from eds to ibm was completed in the third quarter of 2003 

  

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commitments as of december 31 2003 

  

 note this table excludes other obligations that we may have such as employee benefit obligations discussed in note 9 to the consolidated financial statements residual value guarantees under our synthetic leases see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements and other current and longterm liabilities reflected in our consolidated balance sheets 

  

offbalance sheet arrangements note 10 to the consolidated financial statements also describes certain offbalance sheet arrangements in the form of synthetic leases and the change in accounting for one of the leases that was adopted on december 31 2003 in accordance with certain provisions of fin 46 

  

other than facility leasing arrangements we do not engage in offbalance sheet financing activities we entered into synthetic operating leases in order to provide us with favorable financing arrangements with regard to the facilities subject to the leases the first synthetic lease on our madison wisconsin facility of 104 million was entered into in 1997 and the second synthetic lease on our st petersburg florida facility of 232 million was entered into in 1999 both of which expire in 2009 under these synthetic lease arrangements we have guaranteed the residual value of the leased properties to the lessors in the event the properties are sold by the lessors at the end of the lease terms we would be responsible for any shortfall of the sales proceeds under 264 million which approximates 79 percent of the value of the properties at the beginning of the lease terms we believe the fair market values of these properties exceed the amount of the guarantees on december 31 2003 we adopted certain provisions of fin 46 which required us to consolidate our st petersburg florida facility in our consolidated financial statements 

  

as described in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements we have an interest rate swap arrangement in effect that fixes the interest rate for one of our variable rate synthetic lease obligations this derivative has been designated as a cash flow hedge was documented as fully effective and at december 31 2003 was valued as a liability totaling 15 million 

  

related parties other than our transactions with equifax which are described in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements we do not have any material related party transactions 

  

critical accounting policies 

  

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if 

  

   

   

our significant accounting policies are described in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements we believe that the following accounting policies involve a higher degree of complexity and warrant specific description 

  

reserve for card merchant processing and check guarantee losses in our direct card merchant processing business if due to insolvency or bankruptcy of the merchant or for another reason we are not able to collect amounts from our merchant customers that have been properly “charged back” by the cardholders we must bear the credit risk for the full amount of the cardholder transaction we require cash deposits and other types of collateral from certain merchants to minimize any such risk in addition we utilize a number of systems and procedures to manage merchant risk and believe that the diversification of our merchant portfolio among industries and geographic regions minimizes our risk of loss card merchant processing loss reserves are primarily determined by performing a historical analysis of our chargeback loss experience and considering other factors that could affect that experience in the future such items include the general economy and the credit quality of our merchant customers once these factors are considered we assess the reserve adequacy by comparing the recorded reserve to the estimated amount based on an analysis of the current trend changes or specific anticipated future events any adjustments are charged to costs of services this reserve amount is subject to risk that actual losses may be greater than our estimates at december 31 2003 and 2002 we had aggregate card merchant processing loss reserves of 11 million and 10 million respectively which are included in other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets 

  

in our check guarantee business if a guaranteed check presented to a merchant customer is dishonored by the check writer’s bank we reimburse our merchant customer for the check’s face value and pursue collection of the amount from the delinquent check writer loss reserves and anticipated recoveries are primarily determined by performing a historical analysis of our check loss and recovery experience and considering other factors that could affect that experience in the future such items include the general economy the overall industry mix of our customer volumes statistical analysis of check fraud trends within our customer volumes and the quality of returned checks once these factors are considered we establish a rate for check losses that is calculated by dividing the expected check losses by dollar volume processed and a rate for anticipated recoveries that is calculated by dividing the anticipated recoveries by the total amount of related check losses these rates are then applied against the dollar volume processed and check losses respectively each month and charged to costs of services the estimated check returns and recovery amounts are subject to risk that actual amounts returned and recovered may be different than our estimates at december 31 2003 and 2002 we had accrued claims payable and accrued claims recoverable balances of 383 million and 465 million and 483 million and 503 million respectively 

  

historically such estimation processes have proven to be materially accurate however our projections of probable card merchant processing losses check guarantee losses and anticipated recoveries are inherently uncertain and as a result we cannot predict with certainty the amount of such items changes in economic conditions the risk characteristics and composition of our customers and other factors could impact our actual and projected amounts expenses of 1529 million 1461 million and 1287 million respectively were recorded in costs of services for the years ended december 31 2003 2002 and 2001 for card merchant processing losses and check guarantee losses net of anticipated recoveries a one percent increase in our card merchant processing and check guarantee losses net of anticipated recoveries in 2003 would have reduced 2003 net income by approximately 10 million aftertax 

  

valuation of goodwill and other longlived assets goodwill and certain other intangible assets are tested for impairment in accordance with sfas 142 and all other longlived assets are tested in accordance with sfas no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” we regularly evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred which indicate that the carrying amounts of goodwill and other longlived assets primarily property and equipment other intangible assets and systems development and other deferred costs may be impaired or not recoverable the significant factors that are considered that could trigger an impairment review include changes in business strategy market conditions or the manner of use of an asset underperformance relative to historical or expected future operating results and negative industry or economic trends in evaluating an asset for possible impairment management estimates that asset’s future undiscounted cash flows to measure whether the asset is recoverable if it is determined that the asset is not recoverable we measure the impairment based on the projected discounted cash flows of the asset over its remaining life 

  

we make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the determination of the expected future cash flows of assets these estimates and assumptions include revenue and operating income growth assetrelated expenditures and other factors while we believe that our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable different assumptions regarding such cash flows could materially affect these evaluations and could result in an impairment in the opinion of management goodwill and other longlived assets are appropriately valued at december 31 2003 and 2002 

  

income taxes we record income taxes in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 109 “accounting for income taxes” using the asset and liability method the asset and liability method requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for expected future tax consequences of temporary differences that exist between the tax bases and financial reporting bases of our assets and liabilities based on enacted tax rates expected to apply in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled a valuation allowance is provided against deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized no provision is made for us income taxes on undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries because those earnings are considered permanently reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries 

  

in addition to estimating the future tax rates applicable to the reversal of tax differences management must also make certain assumptions regarding whether tax differences are permanent or temporary if the differences are temporary management must estimate the timing of their reversal and whether taxable operating income in future periods will be sufficient to fully recognize any gross deferred tax assets 

  

for the years ended december 31 2003 2002 and 2001 management made no material changes in its assumptions regarding the determination of the provision for income taxes except that during 2002 we determined that our investments in certain foreign subsidiaries are permanently invested and will not be repatriated to the us in the foreseeable future future us tax consequences on the undistributed earnings of these subsidiaries are no longer considered in the tax provision calculation in accordance with apb opinion no 23 at december 31 2003 there are approximately 241 million of undistributed net earnings for which no additional us tax is provided certain events could occur that would materially affect our estimates and assumptions regarding deferred taxes changes in current tax laws and applicable enacted tax rates could affect the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities thereby impacting our income tax provision additionally significant declines in taxable operating income could materially impact the realizable value of deferred tax assets 

  

for the year ended december 31 2003 our provision for income taxes was 551 million consisting of 400 million for current tax expense and 151 million for deferred tax expense changes in management’s estimates and assumptions regarding the enacted tax rate applied to deferred tax assets and liabilities the ability to realize the value of deferred tax assets or the timing of the reversal of tax basis differences could potentially impact the provision for income taxes a one percent change in the effective tax rate from 370 percent in 2003 to 380 percent would have increased the 2003 income tax provision by 15 million 

  

employee benefit obligations the plan obligations and related assets of our defined benefit retirement and postretirement plans are presented in note 9 to the consolidated financial statements plan assets which consist primarily of marketable equity and debt instruments are valued using market quotations plan obligations and the annual net periodic benefit cost are determined by independent actuaries and through the use of a number of assumptions key assumptions in measuring the plan obligations include the discount rate the rate of salary increases and the estimated future return on plan assets in determining the discount rate we utilize the yield on highquality 

  

fixedincome investments currently available with maturities corresponding to the anticipated timing of benefit payments salary increase assumptions are based upon historical experience and anticipated future management actions asset returns are based upon the anticipated average rate of earnings expected on the invested funds of the plans 

  

we have made certain other estimates that while not involving the same degree of judgment are important to understanding our financial statements on an ongoing basis management evaluates its estimates and judgments in these areas based on its historical experience and other relevant factors management’s estimates as of the date of the financial statements reflect its best judgment giving consideration to all currently available facts and circumstances as such these estimates may require adjustment in the future as additional facts become known or as circumstances change 

  

seasonality inflation and economic downturns 

  

we are subject to certain seasonal fluctuations such as peak activity during the holiday buying season we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our operating results however inflation could adversely affect our financial results were it to result in a substantial weakening in economic conditions that adversely affects the level of consumer spending our check revenue growth has continued to be impacted by weak retail sales driven in part by soft consumer spending 

  

the brazilian market is characterized by political and economic uncertainty that causes volatility in currency values and historically has resulted in severe inflationary pressures notwithstanding this uncertainty we believe that the longterm prospects offered by the brazilian market are attractive and our continued focus on growing our brazilian business and attaining cost efficiencies should provide us with a cost structure that can withstand shortterm declines in business driven by the uncertain market and the loss of our largest customer in march 2003 

  

our brazilian operations had net assets of approximately 1022 million at december 31 2003 which includes a net equity reduction of 967 million as a result of cumulative foreign currency translation pursuant to sfas 142 and sfas 144 these assets are subject to regular evaluations to assess their recoverability in the opinion of management these assets are appropriately valued at december 31 2003 and 2002 however if we are unable to improve profitability in our brazilian operations by growing revenue or achieving the necessary cost efficient structure in the future this could have an impact on our opinion regarding the valuation of these assets which could lead to an impairment charge against net income 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

based on analysis completed and described below we do not believe that we are exposed to material market risk from changes in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates 

  

interest rates we have an unsecured revolving credit facility and a synthetic lease obligation that have variable interest rates therefore we are exposed to the impact of interest rate fluctuations this risk is somewhat mitigated by our ability to fix the base libor rate for periods of up to six months on our revolving credit facility and by using interest rate swap arrangements there were no amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility at december 31 2003 while the balance on our synthetic lease obligation at december 31 2003 was 224 million we have performed an interest rate sensitivity analysis assuming a 100 basis point increase in libor for the period subsequent to december 31 2003 for our synthetic lease obligation and the increase in interest expense would not be material 

  

foreign currency exchange rates approximately 155 percent of our consolidated revenues for the year ended december 31 2003 and 359 percent of our consolidated assets at december 31 2003 are associated with operations outside of the us the us dollar balance sheets and statements of income for these businesses are subject to currency fluctuations we are most vulnerable to fluctuations in the brazilian real and the british pound against the us dollar historically we have not entered into derivative financial instruments to mitigate this risk as it has not been costeffective the impact of currency fluctuations on profitability has not been significant since both revenues and operating costs of these businesses are denominated in local currency if the us dollar had a 10 percent higher appreciation against our nonus dollar denominated businesses in 2003 consolidated revenues and operating income would have been reduced by 156 million and 06 million respectively we may use derivative financial instruments in the future if we deem it useful in mitigating an exposure to foreign currency exchange rates the cumulative translation adjustment largely related to our investment in our brazilian card processing operation was a 751 million and 1134 million reduction of shareholders’ equity at december 31 2003 and 2002 respectively
