although our portfolio of patents is growing the patents that have been issued to us could be determined to be invalid and may not be enforceable against competitive products in every jurisdiction in addition third parties have asserted and may in the future assert infringement claims against us and our customers these claims and any litigation may result in invalidation of our proprietary rights or a finding of infringement along with an assessment of damages litigation even if without merit could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention in addition thirdparty licenses may not continue to be available to us on commercially acceptable terms or at all

 item 1a  risk factors tableend

our businesses routinely encounter and address risks many of which could cause our future results to be materially different than we presently anticipate below we describe significant factors events and uncertainties that make an investment in our securities risky categorized solely for ease of reference as strategic operational legal and compliance and financial risks the following events and consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business growth prospects financial condition results of operations cash flows liquidity reputation and credit rating and the trading price of our common stock could decline these risks are not the only ones we face we could also be affected by other events factors or uncertainties that are presently unknown to us or that we do not currently consider to present significant risks to our business these risks may be amplified by the effects of global developments conditions or events like inflationary pressures the russiaukraine war and the covid19 pandemic which have caused significant global economic instability and uncertainty 

the covid19 pandemic has caused significant economic instability and uncertainty and the extent to which it will impact our business results of operations and financial condition is uncertain and difficult to predict 

the covid19 pandemic has caused economic instability and uncertainty globally and in fiscal 2020 had a temporary negative impact on our business the severity and duration of the pandemic’s impact on our business and financial performance will depend on many factors beyond our control including the emergence and virulence of new variants of the covid19 virus the related responses of governments and businesses and the availability effectiveness and adoption of vaccines and treatments potential and current negative impacts of the pandemic include but are not limited to the following 

• there are new and more frequent attempts by malicious third parties seeking to take advantage of our employees while working remotely to fraudulently gain access to our systems which could cause us to expend significant resources to remediate and could damage our reputation 

• the complexity of resuming operations in our offices under a hybrid workplace model may adversely impact the productivity health and wellbeing of our workforce and exacerbate security and execution risks that could cause us to lose the confidence of our customers and government agencies and harm our revenues and earnings 

• potential disruption of services on which we rely to deliver our services to our customers such as our thirdparty customer success partners and financial institutions could prevent us or our service providers from delivering critical services to our customers or accepting and fulfilling customer orders any of which could materially and adversely affect our business or reputation 

• failure to realize some or all of the anticipated benefits of our mergers and acquisitions activities for reasons related to the pandemic may cause us to experience losses that result in significant harm to our operating results or financial condition 

• there could be increased volatility in our stock price related to the pandemic which could result in the loss of some or all of the value of an investment in intuit 

these and other potential negative impacts relating to the covid19 pandemic are described further in the risk factors that follow 

strategic risks 

we face intense competitive pressures that may harm our operating results 

we face intense competition in all of our businesses and we expect competition to remain intense in the future our competitors and potential competitors range from large and established entities to emerging startups our competitors may introduce superior products and services reduce prices have greater technical marketing and other resources have greater name recognition have larger installed bases of customers have wellestablished relationships with our current and potential customers advertise aggressively or beat us to market with new products and services in addition we face competition from existing companies with large established consumer userbases and broadbased platforms who may change or expand the focus of their business strategies and marketing to target our customers including small businesses tax and personal financial management customers 

we also face competition from companies with a variety of business models including increased competition from providers of free offerings particularly in our tax accounting payments and personal finance platform businesses in order to compete we have also introduced free offerings in several categories but we may not be able to attract customers as effectively as competitors with different business models in addition other providers of free offerings may provide features that we do not offer and customers who have formerly paid for our products and services may elect to use our competitors’ free offerings instead these competitive factors may diminish our revenue and profitability and harm our ability to acquire and retain customers 

our consumer tax business also faces significant potential competition from the public sector where we face the risk of federal and state taxing authorities proposing revenue raising strategies that involve developing and providing government tax 



tables of contents 

software or other government return preparation systems at public expense these or similar programs may be introduced or expanded in the future which may change the voluntary compliance tax system in ways that could cause us to lose customers and revenue the irs free file program is currently the sole means by which the irs offers tax software directly to taxpayers and its continuation depends on a number of factors including continued broad public awareness of and access to the free program and continued private industry donations as well as continued government support the free file program operates under an agreement that is scheduled to expire in october 2023 if the free file program were to be terminated or the irs were to enter the software development and return preparation space the federal government could become a publicly funded direct competitor of the us tax services industry and of intuit government funded services that curtail or eliminate the role of taxpayers in preparing their own taxes could potentially have material and adverse revenue implications on us 

future revenue growth depends upon our ability to adapt to technological change as well as global trends in the way customers access software offerings and successfully introduce new and enhanced products services and business models 

we operate in industries that are characterized by rapidly changing technology evolving industry standards and frequent new product introductions to meet the changing needs of our customers and partners and attract and retain top technical talent we must continue to innovate develop new products and features and enhance our ability to solve customer problems with emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and blockchain we have and will continue to devote significant resources to continue to develop our skills tools and capabilities to capitalize on existing and emerging technologies 

our consumer and professional tax businesses depend significantly on revenue from customers who return each year to use our updated tax preparation and filing software and services as our existing products mature encouraging customers to purchase product upgrades becomes more challenging unless new product releases provide features and functionality that have meaningful incremental value as we continue to introduce and expand our new business models including offerings that are free to end users our customers may not perceive value in the additional benefits and services we offer beyond our free offering and may choose not to pay for those additional benefits or we may be unsuccessful in increasing customer adoption of these offerings or our risk profile may change resulting in loss of revenue 

we also provide additional customer benefits by utilizing customer data available to us through our existing offerings and the growth of our business depends in part on our existing customers expanding their use of our products and services if we are not able to effectively utilize our customers’ data to provide them with value or develop and clearly demonstrate the value of new or upgraded products or services to our customers our revenues may be harmed 

while we offer our products on a variety of hardware platforms if we cannot continue adapting our products to tablet and mobile devices or if our competitors can adapt their products more quickly than us our business could be harmed as new devices and new platforms are continually being released it is difficult to predict the problems we may encounter in developing versions of our products and services for use on mobile devices and we may need to devote significant resources to the creation support and maintenance of such offerings further legislation or regulatory changes may mandate changes in our products that make them less attractive to users 

in some cases we may expend a significant amount of resources and management attention on offerings that do not ultimately succeed in their markets we have encountered difficulty in launching new products and services in the past if we misjudge customer needs in the future our new products and services may not succeed and our revenues and earnings may be harmed we have also invested and in the future expect to invest in new business models geographies strategies and initiatives such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties including distraction of management from current operations expenses associated with the initiatives and inadequate return on investments because these new initiatives are inherently risky they may not be successful and may harm our financial condition and operating results 

we rely on thirdparty intellectual property in our products and services 

many of our products and services include intellectual property of third parties which we license under agreements that may need to be renewed or renegotiated from time to time we may not be able to obtain licenses to these thirdparty technologies or content on reasonable terms or at all if we are unable to obtain the rights necessary to use this intellectual property in our products and services we may not be able to provide the affected offerings and customers who are currently using the affected product may be disrupted which may in turn harm our future financial results damage our brand and result in customer loss also we and our customers have been and may continue to be subject to infringement claims as a result of the thirdparty intellectual property incorporated in our offerings although we try to mitigate this risk and we may not be ultimately liable for any potential infringement pending claims require us to use significant resources require management attention and could result in loss of customers 

some of our offerings include thirdparty software that is licensed under socalled “open source” licenses some of which may include a requirement that under certain circumstances we make available or grant licenses to any modifications or derivative works we create based upon the open source software although we have established internal review and approval processes to mitigate these risks we cannot be sure that all open source software is submitted for approval prior to use in our products many of the risks associated with usage of open source may not be eliminated and if not properly addressed may harm our business 



tables of contents 

our intellectual property rights are valuable and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products services and brand 

our patents trademarks trade secrets copyrights domain names and other intellectual property rights are important assets for us we aggressively protect our intellectual property rights by relying on federal state and common law rights in the us and internationally as well as a variety of administrative procedures we also rely on contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary rights in products and services the efforts that we take to protect our proprietary rights may not always be sufficient or effective protecting our intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming and may not be successful in every location any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business our brand and our ability to compete 

policing unauthorized use and copying of our products is difficult expensive and time consuming current us laws that prohibit copying give us only limited practical protection from software piracy and the laws of many other countries provide very little protection we frequently encounter unauthorized copies of our software being sold through online marketplaces although we continue to evaluate and put in place technology solutions to attempt to lessen the impact of piracy and engage in efforts to educate consumers and public policy leaders on these issues and cooperate with industry groups in their efforts to combat piracy we expect piracy to be a persistent problem that results in lost revenues and increased expenses 

our business depends on our strong reputation and the value of our brands 

developing and maintaining awareness of our brands is critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our existing and future products and services and is an important element in attracting new customers adverse publicity whether or not justified relating to events or activities attributed to us members of our workforce agents third parties we rely on or our users may tarnish our reputation and reduce the value of our brands our brand value also depends on our ability to provide secure and trustworthy products and services as well as our ability to protect and use our customers’ data in a manner that meets their expectations in addition a security incident that results in unauthorized disclosure of our customers’ sensitive data could cause material reputational harm 

we have public environmental social and governance esg commitments including our goals to increase the diversity of our workforce create and prepare individuals for jobs and have a positive impact on the climate our ability to achieve these goals is subject to numerous risks that may be outside of our control our failure or perceived failure to achieve our esg goals or maintain esg practices that meet evolving stakeholder expectations could harm our reputation adversely impact our ability to attract and retain employees or customers and expose us to increased scrutiny from the investment community and enforcement authorities our reputation also may be harmed by the perceptions that our customers employees and other stakeholders have about our action or inaction on social ethical or political issues damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity may reduce demand for our products and services and thus have an adverse effect on our future financial results as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of the brands and could also reduce our stock price 

our acquisition and divestiture activities may disrupt our ongoing business may involve increased expenses and may present risks not contemplated at the time of the transactions 

we have acquired and may continue to acquire companies products technologies and talent that complement our strategic direction both in and outside the united states acquisitions such as our acquisition of mailchimp involve significant risks and uncertainties including 

• inability to successfully integrate the acquired technology data assets and operations into our business and maintain uniform standards controls policies and procedures 

• inability to realize synergies or anticipated benefits expected to result from an acquisition within the expected time fame or at all 

• disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management 

• challenges retaining the key employees customers resellers and other business partners of the acquired operation 

• the internal control environment of an acquired entity may not be consistent with our standards or with regulatory requirements and may require significant time and resources to align or rectify 

• unidentified issues not discovered in our due diligence process including product or service quality issues intellectual property issues and legal contingencies 

• failure to successfully further develop an acquired business or technology and any resulting impairment of amounts currently capitalized as intangible assets 

• risks associated with businesses we acquire or invest in which may differ from or be more significant than the risks our other businesses face 

• in the case of foreign acquisitions and investments the impact of particular economic tax currency political legal and regulatory risks associated with specific countries and 



tables of contents 

• to the extent we use debt to fund acquisitions or for other purposes our interest expense and leverage will increase significantly and to the extent we issue equity securities as consideration in an acquisition current shareholders’ percentage ownership and earnings per share will be diluted 

we have divested and may in the future divest certain assets or businesses that no longer fit with our strategic direction or growth targets divestitures involve significant risks and uncertainties including 

• inability to find potential buyers on favorable terms 

• failure to effectively transfer liabilities contracts facilities and employees to buyers 

• requirements that we retain or indemnify buyers against certain liabilities and obligations 

• the possibility that we will become subject to thirdparty claims arising out of such divestiture 

• challenges in identifying and separating the intellectual property systems and data to be divested from the intellectual property systems and data that we wish to retain 

• inability to reduce fixed costs previously associated with the divested assets or business 

• challenges in collecting the proceeds from any divestiture 

• disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management 

• loss of key employees who leave us as a result of a divestiture and 

• if customers or partners of the divested business do not receive the same level of service from the new owners our other businesses may be adversely affected to the extent that these customers or partners also purchase other products offered by us or otherwise conduct business with our retained business 

in addition any acquisition or divestiture that we announce may not be completed if closing conditions are not satisfied because acquisitions and divestitures are inherently risky our transactions may not be successful and may in some cases harm our operating results or financial condition in particular if we are unable to successfully operate together with credit karma mailchimp or any other company that we acquire to achieve shared growth opportunities or combine reporting or other processes within the expected time frame or at all there may be a material and adverse effect on the benefits that we expect to achieve as a result of the acquisition and we could experience additional costs or loss of revenue moreover adverse changes in market conditions and other factorsincluding those listed above may cause an acquisition to be dilutive to intuit’s operating earnings per share for a period of time any dilution of our nongaap diluted earnings per share could cause the price of shares of intuit common stock to decline or grow at a reduced rate 

operational risks 

security incidents improper access to or disclosure of our data or customers’ data or other cyberattacks on our systems could harm our reputation and adversely affect our business 

we host collect use and retain large amounts of sensitive and personal customer and workforce data including credit card information tax return information bank account numbers credit report information login credentials and passwords personal and business financial data and transactions data social security numbers and payroll information as well as our confidential nonpublic business information we use commercially available security technologies and security and business controls to limit access to and use of such sensitive data although we expend significant resources to create security protections designed to shield this data against potential theft and security breaches such measures cannot provide absolute security 

our technologies systems and networks have been subject to and are increasingly likely to continue to be the target of cyberattacks computer viruses ransomware or other malware worms social engineering malicious software programs insider threats and other cybersecurity incidents that could result in the unauthorized release gathering monitoring use loss or destruction of sensitive and personal data of our customers and our workforce or intuits sensitive business data or cause temporary or sustained unavailability of our software and systems while we maintain cybersecurity insurance our insurance may not be sufficient to cover all liabilities described herein these types of incidents can be caused by malicious third parties acting alone or in groups or more sophisticated organizations including nationstates or statesponsored organizations and the risks could be elevated in connection with the russiaukraine war customers who fail to update their systems continue to run software that we no longer support fail to install security patches on a timely basis or inadequately use security controls create vulnerabilities and make it more difficult for us to detect and prevent these kinds of attacks we are increasingly incorporating open source software into our products and there may be vulnerabilities in open source software that make it susceptible to cyberattacks in addition because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to sensitive information change frequently and are becoming more sophisticated and are often not able to be detected until after a successful attack we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventive measures although this is an industrywide problem that affects software and hardware across platforms it may increasingly affect our offerings because cybercriminals tend to focus their efforts on wellknown offerings that are popular among customers and hold sensitive personal or financial information like our digital money offerings and we expect them to continue to do so

further the security measures that we implement may not be able to prevent unauthorized access to our products and our customers’ account data while we require annual security training for our workforce malicious third parties have in the past may in the future be able to fraudulently induce members of our workforce customers or users by social engineering means such as email phishing to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our systems it is also possible that unauthorized access to or disclosure of customer data may occur due to inadequate use of security controls by our customers or our workforce accounts created with weak or recycled passwords could allow cyberattackers to gain access to customer data unauthorized persons could gain access to customer accounts if customers do not maintain effective access controls of their systems and software in addition we have and will continue to experience new and more frequent attempts by malicious third parties to fraudulently gain access to our systems such as through increased email phishing of our workforce 

criminals may also use stolen identity information obtained outside of our systems to gain unauthorized access to our customers’ data we have experienced such instances in the past and as the accessibility of stolen identity information increases generally we may experience further instances of unauthorized access to our systems through the use of stolen identity information of our customers or our workforce in the future further our customers may choose to use the same login credentials across multiple products and services unrelated to our products such customers’ login credentials may be stolen from products offered by thirdparty service providers unrelated to us and the stolen identity information may be used by a malicious third party to access our products which could result in disclosure of confidential information in addition our shift to a hybrid workplace model where our workforce will spend a portion of their time working in our offices and a portion of their time working from home introduces operational complexity that exacerbates our securityrelated risks 

our efforts to protect data may also be unsuccessful due to software bugs whether open source or proprietary code breakins workforce error or other threats that evolve 

further because we have created an ecosystem where customers can have one identity across multiple intuit products a security incident may give access to increased amounts of customer data this may result in disclosure of confidential information loss of customer confidence in our products possible litigation material harm to our reputation and financial condition disruption of our or our customers’ business operations and a decline in our stock price from time to time we detect or receive notices from customers or public or private agencies that they have detected actual or perceived vulnerabilities in our infrastructure our software or thirdparty software components that are distributed with our products or fraudulent activity by unauthorized persons utilizing our products with stolen customer identity information the existence of such vulnerabilities or fraudulent activity even if they do not result in a security breach may undermine customer confidence as well as the confidence of government agencies that regulate our offerings such perceived vulnerabilities could also seriously harm our business by tarnishing our reputation and brand and limiting the adoption of our products and services and could cause our stock price to decline 

additionally credit karma is subject to an order issued in 2014 by the federal trade commission ftc that among other things requires maintenance of a comprehensive security program relating to the development and management of new and existing products and services and biannual independent security assessments for 20 years from the date of the order to the extent credit karma shares data covered by the order with intuit the order may apply to intuit with respect to such data credit karma’s failure to fulfill the requirements of the ftc’s order could result in fines penalties regulatory inquiries investigations and claims and negatively impact our business and reputation 

a cybersecurity incident affecting the third parties we rely on could expose us or our customers to a risk of loss or misuse of confidential information and significantly damage our reputation 

we depend on a number of third parties including vendors developers and partners who are critical to our business we or our customers may grant access to customer data to these third parties to help deliver customer benefits or to host certain of our and our customers sensitive and personal data in addition we share sensitive nonpublic business information including for example materials relating to financial business and legal strategies with other vendors in the ordinary course of business 

while we conduct background checks of our workforce conduct reviews of partners developers and vendors and use commercially available technologies to limit access to systems and data it is possible that malicious third parties may misrepresent their intended use of data or may circumvent our controls resulting in accidental or intentional disclosure or misuse of our customer or workforce data further while we conduct due diligence on the security and business controls of our thirdparty partners we may not have the ability to effectively monitor or oversee the implementation of these control measures malicious third parties may be able to circumvent these security and business controls or exploit vulnerabilities that may exist in these controls resulting in the disclosure or misuse of sensitive business and personal customer or workforce information and data in addition malicious actors may attempt to use the information technology supply chain to compromise our systems by for example introducing malware through software updates 

a security incident involving third parties we rely on may have serious negative consequences for our businesses including disclosure of sensitive customer or workforce data or confidential or competitively sensitive information regarding our business including intellectual property and other proprietary data make our products more vulnerable to fraudulent activity cause temporary or sustained unavailability of our software and systems result in possible litigation fines penalties and damages result in loss of customer confidence cause material harm to our reputation and brands lead to further regulation and oversight by federal or state agencies cause adverse financial condition and result in a reduced stock price

concerns about the current privacy and cybersecurity environment generally could deter current and potential customers from adopting our products and services and damage our reputation 

the continued occurrence of cyberattacks and data breaches on governments businesses and consumers in general indicates that we operate in an external environment where cyberattacks and data breaches are becoming increasingly common if the global cybersecurity environment worsens and there are increased instances of security breaches of thirdparty offerings where consumers’ data and sensitive information is compromised consumers may be less willing to use online offerings particularly offerings like ours in which customers often share sensitive financial data in addition the increased availability of data obtained as a result of breaches of thirdparty offerings could make our own products more vulnerable to fraudulent activity even if our products are not affected directly by such incidents any such incident could damage our reputation and deter current and potential customers from adopting our products and services or lead customers to cease using online and connected software products to transact financial business altogether 

if we are unable to effectively combat the increasing amount and sophistication of fraudulent activities by malicious third parties we may suffer losses which may be substantial and lose the confidence of our customers and government agencies and our revenues and earnings may be harmed 

the online tax preparation payroll payments lending and personal financial management industries have been experiencing an increasing amount of fraudulent activities by malicious third parties and those fraudulent activities are becoming increasingly sophisticated although we do not believe that any of this activity is uniquely targeted at our products or businesses this type of fraudulent activity may adversely impact our tax payroll payments lending and personal financial management businesses and the risk is heightened when our workforce is working from home in addition to any losses that may result from such fraud which may be substantial a loss of confidence by our customers or by governmental agencies in our ability to prevent fraudulent activity may seriously harm our business and damage our brand if we cannot adequately combat such fraudulent activity governmental authorities may refuse to allow us to continue to offer the affected services or these services may otherwise be adversely impacted which could include federal or state tax authorities refusing to allow us to process our customers’ tax returns electronically resulting in a significant adverse impact on our earnings and revenue as fraudulent activities become more pervasive and increasingly sophisticated and fraud detection and prevention measures must become correspondingly more complex to combat them across the various industries in which we operate we may implement risk control mechanisms that could make it more difficult for legitimate customers to obtain and use our products which could result in lost revenue and negatively impact our earnings 

if we fail to process transactions effectively or fail to adequately protect against disputed or potential fraudulent activities our business may be harmed 

our operations process a significant volume and dollar value of transactions on a daily basis especially in our payroll payments and personal financial management businesses despite our efforts to ensure that effective processing systems and controls are in place to handle transactions appropriately it is possible that we may make errors or that funds may be misappropriated due to fraud the likelihood of any such error or misappropriation is magnified as we increase the volume and speed of the transactions we process if we are unable to effectively manage our systems and processes or if there is an error in our products we may be unable to process customer data in an accurate reliable and timely manner which may harm our reputation the willingness of customers to use our products and our financial results in our payments processing service business if a disputed transaction between a merchant and its customer is not resolved in favor of the merchant we may be required to pay those amounts to the payment or credit card network and these payments may exceed the amount of the customer reserves established to make such payments 

business interruption or failure of our information technology and communication systems may impair the availability of our products and services which may damage our reputation and harm our future financial results 

our reputation and ability to attract retain and serve our customers is dependent upon the reliable performance of our products and our underlying technical infrastructure as we continue to grow our online services we become more dependent on the continuing operation and availability of our information technology and communications systems and those of our external service providers including for example thirdparty internetbased or cloud computing services we do not have redundancy for all of our systems and our disaster recovery planning may not account for all eventualities we have designed a significant portion of our software and computer systems to utilize data processing and storage capabilities provided by public cloud providers such as amazon web services if any public cloud service that we use is unavailable to us for any reason our customers may not be able to access certain of our cloud products or features which could significantly impact our operations business and financial results 

failure of our systems or those of our thirdparty service providers may result in interruptions in our service and loss of data or processing capabilities all of which may cause a loss in customers refunds of product fees material harm to our reputation and operating results 

our tax businesses must effectively handle extremely heavy customer demand during critical peak periods which typically occur from january until april of each year we face significant risks in maintaining adequate service levels during these peak

periods when we have historically derived a substantial portion of our overall revenue from the tax businesses any interruptions in our online tax preparation or electronic filing service at any time during the tax season particularly during a peak period could result in significantly decreased revenue lost customers unexpected refunds of customer charges negative publicity and increased operating costs any of which could significantly harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

we rely on internal systems and external systems maintained by manufacturers distributors and other service providers to take and fulfill customer orders handle customer service requests and host certain online activities any interruption or failure of our internal or external systems may prevent us or our service providers from accepting and fulfilling customer orders or cause company and customer data to be unintentionally disclosed our continuing efforts to upgrade and expand our network security and other information systems as well as our highavailability capabilities are costly and problems with the design or implementation of system enhancements may harm our business and our results of operations 

our business operations information technology and communications systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters climate change human error malicious attacks fire power loss telecommunications failures computer viruses and malware computer denial of service attacks terrorist attacks public health emergencies and other events beyond our control for example we shifted to operations under a hybrid workplace model where our workforce spends a portion of their time working in our offices and a portion of their time working from home this model has introduced new execution risks and we may experience longerterm disruptions to our operations as we evolve our workplace model any of which may impair our ability to perform critical functions or could make it considerably more difficult to develop enhance and support our products and services 

in addition our corporate headquarters and other critical business operations are located near major seismic faults in the event of a major natural or manmade disaster our insurance coverage may not completely compensate us for our losses and our future financial results may be materially harmed 

we regularly invest resources to update and improve our internal information technology systems and software platforms should our investments not succeed or if delays or other issues with new or existing internal technology systems and software platforms disrupt our operations our business could be harmed 

we rely on our network infrastructure data hosting public cloud and softwareasaservice providers and internal technology systems for many of our development marketing operational support sales accounting and financial reporting activities we are continually investing resources to update and improve these systems and environments in order to meet existing needs as well as the growing and changing requirements of our business and customers if we experience prolonged delays or unforeseen difficulties in updating and upgrading our systems and architecture we may experience outages and may not be able to deliver certain offerings and develop new offerings and enhancements that we need to remain competitive such improvements and upgrades are often complex costly and time consuming in addition such improvements can be challenging to integrate with our existing technology systems or may uncover problems with our existing technology systems unsuccessful implementation of hardware or software updates and improvements could result in outages disruption in our business operations loss of revenue or damage to our reputation 

if we are unable to develop manage and maintain critical thirdparty business relationships our business may be adversely affected 

our growth is increasingly dependent on the strength of our business relationships and our ability to continue to develop manage and maintain new and existing relationships with thirdparty partners we rely on various thirdparty partners including software and service providers suppliers credit reporting bureaus vendors manufacturers distributors accountants contractors financial institutions core processors licensing partners and development partners among others in many areas of our business in order to deliver our offerings and operate our business credit karma generates revenue from its relationships with financial institution partners which are subject to particular risks that affect their willingness to offer their products on credit karmas platform such as adverse economic conditions and an increasing complexity in the regulatory environment we also rely on third parties to support the operation of our business by maintaining our physical facilities equipment power systems and infrastructure in certain instances these thirdparty relationships are sole source or limited source relationships and can be difficult to replace or substitute depending on the level of integration of the third party’s products or services into or with our offerings andor the general availability of such third party’s products and services in addition there may be few or no alternative thirdparty providers or vendors in the market further there can be no assurance that we will be able to adequately retain thirdparty contractors engaged to help us operate our business 

additionally the business operations of our thirdparty partners have been and could continue to be disrupted by global events like the russiaukraine war and the covid19 pandemic including the effects on their thirdparty partners if our thirdparty partners are unable to help us operate our business our business and financial results may be negatively impacted the failure of third parties to provide acceptable and high quality products services and technologies or to update their products services and technologies may result in a disruption to our business operations and our customers which may reduce our revenues and profits cause us to lose customers and damage our reputation alternative arrangements and services may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all or we may experience business interruptions upon a transition to an alternative partner

although we have strict standards for our suppliers and business partners to comply with the law and company policies regarding workplace and employment practices data use and security environmental compliance intellectual property licensing and other applicable regulatory and compliance requirements we cannot control their daytoday practices any violation of laws or implementation of practices regarded as unethical could result in supply chain disruptions canceled orders terminations of or damage to key relationships and damage to our reputation 

in particular we have relationships with banks credit unions and other financial institutions that support certain critical services we offer to our customers if macroeconomic conditions or other factors cause any of these institutions to fail consolidate stop providing certain services or institute costcutting efforts our business and financial results may suffer and we may be unable to offer those services to our customers 

we increasingly utilize the distribution platforms of third parties like apple’s app store and google’s play store for the distribution of certain of our product offerings although we benefit from the strong brand recognition and large user base of these distribution platforms to attract new customers the platform owners have wide discretion to change the pricing structure terms of service and other policies with respect to us and other developers any adverse changes by these third parties could adversely affect our financial results 

competition for our key employees is intense and we may not be able to attract retain and develop the highly skilled employees we need to support our strategic objectives 

much of our future success depends on the continued service and availability of skilled employees including members of our executive team and those in technical and other key positions experienced individuals with skill sets in software as a service mobile technologies data science artificial intelligence and data security are in high demand and we have faced and will continue to face intense competition globally to attract and retain a diverse workforce with these and other skills that are critical to our success this is especially the case in california and india where a significant number of our employees are located the compensation and incentives we have available to attract retain and motivate employees may not meet the expectations of current and prospective employees as the competition for talent intensifies for example our equity awards may become less effective if our stock price decreases or increases at a slower rate than our talent competitors’ in addition if we were to issue significant additional equity to attract or retain employees the ownership of our existing stockholders would be diluted and our related expenses would increase other factors may make it more challenging for us to continue to successfully attract retain and develop key employees for example current and prospective employees may seek new or different opportunities based on mobility location flexibility or any challenges we face in achieving our publicly stated workforce diversity goals 

if we experience significant product accuracy or quality problems or delays in product launches it may harm our revenue earnings and reputation 

our customers rely on the accuracy of our offerings all of our tax products and many of our nontax products have rigid development timetables that increase the risk of errors in our products and the risk of launch delays our tax preparation software product development cycle is particularly challenging due to the need to incorporate unpredictable and potentially late tax law and tax form changes each year and because our customers expect high levels of accuracy and a timely launch of these products to prepare and file their taxes by the tax filing deadline due to the complexity of our products and the condensed development cycles under which we operate our products may contain errors that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the software or result in incorrect calculations the complexity of the tax laws on which our products are based may also make it difficult for us to consistently deliver offerings that contain the features functionality and level of accuracy that our customers expect when we encounter problems we may be required to modify our code work with state tax administrators to communicate with affected customers assist customers with amendments distribute patches to customers who have already purchased the product and recall or repackage existing product inventory in our distribution channels if we encounter development challenges or discover errors in our products either late in our development cycle or after release it may cause us to delay our product launch date or suspend product availability until such issues can be fixed any major defects launch delays or product suspensions may lead to loss of customers and revenue negative publicity customer and employee dissatisfaction reduced retailer shelf space and promotions and increased operating expenses such as inventory replacement costs legal fees or other payments including those resulting from our accuracy guarantee in our tax preparation products for example an error in our tax products could cause a compliance error for taxpayers including the over or underpayment of their federal or state tax liability while our accuracy guarantee commits us to reimburse penalties and interest paid by customers due solely to calculation errors in our tax preparation products such errors may result in additional burdens on third parties that we may need to address or that may cause us to suspend the availability of our products until such errors are addressed this could also affect our reputation the willingness of customers to use our products and our financial results further as we develop our platform to connect people to experts such as connecting turbotax customers with tax experts through our turbotax live offering or connecting quickbooks customers with bookkeepers through our quickbooks live offering we face the risk that these experts may provide advice that is erroneous ineffective or otherwise unsuitable any such deficiency in the advice given by these experts may cause harm to our customers a loss of customer confidence in our offerings or harm to our reputation or financial results moreover as we continue to incorporate emerging technologies like ai and blockchain into our offerings they may not function as designed or have unintended consequences any of which could subject us to competitive harm legal liability or reputational harm

our international operations are subject to increased risks which may harm our business operating results and financial condition 

in addition to uncertainty about our ability to generate revenues from our foreign operations and expand into international markets there are risks inherent in doing business internationally including 

• different or more restrictive privacy data protection data localization and other laws that could require us to make changes to our products services and operations such as mandating that certain types of data collected in a particular country be stored andor processed within that country 

• difficulties in developing staffing and simultaneously managing a large number of varying foreign operations as a result of distance language and cultural differences 

• stringent local labor laws and regulations 

• credit risk and higher levels of payment fraud 

• profit repatriation restrictions and foreign currency exchange restrictions 

• geopolitical events including natural disasters or severe weather events including those caused or exacerbated by climate change acts of war and terrorism including the russiaukraine war and any related political or economic responses and public health emergencies including divergent governmental responses thereto across the jurisdictions in which we operate 

• compliance with sanctions and import or export regulations including those arising from the russiaukraine war 

• compliance with the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and laws and regulations of other jurisdictions prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials and other third parties 

• antitrust and competition regulations 

• potentially adverse tax developments 

• economic uncertainties relating to european sovereign and other debt 

• trade barriers and changes in trade regulations 

• political or social unrest economic instability repression or human rights issues and 

• risks related to other government regulation or required compliance with local laws 

violations of the rapidly evolving and complex foreign and us laws and regulations that apply to our international operations may result in fines criminal actions or sanctions against us our officers or our broader workforce prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with these laws we cannot be sure that our workforce contractors and agents are in compliance with our policies these risks inherent in our international operations and expansion increase our costs of doing business internationally and may result in harm to our business operating results and financial condition 

climate change may have an impact on our business 

while we seek to mitigate our business risks associated with climate change by establishing robust environmental programs and partnering with organizations that are also focused on mitigating their own climaterelated risks we recognize that there are inherent climaterelated risks wherever business is conducted any of our primary workplace locations may be vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change for example our offices globally have historically experienced and are projected to continue to experience climaterelated events at an increasing frequency including drought water scarcity heat waves cold waves wildfires and resultant air quality impacts and power shutoffs associated with wildfire prevention furthermore it is more difficult to mitigate the impact of these events on our employees to the extent they work from home changing market dynamics global policy developments and the increasing frequency and impact of extreme weather events on critical infrastructure in the us and elsewhere have the potential to disrupt our business the business of our thirdparty suppliers and the business of our customers and may cause us to experience higher attrition losses and additional costs to maintain or resume operations additionally failure to uphold meet or make timely forward progress against our public commitments and goals related to climate action could adversely affect our reputation with suppliers and customers financial performance or ability to recruit and retain talent 

legal and compliance risks 

increasing and changing government regulation of our businesses may harm our operating results 

we are subject to federal state local and international laws and regulations that affect our and our customers activities including without limitation labor advertising and marketing tax financial services data privacy and security electronic funds transfer money transmission lending digital content consumer protection real estate billing ecommerce promotions quality of services intellectual property ownership and infringement import and export requirements antibribery and anti 



tables of contents 

corruption insurance foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions anticompetition environmental health and safety and other regulated activities there have been significant new regulations and heightened focus by the government on many of these areas as we expand our products and services and evolve our business models both domestically and internationally we may become subject to additional government regulation or increased regulatory scrutiny for example the regulation of emerging technologies that we may incorporate into our offerings such as artificial intelligence and blockchain is still an evolving area and it is possible that we could become subject to new regulations that negatively impact our operations and results further regulators both in the us and in other jurisdictions in which we operate may adopt new laws or regulations change existing regulations or their interpretation of existing laws or regulations may differ from ours we are and may continue to be subject to pandemicrelated protocols and restrictions that impact our workforce and workplaces such restrictions have disrupted and may continue to disrupt our business operations and limit our ability to perform critical functions 

the tax preparation industry continues to receive heightened attention from federal and state governments new legislation regulation public policy considerations changes in the cybersecurity environment litigation by the government or private entities changes to or new interpretations of existing laws may result in greater oversight of the tax preparation industry restrict the types of products and services that we can offer or the prices we can charge or otherwise cause us to change the way we operate our tax businesses or offer our tax products and services we may not be able to respond quickly to such regulatory legislative and other developments and these changes may in turn increase our cost of doing business and limit our revenue opportunities in addition if our practices are not consistent with new interpretations of existing laws we may become subject to lawsuits penalties and other liabilities that did not previously apply we are also required to comply with a variety of state revenue agency standards in order to successfully operate our tax preparation and electronic filing services 

changes in stateimposed requirements by one or more of the states including the required use of specific technologies or technology standards may significantly increase the costs of providing those services to our customers and may prevent us from delivering a quality product to our customers in a timely manner 

complex and evolving regulation of privacy and data protection could result in claims changes to our business practices penalties or increased cost of operations or otherwise harm our business 

regulations related to the provision of online services are continually evolving as federal state and foreign governments adopt new or modify existing laws and regulations addressing data privacy cybersecurity the collection processing storage transfer and use of data and the use of ai these include for example the eus general data protection regulation gdpr the california consumer protection act ccpa the california privacy rights act that will amend the ccpa in january 2023 and the virginia consumer data protection act that will become effective in january 2023 these laws and regulations may be inconsistent across jurisdictions and are subject to evolving and differing sometimes conflicting interpretations in our efforts to meet the various data privacy regulations that apply to us we have made and continue to make certain operational changes to our products and business practices if we are unable to engineer products that meet these evolving requirements or help our customers meet their obligations under these or other new data regulations we might experience reduced demand for our offerings further penalties for noncompliance with these laws may be significant 

in addition the evolution of global privacy treaties and frameworks has created compliance uncertainty and increased complexity for example the judicial invalidation of the euus and swissus privacy shield frameworks that we relied on to transfer data has created additional compliance challenges for the transfer of eu personal data to the us while we rely on alternative methods for the transfer of this data ongoing legal challenges to these and other transfer mechanisms could cause us to incur costs or change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business 

other governmental authorities throughout the us and around the world are considering similar types of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection each of these privacy security and data protection laws and regulations could impose significant limitations require changes to our business require notification to customers or workers of a security breach restrict our use or storage of personal information or cause changes in customer purchasing behavior that may make our business more costly less efficient or impossible to conduct and may require us to modify our current or future products or services which may make customers less likely to purchase our products and may harm our future financial results additionally any actual or alleged noncompliance with these laws and regulations could result in negative publicity and subject us to investigations claims or other remedies including demands that we modify or cease existing business practices and expose us to significant fines penalties and other damages we have incurred and may continue to incur significant expenses to comply with existing privacy and security standards and protocols imposed by law regulation industry standards or contractual obligations 

we are frequently a party to litigation and regulatory inquiries which could result in an unfavorable outcome and have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operation and cash flows 

we are subject to various legal proceedings including class action lawsuits claims and regulatory inquiries that have arisen out of the ordinary conduct of our business and are not yet resolved and additional proceedings claims and inquiries may arise in the future the number and significance of these proceedings claims and inquiries may increase as our businesses evolve any proceedings claims or inquiries initiated by or against us whether successful or not may be time consuming result in costly litigation damage awards consent decrees injunctive relief or increased costs of business require us to change our business practices or products require significant amounts of management time result in diversion of significant operations

resources or otherwise harm our business and future financial results for further information about specific litigation see item 3 “legal proceedings” 

third parties claiming that we infringe their proprietary rights may cause us to incur significant legal expenses and prevent us from selling our products 

we may become increasingly subject to infringement claims including patent copyright trade secret and trademark infringement claims litigation may be necessary to determine the validity and scope of the intellectual property rights of others we have received a number of allegations of intellectual property infringement claims in the past and expect to receive more claims in the future based on allegations that our offerings infringe upon the intellectual property held by third parties some of these claims are the subject of pending litigation against us and against some of our customers these claims may involve patent holding companies or other adverse intellectual property owners who have no relevant product revenues of their own and against whom our own intellectual property may provide little or no deterrence the ultimate outcome of any allegation is uncertain and regardless of outcome any such claim with or without merit may be time consuming to defend result in costly litigation divert management’s time and attention from our business require us to stop selling delay shipping or redesign our products or require us to pay monetary damages for royalty or licensing fees or to satisfy indemnification obligations that we have with some of our customers our failure to obtain necessary license or other rights or litigation arising out of intellectual property claims may harm our business 

we are subject to risks associated with information disseminated through our services 

the laws relating to the liability of online services companies for information such as online content disseminated through their services are subject to frequent challenges in spite of settled law in the us claims are made against online services companies by parties who disagree with the content where our online content is accessed on the internet outside of the us challenges may be brought under foreign laws which do not provide the same protections for online services companies as in the us these challenges in either us or foreign jurisdictions may give rise to legal claims alleging defamation libel invasion of privacy negligence copyright or trademark infringement or other theories based on the nature and content of the materials disseminated through the services certain of our services include content generated by users of our online services although this content is not generated by us claims of defamation or other injury may be made against us for that content any costs incurred as a result of this potential liability may harm our business 

financial risks 

our tax business is highly seasonal and our quarterly results fluctuate significantly 

our tax offerings have significant seasonal patterns revenue from income tax preparation products and services has historically been heavily concentrated from november through april as the tax filing deadline for the irs and many states is traditionally in april this seasonality has caused significant fluctuations in our quarterly financial results in addition the effects of these fluctuations have been and may in the future be further exacerbated by changes to the traditional opening and closing dates of the tax season for example the irs and many states extended their tax filing deadlines to may 17 2021 for the 2020 tax year and to july 15 2020 for the 2019 tax year due to conditions created by the pandemic our financial results may also fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year due to a variety of other factors including factors that may affect the timing of revenue recognition these include the timing of the availability of federal and state tax forms from taxing agencies and the ability of those agencies to receive electronic tax return submissions changes to our offerings that result in the inclusion or exclusion of ongoing services changes in product pricing strategies or product sales mix changes in customer behavior and the timing of our discontinuation of support for older product offerings other factors that may affect our quarterly or annual financial results include the timing of acquisitions divestitures and goodwill and acquired intangible asset impairment charges any fluctuations in our operating results may adversely affect our stock price 

if actual customer refunds for our offerings exceed the amount we have reserved our future financial results may be harmed 

like many software companies we refund customers for product returns and subscription cancellations we establish reserves against revenue in our financial statements based on estimated customer refunds we closely monitor this refund activity in an effort to maintain adequate reserves in the past customer refunds have not differed significantly from these reserves however if we experience actual customer refunds or an increase in risks of collecting customer payments that significantly exceed the amount we have reserved it may result in lower net revenue 

unanticipated changes in our income tax rates or other indirect tax may affect our future financial results 

our future effective income tax rates may be favorably or unfavorably affected by unanticipated changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities by changes in our stock price or by changes in tax laws or their interpretation in august 2022 the inflation reduction act of 2022 was signed into law this law among other things provides for a corporate alternative minimum tax on adjusted financial statement income effective for us beginning in fiscal 2024 and an excise tax on corporate stock repurchases effective for our share repurchases after december 31 2022 and we are continuing to evaluate 



tables of contents 

the impact it may have on our financial position and results of operations there are several proposed changes to us and nonus tax legislation and the ultimate enactment of any of them could have a negative impact on our effective tax rate foreign governments may enact tax laws that could result in further changes to global taxation and materially affect our financial position and results of operations in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes these continuous examinations may result in unforeseen taxrelated liabilities which may harm our future financial results 

an increasing number of states and foreign jurisdictions have adopted laws or administrative practices that impose new taxes on all or a portion of gross revenue or other similar amounts or impose additional obligations to collect transaction taxes such as sales consumption value added or similar taxes we may not have sufficient lead time to build systems and processes to collect these taxes properly or at all failure to comply with such laws or administrative practices or a successful assertion by such states or foreign jurisdictions requiring us to collect taxes where we do not could result in material tax liabilities including for past sales as well as penalties and interest 

adverse global economic conditions could harm our business and financial condition 

adverse macroeconomic developments including without limitation inflation slowing growth rising interest rates or recession could negatively affect our business and financial condition these developments or other global events including those related to the russiaukraine war have caused and could in the future cause disruptions and volatility in global financial markets and increased rates of default and bankruptcy and could impact consumer and small business spending and have other unforeseen consequences for example in response to increasing inflation the us federal reserve began to raise interest rates in march 2022 for the first time in over three years and signaled it expects additional rate increases it is difficult to predict the impact of such events on our partners customers members or economic markets more broadly which have been and will continue to be highly dependent upon the actions of governments and businesses in response to macroeconomic events and the effectiveness of those actions in particular because the majority of our revenue is derived from sales within the us economic conditions in the us have an even greater impact on us than companies with a more diverse international presence challenging economic times could cause potential new customers not to purchase or to delay purchasing our products and services and could cause our existing customers to discontinue purchasing or delay upgrades of our existing products and services in addition financial institution partners may again decrease or suspend their activity on credit karma’s platform increased interest rates may make offers from credit karma’s financial institution partners less attractive to credit karma’s members members may decrease their engagement on the platform or their creditworthiness could be negatively impacted reducing members ability to qualify for credit cards and loans any of the foregoing may negatively impact our revenues and future financial results decreased consumer spending levels could also reduce credit and debit card transaction processing volumes causing reductions in our payments revenue poor economic conditions and high unemployment have caused and could in the future cause a significant decrease in the number of tax returns filed which may have a significant effect on the number of tax returns we prepare and file in addition weakness in the enduser consumer and small business markets could negatively affect the cash flow of our distributors and resellers who could in turn delay paying their obligations to us which could increase our credit risk exposure and cause delays in our recognition of revenue or future sales to these customers adverse economic conditions including inflation may also increase the costs of operating our business including vendor supplier and workforce expenses any of these events could harm our business and our future financial results 

we provide capital to small businesses which exposes us to certain risk and may cause us material financial or reputational harm 

we provide capital to qualified small businesses which exposes us to the risk of our borrowers’ inability to repay such loans we have also entered into credit arrangements with financial institutions to obtain the capital we provide under this offering any termination or interruption in the financial institutions’ ability to lend to us could interrupt our ability to provide capital to qualified small businesses further our credit decisioning pricing loss forecasting scoring and other models used to evaluate loan applications may contain errors or may not adequately assess creditworthiness of our borrowers or may be otherwise ineffective resulting in incorrect approvals or denials of loans it is also possible that loan applicants could provide false or incorrect information moreover adverse macroeconomic conditions may have a significant impact on small businesses and may increase the likelihood that our borrowers are unable to repay their loans if any of the foregoing events were to occur our reputation relationships with borrowers collections of loans receivable and financial results could be harmed 

amortization of acquired intangible assets and impairment charges may cause significant fluctuation in our net income 

our acquisitions have resulted in significant expenses including amortization and impairment of acquired technology and other acquired intangible assets and impairment of goodwill total costs and expenses in these categories were 556 million in fiscal 2022 196 million in fiscal 2021 and 28 million in fiscal 2020 although under current accounting rules goodwill is not amortized we may incur impairment charges related to the goodwill already recorded and to goodwill arising out of future acquisitions we test the impairment of goodwill annually in our fourth fiscal quarter or more frequently if indicators of impairment arise the timing of the formal annual test may result in charges to our statement of operations in our fourth fiscal quarter that may not have been reasonably foreseen in prior periods at july 31 2022 we had 137 billion in goodwill and 



tables of contents 

71 billion in net acquired intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheet both of which may be subject to impairment charges in the future new acquisitions and any impairment of the value of acquired intangible assets may have a significant negative impact on our future financial results 

we have incurred indebtedness and may incur other debt in the future which may adversely affect our financial condition and future financial results  

as of july 31 2022 we had an aggregate of 69 billion of indebtedness outstanding under our credit facilities and our senior unsecured notes under the agreements governing our indebtedness we are permitted to incur additional debt this debt and any debt that we may incur in the future may adversely affect our financial condition and future financial results by among other things 

• increasing our vulnerability to downturns in our business to competitive pressures and to adverse economic and industry conditions 

• requiring the dedication of a portion of our expected cash from operations to service our indebtedness thereby reducing the amount of expected cash flow available for other purposes including capital expenditures share repurchases and acquisitions and 

• limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our businesses and our industries 

if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt we may be required among other things to seek additional financing in the debt or equity markets refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness sell selected assets or reduce or delay planned capital operating or investment expenditures such measures may not be sufficient to enable us to service our debt 

additionally the agreements governing our indebtedness impose restrictions on us and require us to comply with certain covenants for example our credit facilities restrict the ability of our subsidiaries to incur indebtedness and require us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios our ability to comply with these ratios may be affected by events beyond our control in addition our credit facilities and the indenture governing our senior unsecured notes limit our ability to create liens our and subsidiaries’ assets and engage in sale and leaseback transactions if we breach any of these covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders or the noteholders as applicable then subject to applicable cure periods any or all of our outstanding indebtedness may be declared immediately due and payable there can be no assurance that any refinancing or additional financing would be available on terms that are favorable or acceptable to us if at all 

under the terms of our outstanding senior unsecured notes we may be required to repurchase the notes for cash prior to their maturity in connection with the occurrence of certain changes of control that are accompanied by certain downgrades in the credit ratings of the notes the repayment obligations under the notes may have the effect of discouraging delaying or preventing a takeover of our company if we were required to pay the notes prior to their scheduled maturity it could have a negative impact on our cash position and liquidity and impair our ability to invest financial resources in other strategic initiatives 

in addition changes by any rating agency to our credit rating may negatively impact the value and liquidity of both our debt and equity securities if our credit ratings are downgraded or other negative action is taken the interest rate payable by us under our unsecured revolving credit facility may increase in addition adverse economic conditions or any downgrades in our credit ratings may affect our ability to obtain additional financing in the future and may negatively impact the terms of any such financing 

we cannot guarantee that our share repurchase program will be fully consummated or that it will enhance longterm stockholder value 

we have a stock repurchase program under which we are authorized to repurchase our common stock the repurchase program does not have an expiration date and we are not obligated to repurchase a specified number or dollar value of shares our repurchase program may be suspended or terminated at any time even if our stock repurchase program is fully implemented it may not enhance longterm stockholder value also the amount timing and execution of our stock repurchase programs may fluctuate based on our priorities for the use of cash for other purposes and because of changes in cash flows tax laws and the market price of our common stock 

our stock price may be volatile and your investment could lose value 

our stock price is subject to changes in recommendations or earnings estimates by financial analysts changes in investors’ or analysts’ valuation measures for our stock our credit ratings and market trends unrelated to our performance furthermore speculation in the press or investment community about our strategic position financial condition results of operations business security of our products or legal proceedings can cause changes in our stock price these factors as well as general economic and political conditions including the effects of a general slowdown in the global economy the covid19 pandemic the russiaukraine war and inflationary pressures and the timing of announcements in the public market regarding new products product enhancements or technological advances by our competitors or us and any announcements by us of acquisitions major transactions or management changes may adversely affect our stock price moreover the covid19 pandemic the russiaukraine war and inflationary pressures have caused significant volatility in the global financial markets

due to the ongoing covid19 pandemic we continue to conduct business with modifications to employee work locations nearly all of our sites are now fully open we are transitioning to a hybrid model where our workforce will spend a portion of their time working in our offices and a portion of their time working from home we continue to evaluate and refine our return to workplace strategy 

the russiaukraine war and related sanctions imposed as a result of this conflict have increased global economic and political uncertainty intuit does not have offices or material business in russia or ukraine 

while we have not experienced significant disruptions to our operations from the covid19 pandemic or the russiaukraine war we are unable to predict the full impact that these events will have on our operations and future financial performance including demand for our offerings impact to our customers and partners actions that may be taken by governmental authorities impact to the overall macroeconomic environment and other factors identified in “risk factors” in item 1a of part i of this annual report

this overview provides a high level discussion of our operating results and some of the trends that affect our business we believe that an understanding of these trends is important in order to understand our financial results for fiscal 2022 as well as our future prospects this summary is not intended to be exhaustive nor is it a substitute for the detailed discussion and analysis provided elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 



industry trends 

artificial intelligence ai is transforming multiple industries including financial technology disruptive startups emerging ecosystems and megaplatforms are harnessing new technology to create personalized experiences deliver datadriven insights and increase speed of service these shifts are creating a more dynamic and highly competitive environment where customer expectations are shifting around the world as more services become digitized and the array of choices continues to increase 

seasonality 

our consumer and proconnect offerings have a significant and distinct seasonal pattern as sales and revenue from our income tax preparation products and services are typically concentrated in the period from november through april this seasonal pattern typically results in higher net revenues during our second and third quarters ending january 31 and april 30 respectively 

in fiscal 2022 the irs began accepting returns on january 24 2022 and the tax filing deadline was april 18 2022 however in fiscal 2021 the irs began accepting returns on february 12 2021 and the tax filing deadline was may 17 2021 in fiscal 2020 the irs began accepting returns on january 27 2020 and the tax filing deadline was july 15 2020 as a result of the extensions of the tax filing deadlines in 2021 and 2020 a significant amount of our fiscal 2021 and 2020 consumer segment and proconnect segment revenues were recognized in the fourth quarter as compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2022 

we expect the seasonality of our consumer and proconnect businesses to continue to have a significant impact on our quarterly financial results in the future 



our growth strategy depends upon our ability to initiate and embrace disruptive technology trends to enter new markets and to drive broad adoption of the products and services we develop and market our future growth also increasingly depends on the strength of our thirdparty business relationships and our ability to continue to develop maintain and strengthen new and existing relationships to remain competitive and continue to grow we are investing significant resources in our product development marketing and sales capabilities and we expect to continue to do so in the future 

as we offer more online services the ongoing operation and availability of our platforms and systems and those of our external service providers is becoming increasingly important because we help customers manage their financial lives we face risks associated with the hosting collection use and retention of personal customer information and data we are investing significant management attention and resources in our information technology infrastructure and in our privacy and security capabilities and we expect to continue to do so in the future 

for our consumer and professional tax offerings we have implemented additional security measures and are continuing to work with state and federal governments to implement industrywide security and antifraud measures including sharing information regarding suspicious filings we received iso 27001 certification for a portion of our systems and we continue to invest in security measures and to work with the broader industry and government to protect our customers against this type of fraud additionally credit karma’s security measures are regularly reviewed and updated

tables of contents 



the most important financial indicators that we use to assess our business are revenue growth for the company as a whole and for each reportable segment operating income growth for the company as a whole earnings per share and cash flow from operations we also track certain nonfinancial drivers of revenue growth and when material identify them in the applicable discussions of segment results below service offerings are a significant part of our business our total service and other revenue was 110 billion or 86 of our total revenue in fiscal 2022 and we expect our total service and other revenue to continue to grow in the future 

key highlights for fiscal 2022 include the following 



1 credit karma revenue for fiscal 2021 includes the operations of credit karma from the acquisition date of december 3 2020 while fiscal 2022 includes the full twelve months of operations 



in preparing our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap we are required to make estimates assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on our net revenue operating income or loss and net income or loss as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets we believe that the estimates assumptions and judgments involved in the following accounting policies have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies 

• revenue recognition 

• business combinations 

• goodwill acquired intangible assets and other longlived assets – impairment assessments 

• legal contingencies 

• accounting for income taxes – estimates of deferred taxes valuation allowances and uncertain tax positions 

our senior management has reviewed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and their disclosure in this annual report on form 10k with the audit and risk committee of our board of directors 



tables of contents 

revenue recognition 

we derive our revenue primarily from the sale of online services such as tax accounting payroll merchant payment processing delivery of qualified links ecommerce marketing automation customer relationship management and packaged desktop software products and desktop software subscriptions our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services in determining how revenue should be recognized a fivestep process is used which requires judgment and estimates within the revenue recognition process the primary judgments include identifying the performance obligations in the contract and determining whether the performance obligations are distinct if any of these judgments were to change it could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue we report in a particular period for additional information see “revenue recognition” in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this annual report 

business combinations 

as described in “description of business and summary of significant accounting policies – business combinations” in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this annual report under the acquisition method of accounting we generally recognize the identifiable assets acquired the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interests in an acquiree at their fair values as of the date of acquisition we measure goodwill as the excess of consideration transferred which we also measure at fair value over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed the acquisition method of accounting requires us to exercise judgment and make significant estimates and assumptions regarding the fair values of the elements of a business combination as of the date of acquisition including the fair values of identifiable intangible assets deferred tax asset valuation allowances liabilities related to uncertain tax positions and contingencies this method allows us to refine these estimates over a oneyear measurement period to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that if known would have affected the measurement of the amounts recognized as of that date if we are required to retroactively adjust provisional amounts that we have recorded for the fair values of assets and liabilities in connection with acquisitions these adjustments could materially decrease our operating income and net income and result in lower asset values on our consolidated balance sheet 

significant estimates and assumptions that we must make in estimating the fair value of acquired technology customer lists and other identifiable intangible assets include future cash flows that we expect to generate from the acquired assets if the subsequent actual results and updated projections of the underlying business activity change compared with the assumptions and projections used to develop these values we could record impairment charges in addition we have estimated the economic lives of certain acquired assets and these lives are used to calculate depreciation and amortization expense if our estimates of the economic lives change depreciation or amortization expenses could be accelerated or slowed 

goodwill acquired intangible assets and other longlived assets – impairment assessments 

we estimate the fair value of acquired intangible assets and other longlived assets that have finite useful lives whenever an event or change in circumstances indicates that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable we test for potential impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives annually in our fourth fiscal quarter or whenever indicators of impairment arise the timing of the annual test may result in charges to our consolidated statement of operations in our fourth fiscal quarter that could not have been reasonably foreseen in prior periods 

as described in “description of business and summary of significant accounting policies – goodwill acquired intangible assets and other longlived assets” in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this annual report in order to estimate the fair value of goodwill we use a weighted combination of a discounted cash flow model known as the income approach and comparisons to publicly traded companies engaged in similar businesses known as the market approach the income approach requires us to use a number of assumptions including market factors specific to the business the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows to be generated by the business over an extended period of time longterm growth rates for the business and a rate of return that considers the relative risk of achieving the cash flows and the time value of money we evaluate cash flows at the reporting unit level although the assumptions we use in our discounted cash flow model are consistent with the assumptions we use to generate our internal strategic plans and forecasts significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of future cash flows from each reporting unit and the relative risk of achieving those cash flows when using the market approach we make judgments about the comparability of publicly traded companies engaged in similar businesses we base our judgments on factors such as size growth rates profitability risk and return on investment we also make judgments when adjusting market multiples of revenue operating income and earnings for these companies to reflect their relative similarity to our own businesses see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this annual report for a summary of goodwill by reportable segment 

we estimate the recoverability of acquired intangible assets and other longlived assets that have finite useful lives by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows that we expect the asset to generate in order to estimate the fair value of those assets we estimate the present value of future cash flows from those assets the key assumptions that we use in our discounted cash flow model are the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows to be generated by the asset over an extended period of time and a rate of return that considers the relative risk of achieving the cash flows and the time value of money significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of future cash flows and the relative risk of achieving those cash flows we also make judgments about the remaining useful lives of acquired intangible assets and other longlived assets that have finite lives see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements in 



tables of contents 

item 8 of this annual report for a summary of cost accumulated amortization and weighted average life in years for our acquired intangible assets 

assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives are complex and often subjective they can be affected by a variety of factors including external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts for example if our future operating results do not meet current forecasts or if we experience a sustained decline in our market capitalization that is determined to be indicative of a reduction in fair value of one or more of our reporting units we may be required to record future impairment charges for goodwill and acquired intangible assets impairment charges could materially decrease our future net income and result in lower asset values on our consolidated balance sheets 

during the fourth quarters of fiscal 2022 fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 we performed our annual goodwill impairment tests using the methodology described in “description of business and summary of significant accounting policies – goodwill acquired intangible assets and other longlived assets” in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this annual report we determined that the estimated fair values of all of our reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying values and that they were not impaired 

legal contingencies 

we are subject to certain legal proceedings as well as demands claims and threatened litigation that arise in the normal course of our business we review the status of each significant matter quarterly and assess our potential financial exposure if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated we record a liability and an expense for the estimated loss if we determine that a loss is possible and the range of the loss can be reasonably determined then we disclose the range of the possible loss significant judgment is required in the determination of whether a potential loss is probable reasonably possible or remote as well as in the determination of whether a potential exposure is reasonably estimable our accruals are based on the best information available at the time as additional information becomes available we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates potential legal liabilities and the revision of estimates of potential legal liabilities could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this annual report for more information 

accounting for income taxes – estimates of deferred taxes valuation allowances and uncertain tax positions 

we estimate our income taxes based on the various jurisdictions where we conduct business significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax rules and the potential for future adjustment of our uncertain tax positions by the united states internal revenue service or other taxing jurisdictions we estimate our current tax liability and assess temporary differences that result from differing treatments of certain items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which we show on our consolidated balance sheet we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized to the extent we believe that realization is not likely we establish a valuation allowance when we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in an accounting period we record a corresponding tax expense in our consolidated statement of operations 

we record a valuation allowance to reflect uncertainties about whether we will be able to utilize our deferred tax assets before they expire we assess the need for an adjustment to the valuation allowance on a quarterly basis the assessment is based on our estimates of future sources of taxable income in the jurisdictions in which we operate and the periods over which our deferred tax assets will be realizable while we have considered future taxable income in assessing the need for a valuation allowance for the periods presented we could in the future be required to increase the valuation allowance to take into account additional deferred tax assets that we may be unable to realize an increase in the valuation allowance could have an adverse impact on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which we record the change 

we recognize and measure benefits for uncertain tax positions using a twostep approach the first step is to evaluate the tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon audit including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes for tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely of being realized upon settlement significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions we evaluate our uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis our evaluations are based upon a number of factors including changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law correspondence with tax authorities during the course of audits and effective settlement of audit issues changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in material increases or decreases in our income tax expense in the period in which we make the change which could have a material impact on our effective tax rate and operating results see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this annual report for more information

on november 1 2021 we terminated our amended and restated credit agreement dated may 2 2019 and entered into a credit agreement with certain institutional lenders with an aggregate principal amount of 57 billion which includes a 1 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that matures on november 1 2026 and a 47 billion unsecured term loan that matures on november 1 2024 on november 1 2021 we borrowed the full 47 billion under the unsecured term loan to fund a portion of the cash consideration for the acquisition of mailchimp the 1 billion unsecured revolving credit facility is available to us for general corporate purposes and serves as a source of liquidity see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this annual report for more information 

our secured revolving credit facility is available to fund a portion of our loans to qualified small businesses at july 31 2022 230 million was outstanding under the secured revolving credit facility see “credit facilities” later in this item 7 for more information 

based on past performance and current expectations we believe that our cash and cash equivalents investments and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet anticipated seasonal working capital needs capital expenditure requirements contractual obligations commitments debt service requirements and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations for at least the next 12 months 

we expect to return excess cash generated by operations to our stockholders through payment of cash dividends after taking into account our operating and strategic cash needs 

on december 3 2020 we acquired credit karma the fair value of the purchase consideration totaled 72 billion and included 34 billion in cash 106 million shares of intuit common stock with a fair value of 38 billion and assumed equity awards for services rendered through the acquisition date of 47 million see business combinations below for more information

 item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend

investment portfolio and interest rate risk 

we actively monitor market conditions and developments specific to the securities in which we invest we believe that we take a conservative approach to investing our funds in that we invest only in highlyrated securities and diversify our portfolio of investments while we believe we take prudent measures to mitigate investmentrelated risks such risks cannot be fully eliminated because of market circumstances that are outside our control 

our investments consist of instruments that meet quality standards that are consistent with our investment policy this policy specifies that except for direct obligations of the united states government securities issued by agencies of the united states government and money market funds we diversify our investments by limiting our holdings with any individual issuer we do not hold derivative financial instruments or european sovereign debt in our portfolio of investments see note 2 and note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this annual report for a summary of the amortized cost and fair value of our investments by type of issue 

our cash equivalents and investments are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates interest rate movements affect the interest income we earn on cash equivalents and investments and the value of those investments at july 31 2022 our cash equivalents and investments totaled 25 billion and had a weighted average pretax yield of 1976 total interest income for fiscal 2022 was 15 million if the federal reserve target rate had increased by 25 basis points from the level of july 31 2022 the value of our investments at that date would have decreased by approximately 2 million if the federal reserve target rate had increased by 100 basis points from the level of july 31 2022 the value of our investments at that date would have decreased by approximately 8 million 

we are also exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates as they affect our 57 billion unsecured credit facility which includes a 1 billion unsecured revolving credit facility and a 47 billion unsecured term loan and our 500 million secured revolving credit facility advances under the unsecured revolving credit facility accrue interest at rates that are equal to the alternate base rate plus a margin that ranges from 00 to 01 or the secured overnight finance rate sofr plus a margin that ranges from 069 to 11 the unsecured term loan accrues interest at rates that are equal to the alternate base rate plus a margin that ranges from 00 to 0125 or sofr plus a margin that ranges from 0625 to 1125 actual margins under the unsecured credit facility are based on our senior debt credit ratings advances under the secured revolving credit facility accrue interest at a rate of adjusted simple sofr plus 15 consequently our interest expense fluctuates with changes in the general level of these interest rates at july 31 2022 no amounts were outstanding under the unsecured revolving credit facility 47 billion was outstanding under the unsecured term loan and 230 million was outstanding under the secured revolving credit facility see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this annual report for more information 

in june 2020 we issued 2 billion of senior unsecured notes together the notes which was comprised of the following 500 million of 0650 notes due in july 2023 500 million of 0950 notes due in july 2025 500 million of 1350 notes due in july 2027 and 500 million of 1650 notes due in july 2030 we carry these notes at face value less unamortized discount and unamortized debt issuance costs on our consolidated balance sheet since these notes bear interest at fixed rates we have no financial statement risk associated with changes in interest rates however the fair value of these notes fluctuates when interest rates change see note 2 and note 8 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this annual report for more information 

impact of foreign currency rate changes 

the functional currencies of our international operating subsidiaries are generally the local currencies we translate the assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries at the exchange rates in effect on the balance sheet date we translate revenue costs and expenses at the average rates of exchange in effect during the period we include translation gains and losses in the stockholders’ equity section of our consolidated balance sheets we include net gains and losses resulting from foreign exchange transactions in interest and other income in our consolidated statements of operations 

since we translate foreign currencies primarily canadian dollars indian rupees and british pounds into us dollars for financial reporting purposes currency fluctuations can have an impact on our financial results the historical impact of currency fluctuations on our financial results has generally been immaterial we believe that our exposure to currency exchange fluctuation risk is not significant because our global subsidiaries invoice customers and satisfy their financial obligations almost exclusively in their local currencies we believe the impact of currency fluctuations will continue to not be significant in the foreseeable future due to the reasons cited above as of july 31 2022 we did not engage in foreign currency hedging activities

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

based upon an evaluation of the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures intuit’s chief executive officer ceo and chief financial officer cfo have concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on form 10k our disclosure controls and procedures as defined under exchange act rules 13a15e and 15d15e were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our exchange act reports is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the securities and exchange commission and is accumulated and communicated to management including the ceo and cfo as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in exchange act rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of july 31 2022 based on the guidelines established in internal control – integrated frame work issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso 

in accordance with guidance issued by the securities and exchange commission companies are permitted to exclude acquisitions from their final assessment of internal control over financial reporting for the first fiscal year in which the acquisition occurred our management’s evaluation of internal control over financial reporting excluded the internal control activities of mailchimp which we acquired on november 1 2021 as discussed in note 7 “business combinations” of the notes to the consolidated financial statements we have included the financial results of this acquisition in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition total revenue subject to mailchimp’s internal control over financial reporting represented six percent of our consolidated total revenues for the fiscal year ended july 31 2022 total assets and net assets subject to mailchimp’s internal control over financial reporting represent less than one percent of both our consolidated total assets and net assets as of july 31 2022 

based on the results of our evaluation our management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of july 31 2022 to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles we reviewed the results of management’s assessment with the audit and risk committee of intuit’s board of directors 

ernst  young llp an independent registered public accounting firm has audited the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of july 31 2022 their report is included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

except as noted above there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the period ended july 31 2022 that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls 

our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer believes that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and that they are effective at the reasonable assurance level however no matter how well conceived and executed a control system can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met the design of any control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs there are also limitations that are inherent in any control system these limitations include the realities that breakdowns can occur because of errors in judgment or mistakes and that controls can be circumvented by individual persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls because of these inherent limitations in a cost effective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected

the markets for software and related services are characterized by rapid technological change shifting customer needs and frequent new product introductions and enhancements continuous investment is required to innovate and develop new products and services as well as enhance existing offerings to be successful in these markets our product development efforts are more important than ever as we pursue our growth strategy 

we develop many of our products and services internally and we have a number of united states and foreign patents and pending applications that relate to various aspects of our products and technology we also supplement our internal development efforts by acquiring or licensing products and technology from third parties and establishing other relationships that enable us to enhance or expand our offerings more rapidly we expect to expand our thirdparty technology relationships as we continue to pursue our growth strategy 

our online offerings and mobile applications have rapid development cycles while our traditional desktop software products tend to have predictable annual development and product release cycles in addition developing consumer and professional tax software and services presents unique challenges because of the demanding development cycle required to accurately incorporate federal and state tax law and tax form changes within a rigid timetable the development timing for our small 



tables of contents 

business payroll and merchant payment processing services offerings varies with business needs and regulatory requirements and the length of the development cycle depends on the scope and complexity of each project 

we continue to make substantial investments in research and development and we expect to focus our future research and development efforts on enhancing existing products and services with financial recommendations personalization and ease of use enabled by ai and other advanced technologies we continue to focus on developing new products and services including new mobile and global offerings and significant research and development efforts for ongoing projects to update the technology platforms for several of our offerings 



our consumer and proconnect offerings have a significant and distinct seasonal pattern as sales and revenue from our income tax preparation products and services are typically concentrated in the period from november through april this seasonal pattern typically results in higher net revenues during our second and third quarters ending january 31 and april 30 respectively 

due to the covid19 pandemic the timing of tax filing seasons for fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 varied significantly in fiscal 2019 the irs began accepting returns on january 28 2019 and the tax filing deadline was april 15 2019 in fiscal 2020 the irs began accepting returns on january 27 2020 and the tax filing deadline was july 15 2020 in fiscal 2021 the irs began accepting returns on february 12 2021 and the tax filing deadline was may 17 2021 these changes to the tax filing seasons impacted our quarterly financial results during fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 

we expect the seasonality of our consumer and proconnect businesses to continue to have a significant impact on our quarterly financial results in the future

overview 

we face intense competition in all of our businesses both domestically and internationally competitive interest and expertise in many of the markets we serve have grown markedly over the past few years and we expect this trend to continue some of our existing competitors have significantly greater financial technical and marketing resources than we do in addition the competitive landscape can shift rapidly as new companies enter and existing companies expand their businesses to include the markets in which we compete this is particularly true for online and mobile products and services where the barriers to entry are lower than they are for desktop software products and services to attract customers many online and mobile competitors are offering free or lowpriced products which we must take into account in our pricing strategies 

given the breadth of the products and services that we offer as a global technology company we compete with the offerings from a variety of companies across a range of industries our most obvious competition comes from other companies that currently offer technology solutions similar to ours in our small business  selfemployed segment we face competition from a variety of companies that provide products or services to address the problems that we help our customers to solve including getting paid faster paying their employees accessing capital and ensuring their books are done right our consumer segment competes with companies that offer products and services to help customers file their taxes better manage their money and reduce their debt we may also face competition from companies with platforms that could be developed to offer competing technology solutions to any of the problems that our customers may face such as facebook amazon and google in addition for many of our products and services other competitive alternatives for customers are thirdparty service providers such as professional accountants and seasonal tax preparation businesses manual tools and processes or generalpurpose software are also important competitive alternatives in some cases a competitor in one of our segments may be our partner in another one of our segments in other cases a company may compete with us in more than one of our segments

 item 1a  risk factors tableend

our businesses routinely encounter and address risks many of which could cause our future results to be materially different than we presently anticipate below we describe significant factors events and uncertainties that make an investment in our securities risky categorized solely for ease of reference as strategic operational legal and compliance and financial risks the following events and consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business growth prospects financial condition results of operations cash flows liquidity credit rating and reputation and the trading price of our common stock could decline these risks are not the only ones we face we could also be affected by other events factors or uncertainties that are presently unknown to us or that we do not currently consider to present significant risks to our business these risks may be amplified by the covid19 pandemic which has caused significant global economic instability and uncertainty the manner in which we respond to future developments as well as our competitors’ reactions to those developments may affect our future operating results 

the covid19 pandemic has caused significant economic instability and uncertainty and the extent to which it will impact our business results of operations and financial condition is uncertain and difficult to predict 

the covid19 pandemic has caused economic instability and uncertainty globally and during its initial phase had a temporary negative impact on our business the pandemic may in the future have a material adverse impact on our business and financial performance the severity and duration of which will depend on many factors beyond our control including the actions of governments businesses and other enterprises in response to the pandemic the effectiveness of those actions and vaccine availability distribution and adoption potential and current negative impacts of the pandemic include but are not limited to the following 

• the extension of federal and state tax filing deadlines for the 2019 and 2020 tax years changed the seasonality of our business making our revenue and operating results more difficult to predict any future regulatory decisions could further increase the difficulty of forecasting our revenue and operating results which could cause our business to materially suffer 

• there are new and more frequent attempts by malicious third parties seeking to take advantage of the pandemic to fraudulently gain access to our systems which could cause us to expend significant resources to remediate and could damage our reputation 

• changes to our business operations and the operations of our thirdparty partners such as increased use of videoconferencing the shift to working from home and the complexity of resuming operations in our offices under a new workplace model has introduced security and execution risks that could cause us to experience substantial financial losses lose the confidence of our customers and government agencies and harm our revenues and earnings 

• potential disruption of services on which we rely to deliver our services to our customers including our thirdparty customer success partners and financial institutions could prevent us or our service providers from delivering critical services to our customers or accepting and fulfilling customer orders any of which could materially and adversely affect our business or reputation 

• increased divergent and changing governmental regulations such as those relating to the reopening of work facilities schools public buildings and businesses could make it considerably more difficult to develop enhance and support our products and services which may cause our results of operations and financial condition to suffer 

• failure to realize some or all of the anticipated benefits of our mergers and acquisitions activities for reasons related to the pandemic may cause us to experience losses that result in significant harm to our operating results or financial condition 

• there could be increased volatility in our stock price related to the pandemic which could result in the loss of some or all of the value of an investment in intuit 

these and other potential negative impacts relating to the covid19 pandemic are described further in the risk factors that follow 

strategic risks 

strategic risks relate to our current and future operating model business plans and growth strategy including the risks associated with the following competitive pressures on our product offerings and business models our ability to adapt to technological changes and global trends our reliance on thirdparty intellectual property and our ability to protect our own intellectual property rights the value of our brand and mergers acquisitions and divestiture activity that may have unanticipated costs and expenses 

we face intense competitive pressures that may harm our operating results 

we face intense competition in all of our businesses and we expect competition to remain intense in the future our competitors and potential competitors range from large and established entities to emerging startups our competitors may 



tables of contents 

introduce superior products and services reduce prices have greater technical marketing and other resources have greater name recognition have larger installed bases of customers have wellestablished relationships with our current and potential customers advertise aggressively or beat us to market with new products and services in addition we face competition from existing companies with large established consumer userbases and broadbased platforms who may change or expand the focus of their business strategies and marketing to target our customers including small businesses tax and personal financial management customers 

we also face competition from companies with a variety of business models including increased competition from providers of free offerings particularly in our tax accounting payments and personal finance platform businesses in order to compete we have also introduced free offerings in several categories but we may not be able to attract customers as effectively as competitors with different business models in addition other providers of free offerings may provide features that we do not offer and customers who have formerly paid for intuit’s products and services may elect to use our competitors’ free offerings instead these competitive factors may diminish our revenue and profitability and harm our ability to acquire and retain customers 

our consumer tax business also faces significant potential competition from the public sector where we face the risk of federal and state taxing authorities proposing revenue raising strategies that involve developing and providing government tax software or other government return preparation systems at public expense these or similar programs may be introduced or expanded in the future which may change the voluntary compliance tax system in ways that could cause us to lose customers and revenue the irs free file program is currently the sole means by which the irs offers tax software directly to taxpayers and in december 2019 the agreement governing the program was amended to eliminate the pledge by the irs that it would not offer a duplicative or competing service under this program the irs has worked with private industry to provide more than 60 million free returns since 2003 utilizing donated private sector tax software and efiling services including software that we donated to the free file program for low and middle income taxpayers at no cost to the government or individual users however we will no longer be participating in the irs free file program and its continuation depends on a number of factors including continued broad public awareness of and access to the free program and continued private industry donations as well as continued government support the current agreement is scheduled to expire in october 2022 our departure from the free file program may increase the likelihood that such program is terminated or is not extended beyond october 2022 if the free file program were to be terminated or the irs were to enter the software development and return preparation space the federal government could become a publicly funded direct competitor of the us tax services industry and of intuit government funded services that curtail or eliminate the role of taxpayers in preparing their own taxes could potentially have material and adverse revenue implications 

future revenue growth depends upon our ability to adapt to technological change as well as global trends in the way customers access software offerings and successfully introduce new and enhanced products services and business models 

we operate in industries that are characterized by rapidly changing technology evolving industry standards and frequent new product introductions we must continue to innovate and develop new products and features to meet the changing needs of our customers and partners and attract and retain talented software developers we need to continue to develop our skills tools and capabilities to capitalize on existing and emerging technologies which requires us to devote significant resources 

our consumer and professional tax businesses depend significantly on revenue from customers who return each year to use our updated tax preparation and filing software and services as our existing products mature encouraging customers to purchase product upgrades becomes more challenging unless new product releases provide features and functionality that have meaningful incremental value we also provide additional customer benefits by utilizing customer data available to us through our existing offerings if we are not able to develop and clearly demonstrate the value of new or upgraded products or services to our customers or effectively utilize our customers’ data to provide them with value our revenues may be harmed in addition as we continue to introduce and expand our new business models including offerings that are free to end users our customers may not perceive value in the additional benefits and services we offer beyond our free offering and may choose not to pay for those additional benefits or we may be unsuccessful in increasing customer adoption of these offerings or our risk profile may change resulting in loss of revenue 

we have devoted significant resources to develop products and services for users of mobile devices but the versions of our products and services developed for these devices may not be compelling to users even if we are able to attract new users through these mobile offerings the amount of revenue that we derive per user from mobile offerings may be less than the revenue that we have historically derived from users of personal computers as new devices and new platforms are continually being released it is difficult to predict the problems we may encounter in developing versions of our products and services for use on mobile devices and we may need to devote significant resources to the creation support and maintenance of such offerings if we are slow to develop products and technologies that are compatible with mobile devices or if our competitors are able to achieve those results more quickly than us we will fail to capture a significant share of an increasingly important portion of the market for online services which could adversely affect our business further legislation or regulatory changes may mandate changes in our products that make them less attractive to users 

in some cases we may expend a significant amount of resources and management attention on offerings that do not ultimately succeed in their markets we have encountered difficulty in launching new products and services in the past if we misjudge customer needs in the future our new products and services may not succeed and our revenues and earnings may 



tables of contents 

be harmed we have also invested and in the future expect to invest in new business models geographies strategies and initiatives such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties including distraction of management from current operations expenses associated with the initiatives and inadequate return on investments because these new initiatives are inherently risky they may not be successful and may harm our financial condition and operating results 

we rely on thirdparty intellectual property in our products and services 

many of our products and services include intellectual property of third parties which we license under agreements that may need to be renewed or renegotiated from time to time we may not be able to obtain licenses to these thirdparty technologies or content on reasonable terms or at all if we are unable to obtain the rights necessary to use this intellectual property in our products and services we may not be able to sell the affected offerings and customers who are currently using the affected product may be disrupted which may in turn harm our future financial results damage our brand and result in customer loss also we and our customers have been and may continue to be subject to infringement claims as a result of the thirdparty intellectual property incorporated in our offerings although we try to mitigate this risk and we may not be ultimately liable for any potential infringement pending claims require us to use significant resources require management attention and could result in loss of customers 

some of our offerings include thirdparty software that is licensed under socalled “open source” licenses some of which may include a requirement that under certain circumstances we make available or grant licenses to any modifications or derivative works we create based upon the open source software although we have established internal review and approval processes to mitigate these risks we cannot be sure that all open source software is submitted for approval prior to use in our products many of the risks associated with usage of open source may not be eliminated and may if not properly addressed harm our business 

our intellectual property rights are valuable and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products services and brand 

our patents trademarks trade secrets copyrights domain names and other intellectual property rights are important assets for us we aggressively protect our intellectual property rights by relying on federal state and common law rights in the us and internationally as well as a variety of administrative procedures we also rely on contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary rights in products and services the efforts that we take to protect our proprietary rights may not always be sufficient or effective protecting our intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming and may not be successful in every location any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business our brand and our ability to compete 

policing unauthorized use and copying of our products is difficult expensive and time consuming current us laws that prohibit copying give us only limited practical protection from software piracy and the laws of many other countries provide very little protection we frequently encounter unauthorized copies of our software being sold through online marketplaces although we continue to evaluate and put in place technology solutions to attempt to lessen the impact of piracy and engage in efforts to educate consumers and public policy leaders on these issues and cooperate with industry groups in their efforts to combat piracy we expect piracy to be a persistent problem that results in lost revenues and increased expenses 

our business depends on our strong reputation and the value of our brands 

developing and maintaining awareness of our brands is critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our existing and future products and services and is an important element in attracting new customers adverse publicity whether or not justified relating to events or activities attributed to us members of our workforce agents third parties we rely on or our users may tarnish our reputation and reduce the value of our brands our brand value also depends on our ability to provide secure and trustworthy products and services as well as our ability to protect and use our customers’ data in a manner that meets their expectations in addition a security incident that results in unauthorized disclosure of our customers’ sensitive data could cause material reputational harm damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity may reduce demand for our products and services and thus have an adverse effect on our future financial results as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of the brands and could also reduce our stock price 

our acquisition and divestiture activities may disrupt our ongoing business may involve increased expenses and may present risks not contemplated at the time of the transactions 

we have acquired and may continue to acquire companies products technologies and talent that complement our strategic direction both in and outside the united states acquisitions such as our acquisition of credit karma involve significant risks and uncertainties including 

• inability to successfully integrate the acquired technology data assets and operations into our business and maintain uniform standards controls policies and procedures 

• inability to realize synergies expected to result from an acquisition 

• disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management 



tables of contents 

• challenges retaining the key employees customers resellers and other business partners of the acquired operation 

• the internal control environment of an acquired entity may not be consistent with our standards or with regulatory requirements and may require significant time and resources to align or rectify 

• unidentified issues not discovered in our due diligence process including product or service quality issues intellectual property issues and legal contingencies 

• failure to successfully further develop an acquired business or technology and any resulting impairment of amounts currently capitalized as intangible assets 

• risks associated with businesses we acquire or invest in which may differ from or be more significant than the risks our other businesses face 

• in the case of foreign acquisitions and investments the impact of particular economic tax currency political legal and regulatory risks associated with specific countries and 

• to the extent we use debt to fund acquisitions or for other purposes our interest expense and leverage will increase significantly and to the extent we issue equity securities as consideration in an acquisition current shareholders’ percentage ownership and earnings per share will be diluted 

we have divested and may in the future divest certain assets or businesses that no longer fit with our strategic direction or growth targets divestitures involve significant risks and uncertainties including 

• inability to find potential buyers on favorable terms 

• failure to effectively transfer liabilities contracts facilities and employees to buyers 

• requirements that we retain or indemnify buyers against certain liabilities and obligations 

• the possibility that we will become subject to thirdparty claims arising out of such divestiture 

• challenges in identifying and separating the intellectual property and data to be divested from the intellectual property and data that we wish to retain 

• inability to reduce fixed costs previously associated with the divested assets or business 

• challenges in collecting the proceeds from any divestiture 

• disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management 

• loss of key employees who leave us as a result of a divestiture and 

• if customers or partners of the divested business do not receive the same level of service from the new owners our other businesses may be adversely affected to the extent that these customers or partners also purchase other products offered by us or otherwise conduct business with our retained business 

in addition any acquisition or divestiture that we announce may not be completed if closing conditions are not satisfied because acquisitions and divestitures are inherently risky our transactions may not be successful and may in some cases harm our operating results or financial condition in particular if we are unable to successfully operate together with credit karma to achieve shared growth opportunities or combine reporting or other processes within the expected time frame such delay may materially and adversely affect the benefits that we expect to achieve as a result of the credit karma acquisition and could result in additional costs or loss of revenue moreover the impact of covid19 adverse changes in market conditions and other factors such as the failure to realize some or all of the anticipated benefits of the credit karma acquisition may cause the acquisition to be dilutive to intuit’s operating earnings per share beyond the first fiscal year after close any dilution of our nongaap diluted earnings per share could cause the price of shares of intuit common stock to decline or grow at a reduced rate 

operational risks 

operational risks arise from internal and external events relating to systems processes and people risks that affect the operation of our businesses include the following potential security incidents privacy and cybersecurity concerns relating to online offerings fraudulent activities by third parties relationships with third parties competition for and retention of key talent issues with our product launches problems with our information technology infrastructure and risks associated with operating internationally 

security incidents improper access to or disclosure of our data or customers’ data or other cyberattacks on our systems could harm our reputation and adversely affect our business 

we host collect use and retain large amounts of sensitive and personal customer and workforce data including credit card information tax return information bank account numbers credit report information login credentials and passwords personal and business financial data and transactions data social security numbers and payroll information as well as our confidential nonpublic business information we use commercially available security technologies and security and business 



tables of contents 

controls to limit access to and use of such sensitive data although we expend significant resources to create security protections designed to shield this data against potential theft and security breaches such measures cannot provide absolute security 

our technologies systems and networks have been subject to and are increasingly likely to continue to be the target of cyberattacks computer viruses ransomware or other malware worms social engineering malicious software programs insider threats and other cybersecurity incidents that could result in the unauthorized release gathering monitoring use loss or destruction of sensitive and personal data of our customers and members of our workforce or intuits sensitive business data or cause temporary or sustained unavailability of our software and systems while we maintain cybersecurity insurance our insurance may not be sufficient to cover all liabilities described herein these types of incidents can be made by individuals groups of hackers and sophisticated organizations including statesponsored organizations or nationstates themselves customers who fail to update their systems continue to run software that we no longer support fail to install security patches on a timely basis or inadequately use security controls create vulnerabilities and make it more difficult for us to detect and prevent these kinds of attacks we are increasingly incorporating open source software into our products and there may be vulnerabilities in open source software that make it susceptible to cyberattacks in addition because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to sensitive information change frequently and are becoming more sophisticated and are often not able to be detected until after a successful attack we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventive measures although this is an industrywide problem that affects software and hardware across platforms it may increasingly affect our offerings because cybercriminals tend to focus their efforts on wellknown offerings that are popular among customers and hold sensitive information and we expect them to continue to do so 

further the security measures that we implement may not be able to prevent unauthorized access to our products and our customers’ account data while we provide resources like mandatory annual security training for our workforce third parties may still be able to fraudulently induce members of our workforce customers or users by social engineering means such as email phishing to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our systems it is also possible that unauthorized access to or disclosure of customer data may occur due to inadequate use of security controls by our customers or members of our workforce accounts created with weak or recycled passwords could allow cyberattackers to gain access to customer data unauthorized persons could gain access to customer accounts if customers do not maintain effective access controls of their systems and software in addition we are experiencing new and more frequent attempts by third parties to use the covid19 pandemic to fraudulently gain access to our systems such as through increased email phishing of our workforce 

criminals may also use stolen identity information obtained outside of our systems to gain unauthorized access to our customers’ data we have experienced such instances in the past and as the accessibility of stolen identity information increases generally we may experience further instances of unauthorized access to our systems through the use of stolen identity information of our customers or members of our workforce in the future further our customers may choose to use the same login credentials across multiple products and services unrelated to our products such customers’ login credentials may be stolen from products offered by thirdparty service providers unrelated to us and the stolen identity information may be used by a malicious third party to access our products which could result in disclosure of confidential information in addition in response to the covid19 pandemic we shifted nearly all our workforce from office locations to work from home environments we expect to resume operations in our offices under a hybrid model where our workforce will spend a portion of their time working in our offices and a portion of their time working from home this model increases our exposure to securityrelated risks due to operational changes such as the increased use of videoconferencing 

our efforts to protect data may also be unsuccessful due to software bugs whether open source or proprietary code breakins workforce member error or other threats that evolve 

further because we have created an ecosystem where customers can have one identity across multiple intuit products a security incident may give access to increased amounts of customer data this may result in disclosure of confidential information loss of customer confidence in our products possible litigation material harm to our reputation and financial condition disruption of our or our customers’ business operations and a decline in our stock price from time to time we detect or receive notices from customers or public or private agencies that they have detected actual or perceived vulnerabilities in our servers our software or thirdparty software components that are distributed with our products or fraudulent activity by unauthorized persons utilizing our products with stolen customer identity information the existence of such vulnerabilities or fraudulent activity even if they do not result in a security breach may undermine customer confidence as well as the confidence of government agencies that regulate our offerings such perceived vulnerabilities could also seriously harm our business by tarnishing our reputation and brand andor limiting the adoption of our products and services and could cause our stock price to decline 

additionally credit karma is subject to an order issued in 2014 by the federal trade commission ftc that among other things requires maintenance of a comprehensive security program relating to the development and management of new and existing products and services and biannual independent security assessments for 20 years from the date of the order to the extent credit karma shares data covered by the order with intuit the order may apply to intuit with respect to such data credit karma’s failure to fulfill the requirements of the ftc’s order could results in fines penalties regulatory inquiries investigations and claims and negatively impact our business and reputation 



tables of contents 

a cybersecurity incident affecting the third parties we rely on could expose us or our customers to a risk of loss or misuse of confidential information and significantly damage our reputation 

we depend on a number of third parties including vendors developers and partners who are critical to our business we or our customers may grant access to customer data to these third parties to help deliver customer benefits or to host certain of our and our customers sensitive and personal data in addition we share sensitive nonpublic business information including for example materials relating to financial business and legal strategies with other vendors in the ordinary course of business 

while we conduct background checks of our workforce conduct reviews of partners developers and vendors and use commercially available technologies to limit access to systems and data it is possible that one or more of these individuals or third parties may misrepresent their intended use of data or may circumvent our controls resulting in accidental or intentional disclosure or misuse of our customer or workforce data further while we conduct due diligence on these third parties with respect to their security and business controls we may not have the ability to effectively monitor or oversee the implementation of these control measures individuals or third parties may be able to circumvent these security and business controls andor exploit vulnerabilities that may exist in these controls resulting in the disclosure or misuse of sensitive business and personal customer or workforce information and data in addition malicious actors may attempt to use the information technology supply chain to compromise our systems by for example introducing malware through software updates 

a security incident involving third parties whom we rely on may have serious negative consequences for our businesses including disclosure of sensitive customer or workforce data or confidential or competitively sensitive information regarding our business including intellectual property and other proprietary data make our products more vulnerable to fraudulent activity cause temporary or sustained unavailability of our software and systems result in possible litigation fines penalties and damages result in loss of customer confidence cause material harm to our reputation and brands lead to further regulation and oversight by federal or state agencies cause adverse financial condition and result in a reduced stock price 

concerns about the current privacy and cybersecurity environment generally could deter current and potential customers from adopting our products and services and damage our reputation 

the continued occurrence of cyberattacks and data breaches on governments businesses and consumers in general indicates that we operate in an external environment where cyberattacks and data breaches are becoming increasingly common if the global cybersecurity environment worsens and there are increased instances of security breaches of thirdparty offerings where consumers’ data and sensitive information is compromised consumers may be less willing to use online offerings particularly offerings like ours in which customers often share sensitive financial data in addition the increased availability of data obtained as a result of breaches of thirdparty offerings could make our own products more vulnerable to fraudulent activity even if our products are not affected directly by such incidents any such incident could damage our reputation and deter current and potential customers from adopting our products and services or lead customers to cease using online and connected software products to transact financial business altogether 

if we are unable to effectively combat the increasing amount and sophistication of fraudulent activities by third parties using our offerings we may suffer losses which may be substantial and lose the confidence of our customers and government agencies and our revenues and earnings may be harmed 

the online tax preparation payroll administration online payments lending and personal financial management industries have been experiencing an increasing amount of fraudulent activities by third parties and those fraudulent activities are becoming increasingly sophisticated although we do not believe that any of this activity is uniquely targeted at our products or businesses this type of fraudulent activity may adversely impact our tax payroll payments lending and personal financial management businesses and is heightened when our workforce is working from home in addition to any losses that may result from such fraud which may be substantial a loss of confidence by our customers or by governmental agencies in our ability to prevent fraudulent activity that is perpetrated through our offerings may seriously harm our business and damage our brand if we cannot adequately combat such fraudulent activity that is perpetrated through our offerings governmental authorities may refuse to allow us to continue to offer such services or these services may otherwise be adversely impacted which could include federal or state tax authorities refusing to allow us to process our customers’ tax returns electronically resulting in a significant adverse impact on our earnings and revenue as fraudulent activities become more pervasive and increasingly sophisticated and fraud detection and prevention measures must become correspondingly more complex to combat them across the various industries in which we operate we may implement risk control mechanisms that could make it more difficult for legitimate customers to obtain and use our products which could result in lost revenue and negatively impact our earnings 

if we fail to process transactions effectively or fail to adequately protect against disputed or potential fraudulent activities our business may be harmed 

our operations process a significant volume and dollar value of transactions on a daily basis especially in our payroll payments and personal financial management businesses despite our efforts to ensure that effective processing systems and controls are in place to handle transactions appropriately it is possible that we may make errors or that funds may be misappropriated due to fraud the likelihood of any such error or misappropriation may increase as we accelerate the speed at which we process transactions the systems supporting our business are comprised of multiple technology platforms that are sometimes difficult to scale if we are unable to effectively manage our systems and processes or if there is an error in our products we may be unable to process customer data in an accurate reliable and timely manner which may harm our

reputation the willingness of customers to use our products and our financial results in our payments processing service business if merchants for whom we process payment transactions are unable to pay refunds due to their customers in connection with disputed or fraudulent merchant transactions we may be required to pay those amounts and our payments may exceed the amount of the customer reserves we have established to make such payments 

business interruption or failure of our information technology and communication systems may impair the availability of our products and services which may damage our reputation and harm our future financial results 

our reputation and ability to attract retain and serve our customers is dependent upon the reliable performance of our products and our underlying technical infrastructure as we continue to grow our online services we become more dependent on the continuing operation and availability of our information technology and communications systems and those of our external service providers including for example thirdparty internetbased or cloud computing services we do not have redundancy for all of our systems and our disaster recovery planning may not account for all eventualities we have designed a significant portion of our software and computer systems to utilize data processing and storage capabilities provided by public cloud providers such as amazon web services if any public cloud service that we use is unavailable to us for any reason our customers may not be able to access certain of our cloud products or features which could significantly impact our operations business and financial results 

failure of our systems or those of our thirdparty service providers may result in interruptions in our service and loss of data or processing capabilities all of which may cause a loss in customers refunds of product fees material harm to our reputation and operating results 

our tax businesses must effectively handle extremely heavy customer demand during critical peak periods which typically occur from january until april of each year we face significant risks in maintaining adequate service levels during these peak periods when we derive a substantial portion of our overall revenue from the tax businesses any interruptions in our online tax preparation or electronic filing service at any time during the tax season particularly during a peak period could result in significantly decreased revenue lost customers unexpected refunds of customer charges negative publicity and increased operating costs any of which could significantly harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

we rely on internal systems and external systems maintained by manufacturers distributors and other service providers to take and fulfill customer orders handle customer service requests and host certain online activities any interruption or failure of our internal or external systems may prevent us or our service providers from accepting and fulfilling customer orders or cause company and customer data to be unintentionally disclosed our continuing efforts to upgrade and expand our network security and other information systems as well as our highavailability capabilities are costly and problems with the design or implementation of system enhancements may harm our business and our results of operations 

our business operations information technology and communications systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters climate change human error malicious attacks fire power loss telecommunications failures computer viruses and malware computer denial of service attacks terrorist attacks public health emergencies and other events beyond our control for example we modified our business practices in response to the covid19 pandemic including employee travel employee work locations and cancellation of physical participation in meetings events and conferences and we expect to resume operations in our offices under a hybrid model where our workforce will spend a portion of their time working in our offices and a portion of their time working from home the implementation of this hybrid model will introduce new execution risks and we may experience longerterm disruptions to our operations as we evolve our workplace model we may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees customers or thirdparty partners we cannot predict how long any such measures will be in place and whether we would reimplement or enhance any such measures in one or more locations in order to respond to the effects of the pandemic or the rules regulations or guidelines of any governmental authority any such measures may impair our ability to perform critical functions or could make it considerably more difficult to develop enhance and support our products and services 

in addition our corporate headquarters and other critical business operations are located near major seismic faults in the event of a major natural or manmade disaster our insurance coverage may not completely compensate us for our losses and our future financial results may be materially harmed 

we regularly invest resources to update and improve our internal information technology systems and software platforms should our investments not succeed or if delays or other issues with new or existing internal technology systems and software platforms disrupt our operations our business could be harmed 

we rely on our network infrastructure data hosting public cloud and softwareasaservice providers and internal technology systems for many of our development marketing operational support sales accounting and financial reporting activities we are continually investing resources to update and improve these systems and environments in order to meet existing needs as well as the growing and changing requirements of our business and customers if we experience prolonged delays or unforeseen difficulties in updating and upgrading our systems and architecture we may experience outages and may not be able to deliver certain offerings and develop new offerings and enhancements that we need to remain competitive such improvements and upgrades are often complex costly and time consuming in addition such improvements can be challenging to integrate with our existing technology systems or may uncover problems with our existing technology systems

unsuccessful implementation of hardware or software updates and improvements could result in outages disruption in our business operations loss of revenue or damage to our reputation 

if we are unable to develop manage and maintain critical thirdparty business relationships our business may be adversely affected 

our growth is increasingly dependent on the strength of our business relationships and our ability to continue to develop manage and maintain new and existing relationships with thirdparty partners we rely on various thirdparty partners including software and service providers suppliers credit reporting bureaus vendors manufacturers distributors accountants contractors financial institutions core processors licensing partners and development partners among others in many areas of our business in order to deliver our offerings and operate our business credit karma generates revenue from its relationships with financial institution partners which are subject to particular risks that affect their willingness to offer their products on credit karmas platform such as adverse economic conditions and an increasing complexity in the regulatory environment we also rely on third parties to support the operation of our business by maintaining our physical facilities equipment power systems and infrastructure in certain instances these thirdparty relationships are sole source or limited source relationships and can be difficult to replace or substitute depending on the level of integration of the third party’s products or services into or with our offerings andor the general availability of such third party’s products and services in addition there may be few or no alternative thirdparty providers or vendors in the market further there can be no assurance that we will be able to adequately retain thirdparty contractors engaged to help us operate our business 

additionally the business operations of our thirdparty partners have been and could continue to be disrupted by the covid19 pandemic and the actions taken in response to it including the pandemic’s effects on their thirdparty partners if our thirdparty partners are unable to help us operate our business as a result of the covid19 pandemic our business and financial results may be negatively impacted for example in the early stages of the covid19 pandemic credit card companies and lenders initially and temporarily reduced or suspended their activity on credit karma’s platform which impacted credit karma’s revenue the failure of third parties to provide acceptable and high quality products services and technologies or to update their products services and technologies may result in a disruption to our business operations and our customers which may reduce our revenues and profits cause us to lose customers and damage our reputation alternative arrangements and services may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all or we may experience business interruptions upon a transition to an alternative partner 

although we have strict standards for our suppliers and business partners to comply with the law and company policies regarding workplace and employment practices data use and security environmental compliance intellectual property licensing and other applicable regulatory and compliance requirements we cannot control their daytoday practices any violation of laws or implementation of practices regarded as unethical could result in supply chain disruptions canceled orders terminations of or damage to key relationships and damage to our reputation 

in particular we have relationships with banks credit unions and other financial institutions that support certain critical services we offer to our customers if macroeconomic conditions or other factors including the effects of the covid19 pandemic cause any of these institutions to fail consolidate stop providing certain services or institute costcutting efforts our business and financial results may suffer and we may be unable to offer those services to our customers 

we increasingly utilize the distribution platforms of third parties like apple’s app store and google’s play store for the distribution of certain of our product offerings although we benefit from the strong brand recognition and large user base of these distribution platforms to attract new customers the platform owners have wide discretion to change the pricing structure terms of service and other policies with respect to us and other developers any adverse changes by these third parties could adversely affect our financial results 

because competition for our key employees is intense we may not be able to attract retain and develop the highly skilled employees we need to support our planned growth 

much of our future success depends on the continued service and availability of skilled personnel including members of our executive team and those in technical and other key positions experienced personnel in the software mobile technologies data science data security and software as a service industries are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense especially in california and india where a significant number of our employees are located also as we strive to continue to adapt to technological change and introduce new and enhanced products and business models we must be able to secure maintain and develop the right quality and quantity of engaged and committed talent the incentives we have available to attract retain and motivate employees provided by our equity awards may become less effective and if we were to issue significant equity to attract additional employees the ownership of our existing stockholders would be diluted although we strive to be an employer of choice we may not be able to continue to successfully attract retain and develop key personnel which may cause our business to suffer moreover as social and economic conditions evolve from the covid19 pandemic current and prospective employees may seek new or different opportunities based on factors such as compensation benefits mobility and flexibility that are different from what we offer making it difficult to attract and retain them

if we experience significant product accuracy or quality problems or delays in product launches it may harm our revenue earnings and reputation 

all of our tax products and many of our nontax products have rigid development timetables that increase the risk of errors in our products and the risk of launch delays our tax preparation software product development cycle is particularly challenging due to the need to incorporate unpredictable and potentially late tax law and tax form changes each year and because our customers expect high levels of accuracy and a timely launch of these products to prepare and file their taxes by the tax filing deadline due to the complexity of our products and the condensed development cycles under which we operate our products may contain errors that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the software or result in incorrect calculations the complexity of the tax laws on which our products are based may also make it difficult for us to consistently deliver offerings that contain the features functionality and level of accuracy that our customers expect when we encounter problems we may be required to modify our code work with state tax administrators to communicate with affected customers assist customers with amendments distribute patches to customers who have already purchased the product and recall or repackage existing product inventory in our distribution channels if we encounter development challenges or discover errors in our products either late in our development cycle or after release it may cause us to delay our product launch date or suspend product availability until such issues can be fixed any major defects launch delays or product suspensions may lead to loss of customers and revenue negative publicity customer and employee dissatisfaction reduced retailer shelf space and promotions and increased operating expenses such as inventory replacement costs legal fees or other payments including those resulting from our accuracy guarantee in our tax preparation products for example an error in our tax products could cause a compliance error for taxpayers including the over or underpayment of their federal or state tax liability while our accuracy guarantee commits us to reimburse penalties and interest paid by customers due solely to calculation errors in our tax preparation products such errors may result in additional burdens on third parties that we may need to address or that may cause us to suspend the availability of our products until such errors are addressed this could also affect our reputation the willingness of customers to use our products and our financial results further as we develop our platform to connect people to experts such as connecting turbotax customers with tax experts through our turbotax live offering or connecting quickbooks customers with bookkeepers through our quickbooks live offering we face the risk that these experts may provide advice that is erroneous ineffective or otherwise unsuitable any such deficiency in the advice given by these experts may cause harm to our customers a loss of customer confidence in our offerings or harm to our reputation or financial results 

our international operations are subject to increased risks which may harm our business operating results and financial condition 

in addition to uncertainty about our ability to generate revenues from our foreign operations and expand into international markets there are risks inherent in doing business internationally including 

• different or more restrictive privacy data protection data localization and other laws that could require us to make changes to our products services and operations such as mandating that certain types of data collected in a particular country be stored andor processed within that country 

• difficulties in developing staffing and simultaneously managing a large number of varying foreign operations as a result of distance language and cultural differences 

• stringent local labor laws and regulations 

• credit risk and higher levels of payment fraud 

• profit repatriation restrictions and foreign currency exchange restrictions 

• geopolitical events including natural disasters acts of war and terrorism and public health emergencies including divergent governmental responses thereto across the jurisdictions in which we operate 

• import or export regulations 

• compliance with the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and laws and regulations of other jurisdictions prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials and other third parties 

• antitrust and competition regulations 

• potentially adverse tax developments 

• economic uncertainties relating to european sovereign and other debt 

• trade barriers and changes in trade regulations 

• political or social unrest economic instability repression or human rights issues and 

• risks related to other government regulation or required compliance with local laws 

violations of the rapidly evolving and complex foreign and us laws and regulations that apply to our international operations may result in fines criminal actions or sanctions against us our officers or our broader workforce prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with these laws we cannot be sure that our workforce contractors and agents are in compliance with our policies 



tables of contents 

these risks inherent in our international operations and expansion increase our costs of doing business internationally and may result in harm to our business operating results and financial condition 

legal and compliance risks 

legal and compliance risks arise from change in the government and regulatory environment including complex and evolving regulations relating to privacy and data security potential litigation regulatory inquiries and intellectual property infringement claims 

increased government regulation of our businesses or changes to existing regulations may harm our operating results 

the company is subject to federal state local and international laws and regulations that affect the company’s activities including without limitation areas of labor advertising tax financial services data privacy and security electronic funds transfer money transmission lending digital content consumer protection real estate billing ecommerce promotions quality of services intellectual property ownership and infringement import and export requirements anticorruption foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions anticompetition environmental health and safety and other regulated activities there have been significant new regulations and heightened focus by the government on many of these areas as well as in areas such as insurance and privacy as we expand our products and services and revise our business models both domestically and internationally we may become subject to additional government regulation or increased regulatory scrutiny for example in april 2020 one of our subsidiaries became a small business administration sba approved lender under the sba’s recently established paycheck protection program “ppp” authorized by the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act further regulators both in the us and in other jurisdictions in which we operate may adopt new laws or regulations change existing regulations or their interpretation of existing laws or regulations may differ from ours in response to the covid19 pandemic federal state local and foreign governmental authorities have imposed and may continue to impose protocols and restrictions intended to contain the spread of the virus including limitations on the reopening of work facilities schools public buildings and businesses quarantines lockdowns and travel restrictions such restrictions have disrupted and may continue to disrupt our business operations and limit our ability to perform critical functions 

the tax preparation industry continues to receive heightened attention from federal and state governments new legislation regulation public policy considerations changes in the cybersecurity environment litigation by the government or private entities changes to or new interpretations of existing laws may result in greater oversight of the tax preparation industry restrict the types of products and services that we can offer or the prices we can charge or otherwise cause us to change the way we operate our tax businesses or offer our tax products and services we may not be able to respond quickly to such regulatory legislative and other developments and these changes may in turn increase our cost of doing business and limit our revenue opportunities in addition if our practices are not consistent with new interpretations of existing laws we may become subject to lawsuits penalties and other liabilities that did not previously apply we are also required to comply with a variety of state revenue agency standards in order to successfully operate our tax preparation and electronic filing services 

changes in stateimposed requirements by one or more of the states including the required use of specific technologies or technology standards may significantly increase the costs of providing those services to our customers and may prevent us from delivering a quality product to our customers in a timely manner 

complex and evolving us and international laws and regulation regarding privacy and data protection could result in claims changes to our business practices penalties or increased cost of operations or otherwise harm our business 

regulations related to the provision of online services is evolving as federal state and foreign governments continue to adopt new or modify existing laws and regulations addressing data privacy and the collection processing storage transfer and use of data this includes for example the eus general data protection regulation the california consumer protection act the california privacy rights act and the virginia consumer data protection act which will become effective in january 2023 in our efforts to meet the gdpr ccpa and other data privacy regulations we have made and continue to make certain operational changes to our products and business practices if we are unable to engineer products that meet these evolving requirements or help our customers meet their obligations under these or other new data regulations we might experience reduced demand for our offerings further penalties for noncompliance with these laws may be significant 

in addition the evolution of global privacy treaties and frameworks has created compliance uncertainty and increased complexity for example the judicial invalidation of the euus and swissus privacy shield frameworks that we relied on to transfer data has created additional compliance challenges for the transfer of eu personal data to the us while we rely on alternative methods for the transfer of this data ongoing legal challenges to these and other transfer mechanisms could cause us to incur costs or change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business 

other governmental authorities throughout the us and around the world are considering similar types of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection each of these privacy security and data protection laws and regulations could impose significant limitations require changes to our business require notification to customers or workers of a security breach restrict our use or storage of personal information or cause changes in customer purchasing behavior which may make our business more costly less efficient or impossible to conduct and may require us to modify our current or future products 



tables of contents 

or services which may make customers less likely to purchase our products and may harm our future financial results additionally any actual or alleged noncompliance with these laws and regulations could result in negative publicity and subject us to investigations claims or other remedies including demands that we modify or cease existing business practices and expose us to significant fines penalties and other damages we have incurred and may continue to incur significant expenses to comply with existing privacy and security standards and protocols imposed by law regulation industry standards or contractual obligations 

we are frequently a party to litigation and regulatory inquiries which could result in an unfavorable outcome and have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operation and cash flows 

we are subject to various legal proceedings including class action lawsuits claims and regulatory inquiries that have arisen out of the ordinary conduct of our business and are not yet resolved and additional claims and inquiries may arise in the future the number and significance of these claims and inquiries may increase as our businesses evolve any proceedings claims or inquiries initiated by or against us whether successful or not may be time consuming result in costly litigation damage awards consent decrees injunctive relief or increased costs of business require us to change our business practices or products require significant amounts of management time result in diversion of significant operations resources or otherwise harm our business and future financial results for further information about specific litigation see item 3 “legal proceedings” 

third parties claiming that we infringe their proprietary rights may cause us to incur significant legal expenses and prevent us from selling our products 

we may become increasingly subject to infringement claims including patent copyright trade secret and trademark infringement claims litigation may be necessary to determine the validity and scope of the intellectual property rights of others we have received a number of allegations of intellectual property infringement claims in the past and expect to receive more claims in the future based on allegations that our offerings infringe upon the intellectual property held by third parties some of these claims are the subject of pending litigation against us and against some of our customers these claims may involve patent holding companies or other adverse intellectual property owners who have no relevant product revenues of their own and against whom our own intellectual property may provide little or no deterrence the ultimate outcome of any allegation is uncertain and regardless of outcome any such claim with or without merit may be time consuming to defend result in costly litigation divert management’s time and attention from our business require us to stop selling delay shipping or redesign our products or require us to pay monetary damages for royalty or licensing fees or to satisfy indemnification obligations that we have with some of our customers our failure to obtain necessary license or other rights or litigation arising out of intellectual property claims may harm our business 

we are subject to risks associated with information disseminated through our services 

the laws relating to the liability of online services companies for information such as online content disseminated through their services are subject to frequent challenges in spite of settled law in the us claims are made against online services companies by parties who disagree with the content where our online content is accessed on the internet outside of the us challenges may be brought under foreign laws which do not provide the same protections for online services companies as in the us these challenges in either us or foreign jurisdictions may give rise to legal claims alleging defamation libel invasion of privacy negligence copyright or trademark infringement or other theories based on the nature and content of the materials disseminated through the services certain of our services include content generated by users of our online services although this content is not generated by us claims of defamation or other injury may be made against us for that content any costs incurred as a result of this potential liability may harm our business 

financial risks 

financial risks relate to our ability to meet financial obligations and mitigate exposure to financial impacts to our businesses or our offerings financial risks arise from the following seasonality excessive subscription cancellations and product returns unanticipated changes in income tax rates adverse global macroeconomic conditions credit risks fluctuations in our net income indebtedness and the fluctuation of our stock price 

our tax business is highly seasonal and our quarterly results fluctuate significantly 

our tax offerings have significant seasonal patterns revenue from income tax preparation products and services has historically been heavily concentrated from november through april and this seasonality has been affected by changes to the opening and closing dates of the tax season for example the irs and many states extended their tax filing deadlines to may 17 2021 for the 2020 tax year and to july 15 2020 for the 2019 tax year this seasonality has caused significant fluctuations in our quarterly financial results our financial results may also fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year due to a variety of factors including factors that may affect the timing of revenue recognition these include the timing of the availability of federal and state tax forms from taxing agencies and the ability of those agencies to receive electronic tax return submissions changes to our offerings that result in the inclusion or exclusion of ongoing services changes in product pricing strategies or product sales mix changes in customer behavior and the timing of our discontinuation of support for older product offerings other factors that may affect our quarterly or annual financial results include the timing of acquisitions divestitures and 



tables of contents 

goodwill and acquired intangible asset impairment charges any fluctuations in our operating results may adversely affect our stock price 

if actual customer refunds for our offerings exceed the amount we have reserved our future financial results may be harmed 

like many software companies we refund customers for product returns and subscription cancellations we establish reserves against revenue in our financial statements based on estimated customer refunds we closely monitor this refund activity in an effort to maintain adequate reserves in the past customer refunds have not differed significantly from these reserves however if we experience actual customer refunds or an increase in risks of collecting customer payments that significantly exceed the amount we have reserved it may result in lower net revenue 

unanticipated changes in our income tax rates or other indirect tax may affect our future financial results 

our future effective income tax rates may be favorably or unfavorably affected by unanticipated changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities by changes in our stock price or by changes in tax laws or their interpretation there are several pending proposed changes to us and nonus tax legislation and the ultimate enactment of any of them could have a negative impact on our effective tax rate foreign governments may enact tax laws that could result in further changes to global taxation and materially affect our financial position and results of operations in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes these continuous examinations may result in unforeseen taxrelated liabilities which may harm our future financial results 

an increasing number of states and foreign jurisdictions have adopted laws or administrative practices that impose new taxes on all or a portion of gross revenue or other similar amounts or impose additional obligations to collect transaction taxes such as sales consumption value added or similar taxes we may not have sufficient lead time to build systems and processes to collect these taxes properly or at all failure to comply with such laws or administrative practices or a successful assertion by such states or foreign jurisdictions requiring us to collect taxes where we do not could result in material tax liabilities including for past sales as well as penalties and interest 

adverse global economic conditions could harm our business and financial condition 

adverse macroeconomic developments could negatively affect our business and financial condition adverse global economic events have caused and could in the future cause disruptions and volatility in global financial markets and increased rates of default and bankruptcy and could impact consumer and small business spending in particular because the majority of our revenue is derived from sales within the us economic conditions in the us have an even greater impact on us than companies with a more diverse international presence challenging economic times could cause potential new customers not to purchase or to delay purchasing our products and services and could cause our existing customers to discontinue purchasing or delay upgrades of our existing products and services in addition financial institution partners may again decrease or suspend their activity on credit karma’s platform credit karma’s members may decrease their engagement on the platform or their creditworthiness could be negatively impacted reducing members ability to qualify for credit cards and loans any of the foregoing may negatively impact our revenues and future financial results decreased consumer spending levels could also reduce credit and debit card transaction processing volumes causing reductions in our payments revenue poor economic conditions and high unemployment have caused and could in the future cause a significant decrease in the number of tax returns filed which may have a significant effect on the number of tax returns we prepare and file in addition weakness in the enduser consumer and small business markets could negatively affect the cash flow of our distributors and resellers who could in turn delay paying their obligations to us which could increase our credit risk exposure and cause delays in our recognition of revenue or future sales to these customers any of these events could harm our business and our future financial results 

the covid19 pandemic and the actions taken in response to it have significantly increased economic and demand uncertainty accordingly the risks described in the paragraph above may be more likely to materialize any of which could harm our business and our future financial results 

we provide capital to small businesses which exposes us to certain risk and may cause us material financial or reputational harm 

we provide capital to qualified small businesses which exposes us to the risk of our borrowers’ inability to repay such loans we have also entered into credit arrangements with financial institutions to obtain the capital we provide under this offering any termination or interruption in the financial institutions’ ability to lend to us could interrupt our ability to provide capital to qualified small businesses further our credit decisioning pricing loss forecasting scoring and other models used to evaluate loan applications may contain errors or may not adequately assess creditworthiness of our borrowers or may be otherwise ineffective resulting in incorrect approvals or denials of loans it is also possible that loan applicants could provide false or incorrect information moreover the covid19 pandemic and the actions taken in response to it have had a significant impact on small businesses and may increase the likelihood that our borrowers are unable to repay their loans if any of the foregoing events were to occur our reputation relationships with borrowers collections of loans receivable and financial results could be harmed in addition one of our subsidiaries is a lender and a servicer under the ppp to support our small business customers and other eligible applicants during the pandemic our participation in this program exposes us to many of the risks described 



tables of contents 

above and additional risks such as borrower default the sba declining to forgive or honor its guarantee with respect to ppp loans and litigation or other disputes with borrowers or others related to our ppp activities 

amortization of acquired intangible assets and impairment charges may cause significant fluctuation in our net income 

our acquisitions have resulted in significant expenses including amortization and impairment of acquired technology and other acquired intangible assets and impairment of goodwill total costs and expenses in these categories were 196 million in fiscal 2021 28 million in fiscal 2020 and 26 million in fiscal 2019 although under current accounting rules goodwill is not amortized we may incur impairment charges related to the goodwill already recorded and to goodwill arising out of future acquisitions we test the impairment of goodwill annually in our fourth fiscal quarter or more frequently if indicators of impairment arise the timing of the formal annual test may result in charges to our statement of operations in our fourth fiscal quarter that may not have been reasonably foreseen in prior periods at july 31 2021 we had 56 billion in goodwill and 33 billion in net acquired intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheet both of which may be subject to impairment charges in the future new acquisitions and any impairment of the value of acquired intangible assets may have a significant negative impact on our future financial results 

we have incurred indebtedness and may incur other debt in the future which may adversely affect our financial condition and future financial results 

as of july 31 2021 we had an aggregate of 20 billion of indebtedness outstanding under our credit facilities and our senior unsecured notes under the agreements governing our indebtedness we are permitted to incur additional debt this debt and any debt that we may incur in the future may adversely affect our financial condition and future financial results by among other things 

• increasing our vulnerability to downturns in our business to competitive pressures and to adverse economic and industry conditions 

• requiring the dedication of a portion of our expected cash from operations to service our indebtedness thereby reducing the amount of expected cash flow available for other purposes including capital expenditures share repurchases and acquisitions and 

• limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our businesses and our industries 

if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt we may be required among other things to seek additional financing in the debt or equity markets refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness sell selected assets or reduce or delay planned capital operating or investment expenditures such measures may not be sufficient to enable us to service our debt 

additionally the agreements governing our indebtedness impose restrictions on us and require us to comply with certain covenants for example our credit facilities restrict the ability of our subsidiaries to incur indebtedness and require us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios our ability to comply with these ratios may be affected by events beyond our control in addition our credit facilities and the indenture governing our senior unsecured notes limit our ability to create liens our and subsidiaries’ assets and engage in sale and leaseback transactions if we breach any of these covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders or the noteholders as applicable then subject to applicable cure periods any or all of our outstanding indebtedness may be declared immediately due and payable there can be no assurance that any refinancing or additional financing would be available on terms that are favorable or acceptable to us if at all 

under the terms of our outstanding senior unsecured notes we may be required to repurchase the notes for cash prior to their maturity in connection with the occurrence of certain changes of control that are accompanied by certain downgrades in the credit ratings of the notes the repayment obligations under the notes may have the effect of discouraging delaying or preventing a takeover of our company if we were required to pay the notes prior to their scheduled maturity it could have a negative impact on our cash position and liquidity and impair our ability to invest financial resources in other strategic initiatives 

in addition changes by any rating agency to our credit rating may negatively impact the value and liquidity of both our debt and equity securities if our credit ratings are downgraded or other negative action is taken the interest rate payable by us under our unsecured revolving credit facility may increase in addition any downgrades in our credit ratings may affect our ability to obtain additional financing in the future and may negatively impact the terms of any such financing 

we cannot guarantee that our share repurchase program will be fully consummated or that it will enhance longterm stockholder value 

we have a stock repurchase program under which we are authorized to repurchase our common stock the repurchase program does not have an expiration date and we are not obligated to repurchase a specified number or dollar value of shares our repurchase program may be suspended or terminated at any time even if our stock repurchase program is fully implemented it may not enhance longterm stockholder value also the amount timing and execution of our stock repurchase programs may fluctuate based on our priorities for the use of cash for other purposes and because of changes in cash flows tax laws and the market price of our common stock

due to the covid19 pandemic we continue to conduct business with substantial modifications to employee work locations and employee travel among other modifications in june 2021 a small number of employees started returning to work locations on a limited basis while we have not experienced significant disruptions to our operations from the covid19 pandemic we are unable to predict the full impact that the covid19 pandemic will have on our operations and future financial performance including demand for our offerings impact to our customers and partners actions that may be taken by governmental authorities and other factors identified in “risk factors” in item 1a of part i of this report 

in april 2020 intuit was approved as a nonbank small business administration lender for the paycheck protection program ppp the ppp was authorized under the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act cares act to provide small businesses loans to pay payroll and group health costs salaries and commissions mortgage and rent payments utilities and interest on other debt which is designed to provide assistance to small businesses during the covid19 pandemic 

in august 2020 we reorganized certain technology and customer success functions that support and benefit our overall platform additionally certain legal facility and employee service costs are now managed at the corporate level as a result these costs are no longer included in segment operating income and are now included in other corporate expenses for the twelve months ended july 31 2020 and 2019 we reclassified 180 million and 172 million from small business  selfemployed 121 million and 78 million from consumer and 13 million and 12 million from proconnect to other corporate expenses in august 2020 we also renamed our strategic partner segment as the proconnect segment this segment continues to serve professional accountants 

in fiscal 2021 we acquired credit karma we have included their results of operations in our consolidated results of operations from the date of acquisition credit karma operates as a separate reportable segment segment operating income for credit karma includes all direct expenses related to selling and marketing product development and general and administrative which is different from our other reportable segments see note 6 in item 8 of this annual report for more information 



this overview provides a high level discussion of our operating results and some of the trends that affect our business we believe that an understanding of these trends is important in order to understand our financial results for fiscal 2021 as well as our future prospects this summary is not intended to be exhaustive nor is it a substitute for the detailed discussion and analysis provided elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k

seasonality 

our consumer and proconnect offerings have a significant and distinct seasonal pattern as sales and revenue from our income tax preparation products and services are typically concentrated in the period from november through april this seasonal pattern typically results in higher net revenues during our second and third quarters ending january 31 and april 30 respectively 

due to the covid19 pandemic the timing of tax filing seasons for fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 varied significantly in fiscal 2019 the irs began accepting returns on january 28 2019 and the tax filing deadline was april 15 2019 in fiscal 2020 the irs began accepting returns on january 27 2020 and the tax filing deadline was july 15 2020 in fiscal 2021 the irs began accepting returns on february 12 2021 and the tax filing deadline was may 17 2021 these changes to the tax filing seasons impacted our quarterly financial results during fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 

we expect the seasonality of our consumer and proconnect businesses to continue to have a significant impact on our quarterly financial results in the future 



our growth strategy depends upon our ability to initiate and embrace disruptive technology trends to enter new markets and to drive broad adoption of the products and services we develop and market our future growth also increasingly depends on the strength of our thirdparty business relationships and our ability to continue to develop maintain and strengthen new and existing relationships to remain competitive and continue to grow we are investing significant resources in our product development marketing and sales capabilities and we expect to continue to do so in the future 

as we offer more online services the ongoing operation and availability of our platforms and systems and those of our external service providers is becoming increasingly important because we help customers manage their financial lives we face risks associated with the hosting collection use and retention of personal customer information and data we are investing significant management attention and resources in our information technology infrastructure and in our privacy and security capabilities and we expect to continue to do so in the future 

for our consumer and professional tax offerings we have implemented additional security measures and are continuing to work with state and federal governments to implement industrywide security and antifraud measures including sharing information regarding suspicious filings we received iso 27001 certification for a portion of our systems and we continue to invest in security measures and to work with the broader industry and government to protect our customers against this type of fraud additionally credit karma’s security measures are regularly reviewed and updated 

for a complete discussion of the most significant risks and uncertainties affecting our business please see “forwardlooking statements” immediately preceding part i and “risk factors” in item 1a of part i of this report 



tables of contents 



the most important financial indicators that we use to assess our business are revenue growth for the company as a whole and for each reportable segment operating income growth for the company as a whole earnings per share and cash flow from operations we also track certain nonfinancial drivers of revenue growth and when material identify them in the applicable discussions of segment results below service offerings are a significant part of our business our total service and other revenue was 79 billion or 82 of our total revenue in fiscal 2021 and we expect our total service and other revenue to continue to grow in the future 

key highlights for fiscal 2021 include the following 



we ended fiscal 2021 with cash cash equivalents and investments totaling 39 billion 



in preparing our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap we are required to make estimates assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on our net revenue operating income or loss and net income or loss as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets we believe that the estimates assumptions and judgments involved in the following accounting policies have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies 

• revenue recognition 

• business combinations 

• goodwill acquired intangible assets and other longlived assets – impairment assessments 

• legal contingencies 

• accounting for income taxes – estimates of deferred taxes valuation allowances and uncertain tax positions 

our senior management has reviewed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and their disclosure in this annual report on form 10k with the audit and risk committee of our board of directors 

revenue recognition 

we derive our revenue primarily from the sale of online services such as tax accounting payroll merchant payment processing delivery of qualified links and packaged desktop software products and desktop software subscriptions our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services in determining how revenue should be recognized a fivestep process is used which requires judgment and estimates within the revenue recognition process the primary judgments include identifying the performance obligations in the contract and determining whether the performance obligations are distinct if any of these judgments were to change it could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount

of revenue we report in a particular period for additional information see “revenue recognition” in note 1 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report 

business combinations 

as described in “description of business and summary of significant accounting policies – business combinations” in note 1 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report under the acquisition method of accounting we generally recognize the identifiable assets acquired the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interests in an acquiree at their fair values as of the date of acquisition we measure goodwill as the excess of consideration transferred which we also measure at fair value over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed the acquisition method of accounting requires us to exercise judgment and make significant estimates and assumptions regarding the fair values of the elements of a business combination as of the date of acquisition including the fair values of identifiable intangible assets deferred tax asset valuation allowances liabilities related to uncertain tax positions and contingencies this method also requires us to refine these estimates over a oneyear measurement period to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that if known would have affected the measurement of the amounts recognized as of that date if we are required to retroactively adjust provisional amounts that we have recorded for the fair values of assets and liabilities in connection with acquisitions these adjustments could materially decrease our operating income and net income and result in lower asset values on our consolidated balance sheet 

significant estimates and assumptions that we must make in estimating the fair value of acquired technology customer lists and other identifiable intangible assets include future cash flows that we expect to generate from the acquired assets if the subsequent actual results and updated projections of the underlying business activity change compared with the assumptions and projections used to develop these values we could record impairment charges in addition we have estimated the economic lives of certain acquired assets and these lives are used to calculate depreciation and amortization expense if our estimates of the economic lives change depreciation or amortization expenses could be accelerated or slowed 

goodwill acquired intangible assets and other longlived assets – impairment assessments 

we estimate the fair value of acquired intangible assets and other longlived assets that have finite useful lives whenever an event or change in circumstances indicates that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable we test for potential impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives annually in our fourth fiscal quarter or whenever indicators of impairment arise the timing of the annual test may result in charges to our consolidated statement of operations in our fourth fiscal quarter that could not have been reasonably foreseen in prior periods 

as described in “description of business and summary of significant accounting policies – goodwill acquired intangible assets and other longlived assets” in note 1 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report in order to estimate the fair value of goodwill we use a weighted combination of a discounted cash flow model known as the income approach and comparisons to publicly traded companies engaged in similar businesses known as the market approach the income approach requires us to use a number of assumptions including market factors specific to the business the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows to be generated by the business over an extended period of time longterm growth rates for the business and a rate of return that considers the relative risk of achieving the cash flows and the time value of money we evaluate cash flows at the reporting unit level although the assumptions we use in our discounted cash flow model are consistent with the assumptions we use to generate our internal strategic plans and forecasts significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of future cash flows from each reporting unit and the relative risk of achieving those cash flows when using the market approach we make judgments about the comparability of publicly traded companies engaged in similar businesses we base our judgments on factors such as size growth rates profitability risk and return on investment we also make judgments when adjusting market multiples of revenue operating income and earnings for these companies to reflect their relative similarity to our own businesses see note 5 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report for a summary of goodwill by reportable segment 

we estimate the recoverability of acquired intangible assets and other longlived assets that have finite useful lives by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows that we expect the asset to generate in order to estimate the fair value of those assets we estimate the present value of future cash flows from those assets the key assumptions that we use in our discounted cash flow model are the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows to be generated by the asset over an extended period of time and a rate of return that considers the relative risk of achieving the cash flows and the time value of money significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of future cash flows and the relative risk of achieving those cash flows we also make judgments about the remaining useful lives of acquired intangible assets and other longlived assets that have finite lives see note 5 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report for a summary of cost accumulated amortization and weighted average life in years for our acquired intangible assets 

assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives are complex and often subjective they can be affected by a variety of factors including external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts for example if our future operating results do not meet current forecasts or if we experience a sustained decline in our market capitalization that is determined to be indicative of a reduction in fair value of one or more of our reporting units we may be required to record future impairment charges for goodwill and 



tables of contents 

acquired intangible assets impairment charges could materially decrease our future net income and result in lower asset values on our consolidated balance sheet 

during the fourth quarters of fiscal 2021 fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 we performed our annual goodwill impairment tests using the methodology described in “description of business and summary of significant accounting policies – goodwill acquired intangible assets and other longlived assets” in note 1 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report we determined that the estimated fair values of all of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values and that they were not impaired in addition during this analysis we concluded that the estimated fair values of all of our reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying values 

legal contingencies 

we are subject to certain legal proceedings as well as demands claims and threatened litigation that arise in the normal course of our business we review the status of each significant matter quarterly and assess our potential financial exposure if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated we record a liability and an expense for the estimated loss if we determine that a loss is possible and the range of the loss can be reasonably determined then we disclose the range of the possible loss significant judgment is required in the determination of whether a potential loss is probable reasonably possible or remote as well as in the determination of whether a potential exposure is reasonably estimable our accruals are based on the best information available at the time as additional information becomes available we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates potential legal liabilities and the revision of estimates of potential legal liabilities could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations see note 13 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report for more information 

accounting for income taxes – estimates of deferred taxes valuation allowances and uncertain tax positions 

we estimate our income taxes based on the various jurisdictions where we conduct business significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax rules and the potential for future adjustment of our uncertain tax positions by the united states internal revenue service or other taxing jurisdictions we estimate our current tax liability and assess temporary differences that result from differing treatments of certain items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which we show on our consolidated balance sheet we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized to the extent we believe that realization is not likely we establish a valuation allowance when we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in an accounting period we record a corresponding tax expense in our consolidated statement of operations 

we record a valuation allowance to reflect uncertainties about whether we will be able to utilize our deferred tax assets before they expire we assess the need for an adjustment to the valuation allowance on a quarterly basis the assessment is based on our estimates of future sources of taxable income in the jurisdictions in which we operate and the periods over which our deferred tax assets will be realizable while we have considered future taxable income in assessing the need for a valuation allowance for the periods presented we could in the future be required to increase the valuation allowance to take into account additional deferred tax assets that we may be unable to realize an increase in the valuation allowance could have an adverse impact on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which we record the change 

we recognize and measure benefits for uncertain tax positions using a twostep approach the first step is to evaluate the tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon audit including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes for tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely of being realized upon settlement significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions we evaluate our uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis our evaluations are based upon a number of factors including changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law correspondence with tax authorities during the course of audits and effective settlement of audit issues changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in material increases or decreases in our income tax expense in the period in which we make the change which could have a material impact on our effective tax rate and operating results see note 10 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report for more information

in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 we borrowed the full 1 billion under our unsecured revolving credit facility which we repaid in august 2020 the unsecured revolving credit facility is available to us for general corporate purposes in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 we also issued 2 billion in senior unsecured notes for general corporate purposes which was used to fund a portion of the acquisition of credit karma see “commitments for senior unsecured notes” later in this item 7 for more information 

based on past performance and current expectations we believe that our cash and cash equivalents investments and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet anticipated seasonal working capital needs capital expenditure requirements contractual obligations commitments debt service requirements and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations for at least the next 12 months we believe that our financial resources will allow us to manage any impact of covid19 on our business operations for the foreseeable future which could include potential reductions in revenue and delays in payments from customers and partners 

we expect to return excess cash generated by operations to our stockholders through payment of cash dividends after taking into account our operating and strategic cash needs 

our secured revolving credit facility is available to fund a portion of our loans to qualified small businesses at july 31 2021 48 million was outstanding under the secured revolving credit facility see “credit facilities” later in this item 7 for more information 

we evaluate on an ongoing basis the merits of acquiring technology or businesses or establishing strategic relationships with and investing in other companies our strong liquidity profile enables us to quickly respond to these kinds of opportunities

under the amended and restated credit agreement we may subject to certain customary conditions including lender approval on one or more occasions increase commitments under the unsecured revolving credit facility in an amount not to exceed 250 million in the aggregate and may extend the maturity date up to two times advances under the unsecured revolving credit facility accrue interest at rates that are equal to at our election either bank of americas alternate base rate plus a margin that ranges from 00 to 01 or the london interbank offered rate libor plus a margin that ranges from 069 to 11 actual margins under either election will be based on our senior debt credit ratings in may 2020 we borrowed the full 1 billion under the unsecured revolving credit facility and during the first quarter of fiscal 2021 we repaid the outstanding balance at july 31 2021 no amounts were outstanding under the unsecured revolving credit facility we currently believe that the credit facility will be available to us should we choose to borrow under it we monitor counterparty risk associated with the institutional lenders that are providing the credit facility 

on february 1 2021 we paid the 325 million remaining balance of the term loan upon maturity and at july 31 2021 no amount was outstandingthe term loan accrued interest at rates that are equal to at our election either bank of americas alternate base rate plus a margin that ranges from 00 to 0125 or libor plus a margin that ranges from 0625 to 1125 under this agreement we may subject to certain customary conditions including lender approval on one or more occasions increase commitments under the term loan in an amount not to exceed 400 million in the aggregate this option continues to be available to us through the maturity of the amended and restated credit agreement

libor to the secured overnight finance rate sofr plus related benchmark adjustments that represent the prevailing market convention for dollardenominated syndicated credit facilities the agreement includes certain affirmative and negative covenants including financial covenants that require the subsidiary to maintain specified financial ratios as of july 31 2021 we were compliant with all required covenants at july 31 2021 48 million was outstanding under this facility and the weightedaverage interest rate was 321 which includes the interest on the unused committed portion the outstanding balance is secured by cash and receivables of the subsidiary totaling 199 million 



our cash cash equivalents and investments totaled 39 billion at july 31 2021 approximately 8 of those funds were held by our foreign subsidiaries and subject to repatriation tax considerations these foreign funds were located primarily in canada the united kingdom and india as a result of the 2017 tax act we do not expect to pay incremental us taxes on repatriation we have recorded income tax expense for canada and india withholding taxes on earnings that are not permanently reinvested in the event that funds from foreign operations are repatriated to the united states we would pay withholding taxes at that time 



the following table summarizes our known contractual obligations to make future payments at july 31 2021

3 other longterm obligations on our consolidated balance sheet at july 31 2021 included longterm income tax liabilities of 24 million which related primarily to unrecognized tax benefits we have not included this amount in the table above because we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate regarding the timing of settlements with taxing authorities if any

 item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend

investment portfolio and interest rate risk 

we actively monitor market conditions and developments specific to the securities in which we invest we believe that we take a conservative approach to investing our funds in that we invest only in highlyrated securities and diversify our portfolio of investments while we believe we take prudent measures to mitigate investmentrelated risks such risks cannot be fully eliminated because of market circumstances that are outside our control 

our investments consist of instruments that meet quality standards that are consistent with our investment policy this policy specifies that except for direct obligations of the united states government securities issued by agencies of the united states government and money market funds we diversify our investments by limiting our holdings with any individual issuer we do not hold derivative financial instruments or european sovereign debt in our portfolio of investments see note 2 and note 3 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report for a summary of the amortized cost and fair value of our investments by type of issue 

our cash equivalents and investments are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates interest rate movements affect the interest income we earn on cash equivalents and investments and the value of those investments at july 31 2021 our cash equivalents and investments totaled 32 billion and had a weighted average pretax yield of 0356 total interest income for fiscal 2021 was 11 million if the federal reserve target rate had increased by 25 basis points from the level of july 31 2021 the value of our investments at that date would have decreased by approximately 5 million if the federal reserve target rate had increased by 100 basis points from the level of july 31 2021 the value of our investments at that date would have decreased by approximately 18 million 

we are also exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates as they affect our 1 billion unsecured revolving credit facility and 300 million secured revolving credit facility advances under the unsecured revolving credit facility accrue interest at rates that are equal to bank of america’s alternate base rate plus a margin that ranges from 00 to 01 or the london interbank offered rate libor plus a margin that ranges from 069 to 11 actual margins under are based on our senior debt credit ratings advances under the secured revolving credit facility accrue interest at a rate of libor plus 15 consequently our interest expense fluctuates with changes in the general level of these interest rates at july 31 2021 no amounts were outstanding under the unsecured revolving credit facility and 48 million was outstanding under the secured revolving credit facility see note 7 and note 8 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report for more information 

in june 2020 we issued 2 billion of senior unsecured notes which was comprised of the following 500 million of 0650 notes due in july 2023 500 million of 0950 notes due in july 2025 500 million of 1350 notes due in july 2027 and 500 million of 1650 notes due in july 2030 we carry these notes at face value less unamortized discount and unamortized debt issuance costs on our consolidated balance sheet since these notes bear interest at fixed rates we have no financial statement risk associated with changes in interest rates however the fair value of these notes fluctuates when interest rates change see note 2 and note 8 to the financial statements in item 8 of this report for more information 

impact of foreign currency rate changes 

the functional currencies of our international operating subsidiaries are generally the local currencies we translate the assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries at the exchange rates in effect on the balance sheet date we translate their revenue costs and expenses at the average rates of exchange in effect during the period we include translation gains and losses in the stockholders’ equity section of our consolidated balance sheets we include net gains and losses resulting from foreign exchange transactions in interest and other income in our consolidated statements of operations 

since we translate foreign currencies primarily canadian dollars indian rupees and british pounds into us dollars for financial reporting purposes currency fluctuations can have an impact on our financial results the historical impact of currency fluctuations on our financial results has generally been immaterial we believe that our exposure to currency exchange fluctuation risk is not significant because our global subsidiaries invoice customers and satisfy their financial obligations almost exclusively in their local currencies we believe the impact of currency fluctuations will continue to not be significant in the foreseeable future due to the reasons cited above as of july 31 2021 we did not engage in foreign currency hedging activities

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

based upon an evaluation of the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures intuit’s chief executive officer ceo and chief financial officer cfo have concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on form 10k our disclosure controls and procedures as defined under exchange act rules 13a15e and 15d15e were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our exchange act reports is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the securities and exchange commission and is accumulated and communicated to management including the ceo and cfo as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in exchange act rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of july 31 2021 based on the guidelines established in internal control – integrated frame work issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso 

in accordance with guidance issued by the securities and exchange commission companies are permitted to exclude acquisitions from their final assessment of internal control over financial reporting for the first fiscal year in which the acquisition occurred our management’s evaluation of internal control over financial reporting excluded the internal control activities of credit karma which we acquired on december 3 2020 as discussed in note 6 “business combinations” of the notes to the consolidated financial statements we have included the financial results of this acquisition in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition total revenue and net income subject to credit karma’s internal control over financial reporting represented nine percent of both our consolidated total revenues and net income for the fiscal year ended july 31 2021 total assets and net assets subject to credit karma’s internal control over financial reporting represent approximately nine percent of both our consolidated total assets and net assets excluding acquisition fair value adjustments as of july 31 2021 

based on the results of our evaluation our management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of july 31 2021 to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles we reviewed the results of management’s assessment with the audit and risk committee of intuit’s board of directors 

ernst  young llp an independent registered public accounting firm has audited the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of july 31 2021 their report is included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

except as noted above there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the period ended july 31 2021 that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls 

our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer believes that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and that they are effective at the reasonable assurance level however no matter how well conceived and executed a control system can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met the design of any control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs there are also limitations that are inherent in any control system these limitations include the realities that breakdowns can occur because of errors in judgment or mistakes and that controls can be circumvented by individual persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls because of these inherent limitations in a cost effective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected

that enable us to enhance or expand our offerings more rapidly we expect to expand our thirdparty technology relationships as we continue to pursue our growth strategy 

our online offerings and mobile applications have rapid development cycles while our traditional desktop software products tend to have predictable annual development and product release cycles in addition developing consumer and professional tax software and services presents unique challenges because of the demanding development cycle required to accurately incorporate federal and state tax law and tax form changes within a rigid timetable the development timing for our small business payroll and merchant payment processing services offerings varies with business needs and regulatory requirements and the length of the development cycle depends on the scope and complexity of each project 

we continue to make substantial investments in research and development and we expect to focus our future research and development efforts on enhancing existing products and services with financial recommendations personalization and ease of use enabled by ai and other advanced technologies we continue to focus on developing new products and services including new mobile and global offerings and significant research and development efforts for ongoing projects to update the technology platforms for several of our offerings 



historically our consumer and strategic partner offerings have had a significant and distinct seasonal pattern as sales and revenue from our income tax preparation products and services are heavily concentrated in the period from november through april this seasonal pattern has historically resulted in higher net revenues during our second and third quarters ending january 31 and april 30 respectively in march 2020 as a relief measure in response to the covid19 pandemic the irs extended the filing deadline for the 2019 tax year from april 15 2020 to july 15 2020 additionally all states with a personal income tax have also extended their due dates predominantly to july as a result we experienced a shift in sales and revenue from our third fiscal quarter to our fourth fiscal quarter during fiscal 2020 we expect the seasonality of our consumer and strategic partner businesses to continue to have a significant impact on our quarterly financial results in the future

overview 

we face intense competition in all of our businesses both domestically and internationally competitive interest and expertise in many of the markets we serve have grown markedly over the past few years and we expect this trend to continue some of our existing competitors have significantly greater financial technical and marketing resources than we do in addition the competitive landscape can shift rapidly as new companies enter and existing companies expand their businesses to include the markets in which we compete this is particularly true for online and mobile products and services where the barriers to entry are lower than they are for desktop software products and services to attract customers many online and mobile competitors are offering free or lowpriced products which we must take into account in our pricing strategies 

given the breadth of the products and services that we offer as a global technology company we compete with the offerings from a variety of companies across a range of industries our most obvious competition comes from other companies that currently offer technology solutions similar to ours in our small business  selfemployed segment we face competition from a variety of companies that provide products or services to address the problems that we help our customers to solve including getting paid faster paying their employees accessing capital and ensuring their books are done right our consumer segment competes with companies that offer products and services to help customers file their taxes better manage their money and reduce their debt we may also face competition from companies with platforms that could be developed to offer competing technology solutions to any of the problems that our customers may face such as facebook amazon and google in addition for many of our products and services other competitive alternatives for customers are thirdparty service providers such as professional accountants and seasonal tax preparation businesses manual tools and processes or generalpurpose software are also important competitive alternatives in some cases a competitor in one of our segments may be our partner in another one of our segments in other cases a company may compete with us in more than one of our segments 

competition specific to segments 

small business  selfemployed segment  quickbooks is the leading small business financial management software in the us small businesses often look to several companies to address their problems therefore our small business products and services face competitive challenges from a variety of companies that provide products or services that address one or more of their problems we compete to help small businesses get their books right with xero the sage group plc and freshbooks among others which offer software and associated services as well as online accounting offerings that directly serve small business customers for small businesses with more complex financial management needs our competitors include the sage group plc’s intacct offering and microsoft dynamics we also compete with free or lowcost online accounting offerings and free online banking and bill payment services offered by financial institutions and others in our payroll business we compete directly with automatic data processing inc adp paychex gusto and many other companies that help small businesses to pay their employees in our merchant services business we help our customers get paid faster and compete directly with large financial institutions such as wells fargo jp morgan chase and bank of america and with many payment processors including first data corporation elavon global payments fidelity national information services paypal and square our quickbooks capital offering which helps small businesses to access capital competes with a range of lending enterprises including large financial institutions such as the ones listed above fintech companies such as bluevine and kabbage and others 

consumer segment  in our consumer segment we compete to help our customers to file their taxes our future growth depends on our ability to attract new customers to the selfpreparation tax category and to our assisted offering turbotax live from tax stores and other tax preparers in the us private sector we face intense competition from hr block which provides tax preparation services in its stores and a competing software offering we also face competition from several other large tax preparation service providers from a myriad of small tax preparers and from numerous online selfpreparation offerings including free tax usa taxslayer blucora’s taxact and credit karma some of these competitors are offering electronic tax preparation and filing services at no cost to individual taxpayers in canada our turbotax canada offerings face competition from hr block simpletax studiotax and ufile among others these competing offerings subject us to significant price pressure in both the us and canada 



tables of contents 

we also face competitive challenges from government entities that offer publicly funded electronic tax preparation and filing services with no fees to individual taxpayers 

we are a member of the free file alliance a consortium of private sector companies that has entered into an agreement with the federal government under this agreement the member companies provide online federal tax preparation and filing services to eligible users at no cost to the government or individual users separate and apart from the member companies’ commercial free offerings which the irs then markets to consumers on an irs website approximately 22 states and the district of columbia have also adopted free file alliance publicprivate agreements additionally certain member companies including intuit provide online state tax preparation and filing services at no cost if the taxpayer qualified for the free federal return under this program we continue to actively work with others in the private and public sectors to advance the goals of the free file alliance policy initiative and to support successful publicprivate partnerships that reinforce the voluntary compliance tax system however future administrative regulatory or legislative activity in this area could seek to replace the voluntary compliance tax system with return preparation by government agencies which could harm our consumer business 

we also compete with numerous personal financial management companies such as credit karma nerdwallet and credit sesame and large financial institutions to help our customers better manage their money and reduce their debt 

strategic partner segment  in the us lacerte professional tax offerings face competition from competitivelypriced tax and accounting solutions that include integration with nontax functionality these include cch’s prosystems fx office suite and thomson reuters’ cs professional suite and gosystems tax our proseries professional tax offerings face competition from cch’s atx and taxwise offerings drake and other smaller providers in canada our profile professional tax offerings face competition from cch’s cantax and taxprep offerings taxcycle and thomson reuters’ dtmax and ufile pro offerings we also face growing competition from online tax and accounting offerings in the us and canada which may be marketed more effectively or have lower pricing than our offerings for accounting professionals 

competitive factors 

we believe the most important competitive factors for our core offerings – quickbooks turbotax lacerte and proseries – are ease of use product features size of the installed customer base brand name recognition value proposition cost reliability security and product and support quality access to distribution channels is also important for our quickbooks and turbotax desktop software products in addition support from accounting professionals and the ability for customers to upgrade within product families as their businesses grow are significant competitive factors for our quickbooks products productivity is an important competitive factor for the fullservice accounting firms to which we market our lacerte software products we believe we compete effectively on these factors as our quickbooks and turbotax products are the leading products in the us for their respective categories 

for our service offerings such as small business payroll and merchant payment processing we believe the most important competitive factors are functionality ease of use high availability security the integration of these products with related software brand name recognition effective distribution quality of support and cost

tables of contents 



our success depends on the proprietary technology embodied in our offerings we protect this proprietary technology by relying on a variety of intellectual property mechanisms including copyright patent trade secret and trademark laws restrictions on disclosure and other methods for example we regularly file applications for patents copyrights and trademarks and service marks in order to protect intellectual property that we believe is important to our business we hold a growing patent portfolio that we believe is important to intuit’s overall competitive advantage although we are not materially dependent on any one patent or particular group of patents in our portfolio at this time we also have a number of registered trademarks that include intuit quickbooks lacerte turbotax qb proseries proconnect and mint we have registered these and other trademarks and service marks in the united states and depending on the relevance of each brand to other markets in many foreign countries most registrations can be renewed perpetually at 10year intervals we also license intellectual property from third parties for use in our products 

although our portfolio of patents is growing the patents that have been issued to us could be determined to be invalid and may not be enforceable against competitive products in every jurisdiction in addition third parties have asserted and may in the future assert infringement claims against us and our customers these claims and any litigation may result in invalidation of our proprietary rights or a finding of infringement along with an assessment of damages litigation even if without merit could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention in addition thirdparty licenses may not continue to be available to us on commercially acceptable terms or at all

 item 1a  risk factors 

tableend

our businesses routinely encounter and address risks many of which could cause our future results to be materially different than we presently anticipate below we describe significant factors events and uncertainties that make an investment in our securities risky categorized solely for ease of reference as strategic operational legal and compliance and financial risks the following events and consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business growth prospects financial condition results of operations cash flows liquidity credit rating and reputation and the trading price of our common stock could decline these risks are not the only ones we face we could also be affected by other events factors or uncertainties that are presently unknown to us or that we do not currently consider to present significant risks to our business these risks may be amplified by the covid19 pandemic which has caused significant global economic instability and uncertainty the manner in which we respond to future developments as well as our competitors’ reactions to those developments may affect our future operating results 

the covid19 pandemic has caused significant economic instability and uncertainty and has had and may continue to have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

the covid19 pandemic has caused economic instability and uncertainty globally and has had a negative impact and may in the future have a material adverse impact on our business the covid19 pandemic has negatively impacted our small business results as a significant number of small businesses have closed or scaled back their offerings particularly in light of shelterinplace and similar directives the severity and duration of the pandemics impact on our operational and financial performance are uncertain and will depend on many factors beyond our control potential and current negative impacts of the pandemic include but are not limited to the following 

 these and other potential negative impacts relating to the covid19 pandemic are described further in the risk factors that follow 



tables of contents 

strategic risks 

strategic risks relate to our current and future operating model business plans and growth strategy including the risks associated with the following competitive pressures on our product offerings and business models our ability to adapt to technological changes and global trends our reliance on thirdparty intellectual property and our ability to protect our own intellectual property rights the value of our brand and mergers acquisitions and divestiture activity that may have unanticipated costs and expenses 

we face intense competitive pressures that may harm our operating results 

we face intense competition in all of our businesses and we expect competition to remain intense in the future our competitors and potential competitors range from large and established entities to emerging startups our competitors may introduce superior products and services reduce prices have greater technical marketing and other resources have greater name recognition have larger installed bases of customers have wellestablished relationships with our current and potential customers advertise aggressively or beat us to market with new products and services in addition we face competition from existing companies with large established consumer userbases and broadbased platforms who may change or expand the focus of their business strategies and marketing to target our customers including small businesses and tax customers 

we also face competition from companies with a variety of business models including increased competition from providers of free offerings particularly in our tax accounting and payments businesses in order to compete we have also introduced free offerings in several categories but we may not be able to attract customers as effectively as competitors with different business models in addition other providers of free offerings may provide features that we do not offer and customers who have formerly paid for intuit’s products and services may elect to use our competitors’ free offerings instead these competitive factors may diminish our revenue and profitability and harm our ability to acquire and retain customers 

our consumer tax business also faces significant potential competition from the public sector where we face the risk of federal and state taxing authorities proposing revenue raising strategies that involve developing and providing government tax software or other government return preparation systems at public expense these or similar programs may be introduced or expanded in the future which may change the voluntary compliance tax system in ways that could cause us to lose customers and revenue the irs free file program is currently the sole means by which the irs offers tax software to taxpayers and in december 2019 the agreement governing the program was amended to eliminate the pledge by the irs that it will not offer a duplicative or competing service under this program the irs has worked with private industry to provide more than 56 million free returns since 2003 utilizing donated private sector tax software and efiling services for low and middle income taxpayers at no cost to the government or individual users however its continuation depends on a number of factors including increasing public awareness of and access to the free program as well as continued government support the current agreement is scheduled to expire in october 2021 recently we have become the subject of certain legal proceedings and regulatory inquiries relating to the provision and marketing of the product that we offer under the irs free file program while we believe that the allegations in these proceedings are without merit the proceedings may decrease the government’s support of such program and increase the likelihood that such program is terminated if the free file program were to be terminated or the irs were to enter the software development and return preparation space the federal government could become a publicly funded direct competitor of the us tax services industry and of intuit government funded services that curtail or eliminate the role of taxpayers in preparing their own taxes could potentially have material and adverse revenue implications 

future revenue growth depends upon our ability to adapt to technological change as well as global trends in the way customers access software offerings and successfully introduce new and enhanced products services and business models 

we operate in industries that are characterized by rapidly changing technology evolving industry standards and frequent new product introductions we must continue to innovate and develop new products and features to meet changing customer needs and attract and retain talented software developers we need to continue to develop our skills tools and capabilities to capitalize on existing and emerging technologies which requires us to devote significant resources 

our consumer and professional tax businesses depend significantly on revenue from customers who return each year to use our updated tax preparation and filing software and services as our existing products mature encouraging customers to purchase product upgrades becomes more challenging unless new product releases provide features and functionality that have meaningful incremental value we also provide additional customer benefits by utilizing customer data available to us through our existing offerings if we are not able to develop and clearly demonstrate the value of new or upgraded products or services to our customers or effectively utilize our customers’ data to provide them with value our revenues may be harmed in addition as we continue to introduce and expand our new business models including offerings that are free to end users our customers may not perceive value in the additional benefits and services we offer beyond our free offering and may choose not to pay for those additional benefits or we may be unsuccessful in increasing customer adoption of these offerings or our risk profile may change resulting in loss of revenue 

we have devoted significant resources to develop products and services for users of mobile devices but the versions of our products and services developed for these devices may not be compelling to users even if we are able to attract new users through these mobile offerings the amount of revenue that we derive per user from mobile offerings may be less than the revenue that we have historically derived from users of personal computers as new devices and new platforms are continually 



tables of contents 

being released it is difficult to predict the problems we may encounter in developing versions of our products and services for use on mobile devices and we may need to devote significant resources to the creation support and maintenance of such offerings if we are slow to develop products and technologies that are compatible with mobile devices or if our competitors are able to achieve those results more quickly than us we will fail to capture a significant share of an increasingly important portion of the market for online services which could adversely affect our business further legislation or regulatory changes may mandate changes in our products that make them less attractive to users 

in some cases we may expend a significant amount of resources and management attention on offerings that do not ultimately succeed in their markets we have encountered difficulty in launching new products and services in the past if we misjudge customer needs in the future our new products and services may not succeed and our revenues and earnings may be harmed we have also invested and in the future expect to invest in new business models geographies strategies and initiatives such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties including distraction of management from current operations expenses associated with the initiatives and inadequate return on investments because these new initiatives are inherently risky they may not be successful and may harm our financial condition and operating results 

we rely on thirdparty intellectual property in our products and services 

many of our products and services include intellectual property of third parties which we license under agreements that may need to be renewed or renegotiated from time to time we may not be able to obtain licenses to these thirdparty technologies or content on reasonable terms or at all if we are unable to obtain the rights necessary to use this intellectual property in our products and services we may not be able to sell the affected offerings and customers who are currently using the affected product may be disrupted which may in turn harm our future financial results damage our brand and result in customer loss also we and our customers have been and may continue to be subject to infringement claims as a result of the thirdparty intellectual property incorporated in our offerings although we try to mitigate this risk and we may not be ultimately liable for any potential infringement pending claims require us to use significant resources require management attention and could result in loss of customers 

some of our offerings include thirdparty software that is licensed under socalled “open source” licenses some of which may include a requirement that under certain circumstances we make available or grant licenses to any modifications or derivative works we create based upon the open source software although we have established internal review and approval processes to mitigate these risks we cannot be sure that all open source software is submitted for approval prior to use in our products many of the risks associated with usage of open source may not be eliminated and may if not properly addressed harm our business 

our intellectual property rights are valuable and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products services and brand 

our patents trademarks trade secrets copyrights domain names and other intellectual property rights are important assets for us we aggressively protect our intellectual property rights by relying on federal state and common law rights in the us and internationally as well as a variety of administrative procedures we also rely on contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary rights in products and services the efforts that we take to protect our proprietary rights may not always be sufficient or effective protecting our intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming and may not be successful in every location any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business our brand and our ability to compete 

policing unauthorized use and copying of our products is difficult expensive and time consuming current us laws that prohibit copying give us only limited practical protection from software piracy and the laws of many other countries provide very little protection we frequently encounter unauthorized copies of our software being sold through online marketplaces although we continue to evaluate and put in place technology solutions to attempt to lessen the impact of piracy and engage in efforts to educate consumers and public policy leaders on these issues and cooperate with industry groups in their efforts to combat piracy we expect piracy to be a persistent problem that results in lost revenues and increased expenses 

our business depends on our strong reputation and the value of our brands 

developing and maintaining awareness of our brands is critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our existing and future products and services and is an important element in attracting new customers adverse publicity whether or not justified relating to events or activities attributed to us members of our workforce agents third parties we rely on or our users may tarnish our reputation and reduce the value of our brands our brand value also depends on our ability to provide secure and trustworthy products and services as well as our ability to protect and use our customers’ data in a manner that meets their expectations in addition a security incident which results in unauthorized disclosure of our customers’ sensitive data could cause material reputational harm damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity may reduce demand for our products and services and thus have an adverse effect on our future financial results as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of the brands and could also reduce our stock price

our acquisition and divestiture activities may disrupt our ongoing business may involve increased expenses and may present risks not contemplated at the time of the transactions 

we have acquired and may continue to acquire companies products technologies and talent that complement our strategic direction both in and outside the united states acquisitions including our pending acquisition of credit karma the transaction involve significant risks and uncertainties including 

 we have divested and may in the future divest certain assets or businesses that no longer fit with our strategic direction or growth targets divestitures involve significant risks and uncertainties including 

 in addition any acquisition or divestiture that we announce may not be completed if closing conditions are not satisfied because acquisitions and divestitures are inherently risky our transactions may not be successful and may in some cases harm our operating results or financial condition in particular the completion of the transaction is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of a number of conditions as set forth in the related merger agreement including among others the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods pursuant to the hartscottrodino act and no applicable law having been enacted that prohibits the consummation of the transaction there can be no assurance that the parties will be able to satisfy the closing conditions or that closing conditions beyond our or credit karma’s control will be satisfied or waived if the transaction and the integration of the companies’ respective businesses are not completed within the expected time frame such delay may materially and adversely affect the synergies and other benefits that we and credit karma expect to achieve as a result of the transaction and could result in additional transaction costs loss of revenue or other effects associated with uncertainty about the transaction moreover the impact of covid19 adverse changes in market conditions additional transaction and integrationrelated costs and other factors that may be exacerbated by the impact of covid19 such as the failure to realize some or all of the anticipated benefits of the transaction may cause the transaction to be dilutive to intuit’s

operational risks 

operational risks arise from internal and external events relating to systems processes and people risks that affect the operation of our businesses include the following potential security incidents privacy and cybersecurity concerns relating to online offerings fraudulent activities by third parties relationships with third parties competition for and retention of key talent issues with our product launches problems with our information technology infrastructure and risks associated with operating internationally 

security incidents improper access to or disclosure of our data or customers’ data or other cyberattacks on our systems could harm our reputation and adversely affect our business 

we host collect use and retain large amounts of sensitive and personal customer and workforce data including credit card information tax return information bank account numbers login credentials and passwords personal and business financial data and transactions data social security numbers and payroll information as well as our confidential nonpublic business information we use commercially available security technologies and security and business controls to limit access to and use of such sensitive data although we expend significant resources to create security protections designed to shield this data against potential theft and security breaches such measures cannot provide absolute security 

our technologies systems and networks have been subject to and are likely to continue to be the target of cyberattacks computer viruses worms social engineering malicious software programs insider threats and other cybersecurity incidents that could result in the unauthorized release gathering monitoring use loss or destruction of sensitive and personal data of our customers and members of our workforce or intuits sensitive business data or cause temporary or sustained unavailability of our software and systems these types of incidents can be made by individuals groups of hackers and sophisticated organizations including statesponsored organizations or nationstates themselves customers who fail to update their systems continue to run software that we no longer support or that fail to install security patches on a timely basis create vulnerabilities and make it more difficult for us to detect and prevent these kinds of attacks we are increasingly incorporating open source software into our products there may be vulnerabilities in open source software that make it susceptible to cyberattacks in addition because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to sensitive information change frequently and are becoming more sophisticated and are often not able to be detected until after a successful attack we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventive measures although this is an industrywide problem that affects software and hardware across platforms it may increasingly affect our offerings because cybercriminals tend to focus their efforts on wellknown offerings that are popular among customers and hold sensitive information and we expect them to continue to do so 

further the security measures that we implement may not be able to prevent unauthorized access to our products and our customers’ account data third parties may fraudulently induce members of our workforce customers or users by social engineering means such as email phishing to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our systems it is also possible that unauthorized access to or disclosure of customer data may occur due to inadequate use of security controls by our customers or members of our workforce accounts created with weak or recycled passwords could allow cyberattackers to gain access to customer data unauthorized persons could gain access to customer accounts if customers do not maintain effective access controls of their systems and software in addition we are experiencing new and more frequent attempts by third parties to use the covid19 pandemic to fraudulently gain access to our systems such as through increased email phishing of our workforce 

criminals may also use stolen identity information obtained outside of our systems to gain unauthorized access to our customers’ data we have experienced such instances in the past and as the accessibility of stolen identity information increases generally we may experience further instances of unauthorized access to our systems through the use of stolen identity information of our customers or members of our workforce in the future further our customers may choose to use the same user id and password across multiple products and services unrelated to our products such customers’ login credentials may be stolen from products offered by thirdparty service providers unrelated to us and the stolen identity information may be used by a malicious third party to access our products which could result in disclosure of confidential information in addition in response to the covid19 pandemic we have temporarily shifted nearly all our workforce from office locations to work from home environments which increases our exposure to securityrelated risks due to operational changes such as the increased use of videoconferencing 

our efforts to protect data may also be unsuccessful due to software bugs whether open source or proprietary code breakins workforce member error or other threats that evolve 

further because we have created an ecosystem where customers can have one identity across multiple intuit products a security incident may give access to increased amounts of customer data this may result in disclosure of confidential information loss of customer confidence in our products possible litigation material harm to our reputation and financial condition disruption of our or our customers’ business operations and a decline in our stock price from time to time we detect or receive notices from customers or public or private agencies that they have detected actual or perceived vulnerabilities in our servers our software or thirdparty software components that are distributed with our products or fraudulent activity by unauthorized persons utilizing our products with stolen customer identity information the existence of 



tables of contents 

such vulnerabilities or fraudulent activity even if they do not result in a security breach may undermine customer confidence as well as the confidence of government agencies that regulate our offerings such perceived vulnerabilities could also seriously harm our business by tarnishing our reputation and brand andor limiting the adoption of our products and services and could cause our stock price to decline 

a cybersecurity incident affecting the third parties we rely on could expose us or our customers to a risk of loss or misuse of confidential information and significantly damage our reputation 

we depend on a number of third parties including vendors developers and partners who are critical to our business we or our customers may grant access to customer data to these third parties to help deliver customer benefits or to host certain of our and our customers sensitive and personal data in addition we share sensitive nonpublic business information including for example materials relating to financial business and legal strategies with other vendors in the ordinary course of business 

while we conduct background checks of our workforce conduct reviews of partners developers and vendors and use commercially available technologies to limit access to systems and data it is possible that one or more of these individuals or third parties may misrepresent their intended use of data or may circumvent our controls resulting in accidental or intentional disclosure or misuse of our customers’ or employees’ data further while we conduct due diligence on these third parties with respect to their security and business controls we may not have the ability to effectively monitor or oversee the implementation of these control measures individuals or third parties may be able to circumvent these security and business controls andor exploit vulnerabilities that may exist in these controls resulting in the disclosure or misuse of sensitive business and personal customer or employee information and data 

a security incident involving third parties whom we rely on may have serious negative consequences for our businesses including disclosure of sensitive customer or employee data or confidential or competitively sensitive information regarding our business including intellectual property and other proprietary data make our products more vulnerable to fraudulent activity cause temporary or sustained unavailability of our software and systems result in possible litigation fines penalties and damages result in loss of customer confidence cause material harm to our reputation and brands lead to further regulation and oversight by federal or state agencies cause adverse financial condition and result in a reduced stock price 

concerns about the current privacy and cybersecurity environment generally could deter current and potential customers from adopting our products and services and damage our reputation 

the continued occurrence of cyberattacks and data breaches on governments businesses and consumers in general indicates that we operate in an external environment where cyberattacks and data breaches are becoming increasingly common if the global cybersecurity environment worsens and there are increased instances of security breaches of thirdparty offerings where consumers’ data and sensitive information is compromised consumers may be less willing to use online offerings particularly offerings like ours in which customers often share sensitive financial data in addition the increased availability of data obtained as a result of breaches of thirdparty offerings could make our own products more vulnerable to fraudulent activity even if our products are not affected directly by such incidents any such incident could damage our reputation and deter current and potential customers from adopting our products and services or lead customers to cease using online and connected software products to transact financial business altogether 

if we are unable to effectively combat the increasing amount and sophistication of fraudulent activities by third parties using our offerings we may suffer losses which may be substantial and lose the confidence of our customers and government agencies and our revenues and earnings may be harmed 

the online tax preparation payroll administration online payments and lending industries have been experiencing an increasing amount of fraudulent activities by third parties and those fraudulent activities are becoming increasingly sophisticated although we do not believe that any of this activity is uniquely targeted at our products or business this type of fraudulent activity may adversely impact our tax payroll and payments and lending businesses and is heightened while we are responding to the covid19 pandemic with measures such as requiring nearly all of our workforce to work from home in addition to any losses that may result from such fraud which may be substantial a loss of confidence by our customers or by governmental agencies in our ability to prevent fraudulent activity that is perpetrated through our offerings may seriously harm our business and damage our brand if we cannot adequately combat such fraudulent activity that is perpetrated through our tax and lending offerings governmental authorities may refuse to allow us to continue to offer such services or these services may otherwise be adversely impacted which could include federal or state tax authorities refusing to allow us to process our customers’ tax returns electronically resulting in a significant adverse impact on our earnings and revenue as fraudulent activities become more pervasive and increasingly sophisticated and fraud detection and prevention measures must become correspondingly more complex to combat them across the various industries in which we operate we may implement risk control mechanisms that could make it more difficult for legitimate customers to obtain and use our products which could result in lost revenue and negatively impact our earnings 

if we fail to process transactions effectively or fail to adequately protect against disputed or potential fraudulent activities our business may be harmed 

our operations process a significant volume and dollar value of transactions on a daily basis especially in our payroll and 



tables of contents 

payments businesses despite our efforts to ensure that effective processing systems and controls are in place to handle transactions appropriately it is possible that we may make errors or that funds may be misappropriated due to fraud the likelihood of any such error or misappropriation may increase as we accelerate the speed at which we process transactions the systems supporting our business are comprised of multiple technology platforms that are sometimes difficult to scale if we are unable to effectively manage our systems and processes or if there is an error in our products we may be unable to process customer data in an accurate reliable and timely manner which may harm our reputation the willingness of customers to use our products and our financial results in our payments processing service business if merchants for whom we process payment transactions are unable to pay refunds due to their customers in connection with disputed or fraudulent merchant transactions we may be required to pay those amounts and our payments may exceed the amount of the customer reserves we have established to make such payments 

business interruption or failure of our information technology and communication systems may impair the availability of our products and services which may damage our reputation and harm our future financial results 

our reputation and ability to attract retain and serve our customers is dependent upon the reliable performance of our products and our underlying technical infrastructure as we continue to grow our online services we become more dependent on the continuing operation and availability of our information technology and communications systems and those of our external service providers including for example thirdparty internetbased or cloud computing services we do not have redundancy for all of our systems and our disaster recovery planning may not account for all eventualities we have designed a significant portion of our software and computer systems to utilize data processing and storage capabilities provided by public cloud providers such as amazon web services if any public cloud service that we use is unavailable to us for any reason our customers may not be able to access certain of our cloud products or features which could significantly impact our operations business and financial results 

failure of our systems or those of our thirdparty service providers may result in interruptions in our service and loss of data or processing capabilities all of which may cause a loss in customers refunds of product fees material harm to our reputation and operating results 

our tax businesses must effectively handle extremely heavy customer demand during critical peak periodswhich typically occur from january until april of each year in response to the covid19 pandemic the irs extended the filing deadline for tax year 2019 until july 15 2020 and all states with personal income tax also extended their due dates predominantly to july and we experienced heavy customer demand during the extended filing period we face significant risks in maintaining adequate service levels during these peak periods when we derive a substantial portion of our overall revenue from the tax businesses any interruptions in our online tax preparation or electronic filing service at any time during the tax season particularly during a peak period could result in significantly decreased revenue lost customers unexpected refunds of customer charges negative publicity and increased operating costs any of which could significantly harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

we rely on internal systems and external systems maintained by manufacturers distributors and other service providers to take and fulfill customer orders handle customer service requests and host certain online activities any interruption or failure of our internal or external systems may prevent us or our service providers from accepting and fulfilling customer orders or cause company and customer data to be unintentionally disclosed our continuing efforts to upgrade and expand our network security and other information systems as well as our highavailability capabilities are costly and problems with the design or implementation of system enhancements may harm our business and our results of operations 

our business operations data centers information technology and communications systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters human error malicious attacks fire power loss telecommunications failures computer viruses computer denial of service attacks terrorist attacks health emergencies such as the covid19 pandemic and other events beyond our control for example our employees are largely concentrated in california and india each of which have been affected by the covid19 pandemic and subject to governmental actions designed to contain the spread of covid19 such as limitations on the size of gatherings closures of work facilities schools public buildings and businesses quarantines lockdowns and travel restrictions the closure of our facilities in those and other areas in which we operate and other restrictions inhibiting our employees’ ability to access our facilities have disrupted and could continue to disrupt our business operations we have also modified our business practices in connection with the pandemic including employee travel employee work locations and cancellation of physical participation in meetings events and conferences and we may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees customers or thirdparty partners there is no certainty that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the virus and that such measures will not impair our ability to perform critical functions any such measures could make it considerably more difficult to develop enhance and support our products and services 

we cannot predict how long any such measures will be in place and whether we would reimplement or enhance any such measures in one or more locations in order to respond to the effects of the pandemic or the rules regulations or guidelines of any governmental authority moreover the complexity of resuming operations in our offices could introduce new execution risks and we may experience longerterm disruptions to our operations such as shifts in the work location preferences of our workforce for personal health and safety reasons 



tables of contents 

in addition our corporate headquarters and other critical business operations are located near major seismic faults in the event of a major natural or manmade disaster our insurance coverage may not completely compensate us for our losses and our future financial results may be materially harmed 

we regularly invest resources to update and improve our internal information technology systems and software platforms should our investments not succeed or if delays or other issues with new or existing internal technology systems and software platforms disrupt our operations our business could be harmed 

we rely on our network and data center infrastructure and internal technology systems for many of our development marketing operational support sales accounting and financial reporting activities we are continually investing resources to update and improve these systems and environments in order to meet existing needs as well as the growing and changing requirements of our business and customers if we experience prolonged delays or unforeseen difficulties in updating and upgrading our systems and architecture we may experience outages and may not be able to deliver certain offerings and develop new offerings and enhancements that we need to remain competitive such improvements and upgrades are often complex costly and time consuming in addition such improvements can be challenging to integrate with our existing technology systems or may uncover problems with our existing technology systems unsuccessful implementation of hardware or software updates and improvements could result in outages disruption in our business operations loss of revenue or damage to our reputation 

if we are unable to develop manage and maintain critical thirdparty business relationships our business may be adversely affected 

our growth is increasingly dependent on the strength of our business relationships and our ability to continue to develop manage and maintain new and existing relationships with thirdparty partners we rely on various thirdparty partners including software and service providers suppliers vendors manufacturers distributors accountants contractors financial institutions core processors licensing partners and development partners among others in many areas of our business in order to deliver our offerings and operate our business we also rely on third parties to support the operation of our business by maintaining our physical facilities equipment power systems and infrastructure in certain instances these thirdparty relationships are sole source or limited source relationships and can be difficult to replace or substitute depending on the level of integration of the third party’s products or services into or with our offerings andor the general availability of such third party’s products and services in addition there may be few or no alternative thirdparty providers or vendors in the market further there can be no assurance that we will be able to adequately retain thirdparty contractors engaged to help us operate our business 

additionally the business operations of our thirdparty partners have been and could continue to be disrupted by the covid19 pandemic and the actions taken in response to it including the pandemic’s effects on their thirdparty partners if our thirdparty partners are unable to help us operate our business as a result of the covid19 pandemic our business and financial results may be negatively impacted the failure of third parties to provide acceptable and high quality products services and technologies or to update their products services and technologies may result in a disruption to our business operations and our customers which may reduce our revenues and profits cause us to lose customers and damage our reputation alternative arrangements and services may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all or we may experience business interruptions upon a transition to an alternative partner 

although we have strict standards for our suppliers and business partners to comply with the law and company policies regarding workplace and employment practices data use and security environmental compliance intellectual property licensing and other applicable regulatory and compliance requirements we cannot control their daytoday practices any violation of laws or implementation of practices regarded as unethical could result in supply chain disruptions canceled orders terminations of or damage to key relationships and damage to our reputation 

in particular we have relationships with banks credit unions and other financial institutions that support certain critical services we offer to our customers if macroeconomic conditions or other factors including the effects of the covid19 pandemic cause any of these institutions to fail consolidate stop providing certain services or institute costcutting efforts our business and financial results may suffer and we may be unable to offer those services to our customers 

we increasingly utilize the distribution platforms of third parties like apple’s app store and google’s play store for the distribution of certain of our product offerings although we benefit from the strong brand recognition and large user base of these distribution platforms to attract new customers the platform owners have wide discretion to change the pricing structure terms of service and other policies with respect to us and other developers any adverse changes by these third parties could adversely affect our financial results 

because competition for our key employees is intense we may not be able to attract retain and develop the highly skilled employees we need to support our planned growth 

much of our future success depends on the continued service and availability of skilled personnel including members of our executive team and those in technical and other key positions experienced personnel in the software mobile technologies data science data security and software as a service industries are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense especially in california and india where the majority of our employees are located also as we strive to continue to adapt to 



tables of contents 

technological change and introduce new and enhanced products and business models we must be able to secure maintain and develop the right quality and quantity of engaged and committed talent the incentives we have available to attract retain and motivate employees provided by our equity awards may become less effective and if we were to issue significant equity to attract additional employees the ownership of our existing stockholders would be diluted although we strive to be an employer of choice we may not be able to continue to successfully attract retain and develop key personnel which may cause our business to suffer 

if we experience significant product accuracy or quality problems or delays in product launches it may harm our revenue earnings and reputation 

all of our tax products and many of our nontax products have rigid development timetables that increase the risk of errors in our products and the risk of launch delays our tax preparation software product development cycle is particularly challenging due to the need to incorporate unpredictable and potentially late tax law and tax form changes each year and because our customers expect high levels of accuracy and a timely launch of these products to prepare and file their taxes by the tax filing deadline due to the complexity of our products and the condensed development cycles under which we operate our products may contain errors that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the software or result in incorrect calculations the complexity of the tax laws on which our products are based may also make it difficult for us to consistently deliver offerings that contain the features functionality and level of accuracy that our customers expect when we encounter problems we may be required to modify our code work with state tax administrators to communicate with affected customers assist customers with amendments distribute patches to customers who have already purchased the product and recall or repackage existing product inventory in our distribution channels if we encounter development challenges or discover errors in our products either late in our development cycle or after release it may cause us to delay our product launch date or suspend product availability until such issues can be fixed any major defects launch delays or product suspensions may lead to loss of customers and revenue negative publicity customer and employee dissatisfaction reduced retailer shelf space and promotions and increased operating expenses such as inventory replacement costs legal fees or other payments including those resulting from our accuracy guarantee in our tax preparation products for example an error in our tax products could cause a compliance error for taxpayers including the over or underpayment of their federal or state tax liability while our accuracy guarantee commits us to reimburse penalties and interest paid by customers due solely to calculation errors in our tax preparation products such errors may result in additional burdens on third parties that we may need to address or that may cause us to suspend the availability of our products until such errors are addressed this could also affect our reputation the willingness of customers to use our products and our financial results further as we develop our platform to connect people to experts such as connecting turbotax customers with tax experts through our turbotax live offering or connecting quickbooks customers with bookkeepers through our quickbooks live offering we face the risk that these experts may provide advice that is erroneous ineffective or otherwise unsuitable any such deficiency in the advice given by these experts may cause harm to our customers a loss of customer confidence in our offerings or harm to our reputation or financial results 

our international operations are subject to increased risks which may harm our business operating results and financial condition 

in addition to uncertainty about our ability to generate revenues from our foreign operations and expand into international markets there are risks inherent in doing business internationally including 





tables of contents 

 violations of the rapidly evolving and complex foreign and us laws and regulations that apply to our international operations may result in fines criminal actions or sanctions against us our officers or our employees prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with these laws we cannot be sure that our employees contractors and agents are in compliance with our policies these risks inherent in our international operations and expansion increase our costs of doing business internationally and may result in harm to our business operating results and financial condition 

legal and compliance risks 

legal and compliance risks arise from change in the government and regulatory environment including complex and evolving regulations relating privacy and data security potential litigation regulatory inquiries and intellectual property infringement claims 

increased government regulation of our businesses or changes to existing regulations may harm our operating results 

the company is subject to federal state local and international laws and regulations that affect the company’s activities including without limitation areas of labor advertising tax financial services data privacy and security electronic funds transfer money transmission lending digital content consumer protection real estate billing ecommerce promotions quality of services intellectual property ownership and infringement import and export requirements anticorruption foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions anticompetition environmental health and safety and other regulated activities there have been significant new regulations and heightened focus by the government on many of these areas as well as in areas such as insurance and privacy as we expand our products and services and revise our business models both domestically and internationally we may become subject to additional government regulation or increased regulatory scrutiny for example in april 2020 one of our subsidiaries became a small business administration sba approved lender under the sba’s recently established paycheck protection program “ppp” authorized by the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act further regulators both in the us and in other jurisdictions in which we operate may adopt new laws or regulations change existing regulations or their interpretation of existing laws or regulations may differ from ours in response to the covid19 pandemic federal state local and foreign governmental authorities have imposed and may continue to impose protocols and restrictions intended to contain the spread of the virus including limitations on the size of gatherings closures of work facilities schools public buildings and businesses quarantines lockdowns and travel restrictions such restrictions have disrupted and may continue to disrupt our business operations and limit our ability to perform critical functions 

the tax preparation industry continues to receive heightened attention from federal and state governments new legislation regulation public policy considerations changes in the cybersecurity environment litigation by the government or private entities changes to or new interpretations of existing laws may result in greater oversight of the tax preparation industry restrict the types of products and services that we can offer or the prices we can charge or otherwise cause us to change the way we operate our tax businesses or offer our tax products and services we may not be able to respond quickly to such regulatory legislative and other developments and these changes may in turn increase our cost of doing business and limit our revenue opportunities in addition if our practices are not consistent with new interpretations of existing laws we may become subject to lawsuits penalties and other liabilities that did not previously apply we are also required to comply with a variety of state revenue agency standards in order to successfully operate our tax preparation and electronic filing services 

changes in stateimposed requirements by one or more of the states including the required use of specific technologies or technology standards may significantly increase the costs of providing those services to our customers and may prevent us from delivering a quality product to our customers in a timely manner 

complex and evolving us and international laws and regulation regarding privacy and data protection could result in claims changes to our business practices penalties or increased cost of operations or otherwise harm our business 

regulations related to the provision of online services is evolving as federal state and foreign governments continue to adopt new or modify existing laws and regulations addressing data privacy and the collection processing storage transfer and use of data this includes for example the eus general data protection regulation gdpr and the new california consumer protection act ccpa which became effective on january 1 2020 in our efforts to meet the gdpr ccpa and other data privacy regulations we have made and continue to make certain operational changes to our products and business practices if we are unable to engineer products that meet these evolving requirements or help our customers meet their obligations under these or other new data regulations we might experience reduced demand for our offerings further penalties for noncompliance with these laws may be significant 

in addition there are global privacy treaties and frameworks that have created compliance uncertainty and increased complexity for example the european commission and the swiss government approved the euus and swissus privacy 



tables of contents 

shield frameworks respectively that provide a mechanism for companies to legally transfer personal data from the eu and switzerland to the us however these frameworks as well as other personal data transfer mechanisms face a number of legal challenges both by regulators and private parties a change in these transfer mechanisms could cause us to incur costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business 

other governmental authorities throughout the us and around the world are considering similar types of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection each of these privacy security and data protection laws and regulations could impose significant limitations require changes to our business require notification to customers or workers of a security breach restrict our use or storage of personal information or cause changes in customer purchasing behavior which may make our business more costly less efficient or impossible to conduct and may require us to modify our current or future products or services which may make customers less likely to purchase our products and may harm our future financial results additionally any actual or alleged noncompliance with these laws and regulations could result in negative publicity and subject us to investigations claims or other remedies including demands that we modify or cease existing business practices and expose us to significant fines penalties and other damages we have incurred and may continue to incur significant expenses to comply with existing privacy and security standards and protocols imposed by law regulation industry standards or contractual obligations 

we are frequently a party to litigation and regulatory inquiries which could result in an unfavorable outcome and have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operation and cash flows 

we are subject to various legal proceedings including class action lawsuits claims and regulatory inquiries that have arisen out of the ordinary conduct of our business and are not yet resolved and additional claims and inquiries may arise in the future the number and significance of these claims and inquiries may increase as our businesses evolve any proceedings claims or inquiries initiated by or against us whether successful or not may be time consuming result in costly litigation damage awards consent decrees injunctive relief or increased costs of business require us to change our business practices or products require significant amounts of management time result in diversion of significant operations resources or otherwise harm our business and future financial results for further information about specific litigation see item 3 “legal proceedings” 

third parties claiming that we infringe their proprietary rights may cause us to incur significant legal expenses and prevent us from selling our products 

we may become increasingly subject to infringement claims including patent copyright trade secret and trademark infringement claims litigation may be necessary to determine the validity and scope of the intellectual property rights of others we have received a number of allegations of intellectual property infringement claims in the past and expect to receive more claims in the future based on allegations that our offerings infringe upon the intellectual property held by third parties some of these claims are the subject of pending litigation against us and against some of our customers these claims may involve patent holding companies or other adverse intellectual property owners who have no relevant product revenues of their own and against whom our own intellectual property may provide little or no deterrence the ultimate outcome of any allegation is uncertain and regardless of outcome any such claim with or without merit may be time consuming to defend result in costly litigation divert management’s time and attention from our business require us to stop selling delay shipping or redesign our products or require us to pay monetary damages for royalty or licensing fees or to satisfy indemnification obligations that we have with some of our customers our failure to obtain necessary license or other rights or litigation arising out of intellectual property claims may harm our business 

we are subject to risks associated with information disseminated through our services 

the laws relating to the liability of online services companies for information such as online content disseminated through their services are subject to frequent challenges in spite of settled law in the us claims are made against online services companies by parties who disagree with the content where our online content is accessed on the internet outside of the us challenges may be brought under foreign laws which do not provide the same protections for online services companies as in the us these challenges in either us or foreign jurisdictions may give rise to legal claims alleging defamation libel invasion of privacy negligence copyright or trademark infringement or other theories based on the nature and content of the materials disseminated through the services certain of our services include content generated by users of our online services although this content is not generated by us claims of defamation or other injury may be made against us for that content any costs incurred as a result of this potential liability may harm our business 

financial risks 

financial risks relate to our ability to meet financial obligations and mitigate exposure to financial impacts to our businesses or our offerings financial risks arise from the following seasonality excessive subscription cancellations and product returns unanticipated changes in income tax rates adverse global macroeconomic conditions credit risks fluctuations in our net income indebtedness and the fluctuation of our stock price 



tables of contents 

our tax business is highly seasonal and our quarterly results fluctuate significantly 

our tax offerings have significant seasonal patterns revenue from income tax preparation products and services is typically heavily concentrated during november through april and for the 2019 tax season this seasonality was affected by the irs’s extension of the federal tax filing deadline to july 15 2020 and all states with personal income tax also extending their due dates predominantly to july this seasonality has caused significant fluctuations in our quarterly financial results our financial results may also fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year due to a variety of factors including factors that may affect the timing of revenue recognition these include changes to our offerings that result in the inclusion or exclusion of ongoing services changes in product pricing strategies or product sales mix the timing of the availability of federal and state tax forms from taxing agencies and the ability of those agencies to receive electronic tax return submissions changes in customer behavior and the timing of our discontinuation of support for older product offerings other factors that may affect our quarterly or annual financial results include the timing of acquisitions divestitures and goodwill and acquired intangible asset impairment charges any fluctuations in our operating results may adversely affect our stock price 

if actual customer refunds for our offerings exceed the amount we have reserved our future financial results may be harmed 

like many software companies we refund customers for product returns and subscription cancellations we establish reserves against revenue in our financial statements based on estimated customer refunds we closely monitor this refund activity in an effort to maintain adequate reserves in the past customer refunds have not differed significantly from these reserves however if we experience actual customer refunds or an increase in risks of collecting customer payments including as a result of financial hardship experienced by our customers related to the covid19 pandemic that significantly exceed the amount we have reserved it may result in lower net revenue 

unanticipated changes in our income tax rates or other indirect tax may affect our future financial results 

our future effective income tax rates may be favorably or unfavorably affected by unanticipated changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities by changes in our stock price or by changes in tax laws or their interpretation foreign governments may enact tax laws that could result in further changes to global taxation and materially affect our financial position and results of operations in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes these continuous examinations may result in unforeseen taxrelated liabilities which may harm our future financial results 

an increasing number of states and foreign jurisdictions have adopted laws or administrative practices that impose new taxes on all or a portion of gross revenue or other similar amounts or impose additional obligations to collect transaction taxes such as sales consumption value added or similar taxes we may not have sufficient lead time to build systems and processes to collect these taxes properly or at all failure to comply with such laws or administrative practices or a successful assertion by such states or foreign jurisdictions requiring us to collect taxes where we do not could result in material tax liabilities including for past sales as well as penalties and interest 

adverse global economic conditions could harm our business and financial condition 

adverse macroeconomic developments could negatively affect our business and financial condition adverse global economic events have caused and could in the future cause disruptions and volatility in global financial markets and increased rates of default and bankruptcy and could impact consumer and small business spending in particular because the majority of our revenue is derived from sales within the us economic conditions in the us have an even greater impact on us than companies with a more diverse international presence challenging economic times could cause potential new customers not to purchase or to delay purchasing our products and services and could cause our existing customers to discontinue purchasing or delay upgrades of our existing products and services thereby negatively impacting our revenues and future financial results decreased consumer spending levels could also reduce credit and debit card transaction processing volumes causing reductions in our payments revenue poor economic conditions and high unemployment have caused and could in the future cause a significant decrease in the number of tax returns filed which may have a significant effect on the number of tax returns we prepare and file in addition weakness in the enduser consumer and small business markets could negatively affect the cash flow of our distributors and resellers who could in turn delay paying their obligations to us which could increase our credit risk exposure and cause delays in our recognition of revenue or future sales to these customers any of these events could harm our business and our future financial results 

the covid19 pandemic and the actions taken in response to it have significantly increased economic and demand uncertainty the covid19 pandemic has caused a global recession and we cannot predict the extent to which existing small businesses will be able to survive such a downturn moreover in connection with the covid19 pandemic unemployment has increased significantly accordingly the risks described in the paragraph above including reduced customer demand for our products and services decreased consumer spending levels and in the future decreases in the number of tax returns filed may be more likely to materialize any of which could harm our business and our future financial results

we provide capital to small businesses which exposes us to certain risk and may cause us material financial or reputational harm 

we provide capital to qualified small businesses which exposes us to the risk of our borrowers’ inability to repay such loans we have also entered into credit arrangements with financial institutions to obtain the capital we provide under this offering any termination or interruption in the financial institutions’ ability to lend to us could interrupt our ability to provide capital to qualified small businesses further our credit decisioning pricing loss forecasting scoring and other models used to evaluate loan applications may contain errors or may not adequately assess creditworthiness of our borrowers or may be otherwise ineffective resulting in incorrect approvals or denials of loans it is also possible that loan applicants could provide false or incorrect information moreover the covid19 pandemic and the actions taken in response to it have had a significant impact on small businesses and may increase the likelihood that our borrowers are unable to repay their loans if any of the foregoing events were to occur our reputation relationships with borrowers collections of loans receivable and financial results could be harmed in addition one of our subsidiaries is a lender and a servicer under the ppp to support our small business customers and other eligible applicants during the pandemic our participation in this program exposes us to many of the risks described above and additional risks such as borrower default the sba declining to forgive or honor its guarantee with respect to ppp loans and litigation or other disputes with borrowers or others related to our ppp activities 

amortization of acquired intangible assets and impairment charges may cause significant fluctuation in our net income 

our acquisitions have resulted in significant expenses including amortization and impairment of acquired technology and other acquired intangible assets and impairment of goodwill total costs and expenses in these categories were 28 million in fiscal 2020 26 million in fiscal 2019 and 21 million in fiscal 2018 although under current accounting rules goodwill is not amortized we may incur impairment charges related to the goodwill already recorded and to goodwill arising out of future acquisitions we test the impairment of goodwill annually in our fourth fiscal quarter or more frequently if indicators of impairment arise the timing of the formal annual test may result in charges to our statement of operations in our fourth fiscal quarter that may not have been reasonably foreseen in prior periods at july 31 2020  we had 17 billion in goodwill and 28 million in net acquired intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheet both of which may be subject to impairment charges in the future new acquisitions and any impairment of the value of acquired intangible assets may have a significant negative impact on our future financial results 

we have incurred indebtedness and may incur other debt in the future which may adversely affect our financial condition and future financial results 

as of july 31 2020  we had an aggregate of 34 billion of indebtedness outstanding under our credit facilities and our senior unsecured notes under the agreements governing our indebtedness we are permitted to incur additional debt this debt and any debt that we may incur in the future may adversely affect our financial condition and future financial results by among other things 

 if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt we may be required among other things to seek additional financing in the debt or equity markets refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness sell selected assets or reduce or delay planned capital operating or investment expenditures such measures may not be sufficient to enable us to service our debt 

additionally the agreements governing our indebtedness impose restrictions on us and require us to comply with certain covenants for example our credit facilities restrict the ability of our subsidiaries to incur indebtedness and require us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios our ability to comply with these ratios may be affected by events beyond our control in addition our credit facilities and the indenture governing our senior unsecured notes limit our ability to create liens our and subsidiaries’ assets and engage in sale and leaseback transactions if we breach any of these covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders or the noteholders as applicable then subject to applicable cure periods any or all of our outstanding indebtedness may be declared immediately due and payable there can be no assurance that any refinancing or additional financing would be available on terms that are favorable or acceptable to us if at all 

under the terms of our outstanding senior unsecured notes we may be required to repurchase the notes for cash prior to their maturity in connection with the occurrence of certain changes of control that are accompanied by certain downgrades in the credit ratings of the notes the repayment obligations under the notes may have the effect of discouraging delaying or preventing a takeover of our company if we were required to pay the notes prior to their scheduled maturity it could have a negative impact on our cash position and liquidity and impair our ability to invest financial resources in other strategic initiatives 



tables of contents 

in addition changes by any rating agency to our credit rating may negatively impact the value and liquidity of both our debt and equity securities if our credit ratings are downgraded or other negative action is taken the interest rate payable by us under our unsecured revolving credit facility may increase in addition any downgrades in our credit ratings may affect our ability to obtain additional financing in the future and may negatively impact the terms of any such financing 

we cannot guarantee that our share repurchase program will be fully consummated or that it will enhance longterm stockholder value 

we have a stock repurchase program under which we are authorized to repurchase our common stock the repurchase program does not have an expiration date and we are not obligated to repurchase a specified number or dollar value of shares our repurchase program may be suspended or terminated at any time for example in connection with our pending acquisition of credit karma we have temporarily suspended share repurchases under our repurchase program in compliance with applicable federal securities laws even if our stock repurchase program is fully implemented it may not enhance longterm stockholder value also the amount timing and execution of our stock repurchase programs may fluctuate based on our priorities for the use of cash for other purposes and because of changes in cash flows tax laws and the market price of our common stock 

our stock price may be volatile and your investment could lose value 

our stock price is subject to changes in recommendations or earnings estimates by financial analysts changes in investors’ or analysts’ valuation measures for our stock our credit ratings and market trends unrelated to our performance furthermore speculation in the press or investment community about our strategic position financial condition results of operations business or security of our products can cause changes in our stock price these factors as well as general economic and political conditions including the effects of the covid19 pandemic and the timing of announcements in the public market regarding new products product enhancements or technological advances by our competitors or us and any announcements by us of acquisitions major transactions or management changes may adversely affect our stock price moreover the covid19 pandemic has caused significant volatility in the global financial markets which has resulted in significant volatility in our stock price recently further any changes in the amounts or frequency of share repurchases or dividends may also adversely affect our stock price a significant drop in our stock price could expose us to the risk of securities class actions lawsuits which may result in substantial costs and divert management’s attention and resources which may adversely affect our business

 item 3  legal proceedings 

tableend

beginning in may 2019 various legal proceedings were filed and certain regulatory inquiries were commenced in connection with our provision and marketing of free online tax preparation programs we believe that the allegations contained within these legal proceedings are without merit we intend to vigorously defend against the legal proceedings and cooperate in the inquiries these proceedings include multiple putative class actions that were consolidated into a single putative class action in the northern district of california in september 2019 and demands for arbitration that were filed beginning in october 2019 

to date the legal and other fees we have incurred related to these proceedings and inquiries have not been material the ongoing defense and any resolution or settlement of these proceedings and inquiries could involve significant costs to us in view of the complexity and ongoing nature of these proceedings and inquiries at this time we are unable to estimate a reasonably possible financial loss or range of financial loss that we may incur to resolve or settle these matters 

as of july 31 2020 there are approximately 42000 individual arbitration claims pending and we could incur significant arbitration and legal fees associated with the defense of these claims in fiscal year 2020 we recorded approximately 14 million in arbitration fees related to these claims the arbitration fees are accrued when invoiced or when the services are rendered we are disputing the applicability and propriety of these fees however we could incur additional arbitration fees of approximately 120 million related to these claims in the future these additional fees could be incurred beginning in fiscal 2021 

intuit is subject to certain routine legal proceedings including class action lawsuits as well as demands claims government inquiries and threatened litigation that arise in the normal course of our business including assertions that we may be infringing patents or other intellectual property rights of others our failure to obtain necessary license or other rights or litigation arising out of intellectual property claims could adversely affect our business we currently believe that in addition to any amounts accrued the amount of potential losses if any for any pending claims of any type either alone or combined will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements the ultimate outcome of any legal proceeding is uncertain and regardless of outcome legal proceedings can have an adverse impact on intuit because of defense costs negative publicity diversion of management resources and other factors

you should note that this mda contains forwardlooking statements that involve risks and uncertainties please see the section entitled “forwardlooking statements” immediately preceding part i for important information to consider when evaluating such statements 

you should read this mda in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes in item 8 of this annual report 

effective august 1 2019 we adopted the new lease standard using the modified retrospective approach under which financial results reported in prior periods were not restated see note 1 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report for more information 

in fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019 we acquired several companies including tsheetscom llc exactor inc and applatix inc we have included their results of operations in our consolidated results of operations from their respective dates of acquisition see note 6 in item 8 of this annual report for more information 

in march 2020 the world health organization declared the covid19 outbreak as a pandemic the covid19 pandemic has had significant adverse impacts on the us and global economies we are conducting business with substantial modifications to employee work locations and employee travel among other modifications while we have not experienced significant disruptions to our operations thus far from the covid19 pandemic we are unable to predict the full impact that the covid19 pandemic will have on our operations and future financial performance including demand for our offerings impact to our customers and partners actions that may be taken by governmental authorities and other factors identified in “risk factors” in item 1a of part i of this report 

in april 2020 intuit was approved as a nonbank small business administration lender for the paycheck protection program ppp the ppp was authorized under the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act cares act to provide small businesses loans to pay payroll and group health costs salaries and commissions mortgage and rent payments utilities and interest on other debt which is designed to provide assistance to small businesses during the covid19 pandemic 



this overview provides a high level discussion of our operating results and some of the trends that affect our business we believe that an understanding of these trends is important in order to understand our financial results for fiscal 2020 as well as our future prospects this summary is not intended to be exhaustive nor is it a substitute for the detailed discussion and analysis provided elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 



industry trends 

artificial intelligence ai is transforming multiple industries including financial technology disruptive startups emerging ecosystems and megaplatforms are harnessing new technology to create personalized experiences deliver datadriven insights and increase speed of service these shifts are creating a more dynamic and highly competitive environment where customer expectations are shifting around the world as more services become digitized and the array of choices continues to increase

seasonality 

historically our consumer and strategic partner offerings have had a significant and distinct seasonal pattern as sales and revenue from our income tax preparation products and services are heavily concentrated in the period from november through april this seasonal pattern has historically resulted in higher net revenues during our second and third quarters ending january 31 and april 30 respectively in march 2020 as a relief measure in response to the covid19 pandemic the irs extended the filing deadline for the 2019 tax year from april 15 2020 to july 15 2020 additionally all states with a personal income tax also extended their due dates predominantly to july as a result there was a shift in sales and revenue from our third fiscal quarter to our fourth fiscal quarter during fiscal 2020 we expect the seasonality of our consumer and strategic partner businesses to continue to have a significant impact on our quarterly financial results in the future 



our growth strategy depends upon our ability to initiate and embrace disruptive technology trends to enter new markets and to drive broad adoption of the products and services we develop and market our future growth also increasingly depends on the strength of our thirdparty business relationships and our ability to continue to develop maintain and strengthen new and existing relationships to remain competitive and continue to grow we are investing significant resources in our product development marketing and sales capabilities and we expect to continue to do so in the future 

as we offer more online services the ongoing operation and availability of our platforms and systems and those of our external service providers is becoming increasingly important because we help customers manage their financial lives we face risks associated with the hosting collection use and retention of personal customer information and data we are investing significant management attention and resources in our information technology infrastructure and in our privacy and security capabilities and we expect to continue to do so in the future 

for our consumer and professional tax offerings we have implemented additional security measures and are continuing to work with state and federal governments to implement industrywide security and antifraud measures including sharing information regarding suspicious filings we continue to invest in security measures and to work with the broader industry and government to protect our customers against this type of fraud 

for a complete discussion of the most significant risks and uncertainties affecting our business please see “forwardlooking statements” immediately preceding part i and “risk factors” in item 1a of part i of this report 



the most important financial indicators that we use to assess our business are revenue growth for the company as a whole and for each reportable segment operating income growth for the company as a whole earnings per share and cash flow from operations we also track certain nonfinancial drivers of revenue growth and when material identify them in the applicable discussions of segment results below service offerings are a significant part of our business our total service and other revenue was 60 billion or 79 of our total revenue in fiscal 2020 and we expect our total service and other revenue to continue to grow in the future

key highlights for fiscal 2020 include the following 



we ended fiscal 2020 with cash cash equivalents and investments totaling 71 billion  



in preparing our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap we are required to make estimates assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on our net revenue operating income or loss and net income or loss as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets we believe that the estimates assumptions and judgments involved in the following accounting policies have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies 

 our senior management has reviewed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and their disclosure in this annual report on form 10k with the audit and risk committee of our board of directors 

revenue recognition 

we derive our revenue primarily from the sale of online services such as tax accounting payroll merchant payment processing and from packaged desktop software products and desktop software subscriptions our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services in determining how revenue should be recognized a fivestep process is used which requires judgment and estimates within the revenue recognition process the primary judgments include identifying the performance obligations in the contract and determining whether the performance obligations are distinct if any of these judgments were to change it could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue we report in a particular period for additional information see “revenue recognition” in note 1 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report 

business combinations 

as described in “description of business and summary of significant accounting policies – business combinations” in note 1 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report under the acquisition method of accounting we generally recognize the identifiable assets acquired the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interests in an acquiree at their fair values as of 



tables of contents 

the date of acquisition we measure goodwill as the excess of consideration transferred which we also measure at fair value over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed the acquisition method of accounting requires us to exercise judgment and make significant estimates and assumptions regarding the fair values of the elements of a business combination as of the date of acquisition including the fair values of identifiable intangible assets deferred tax asset valuation allowances liabilities related to uncertain tax positions and contingencies this method also requires us to refine these estimates over a oneyear measurement period to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that if known would have affected the measurement of the amounts recognized as of that date if we are required to retroactively adjust provisional amounts that we have recorded for the fair values of assets and liabilities in connection with acquisitions these adjustments could materially decrease our operating income and net income and result in lower asset values on our consolidated balance sheet 

significant estimates and assumptions that we must make in estimating the fair value of acquired technology customer lists and other identifiable intangible assets include future cash flows that we expect to generate from the acquired assets if the subsequent actual results and updated projections of the underlying business activity change compared with the assumptions and projections used to develop these values we could record impairment charges in addition we have estimated the economic lives of certain acquired assets and these lives are used to calculate depreciation and amortization expense if our estimates of the economic lives change depreciation or amortization expenses could be accelerated or slowed 

goodwill acquired intangible assets and other longlived assets – impairment assessments 

we estimate the fair value of acquired intangible assets and other longlived assets that have finite useful lives whenever an event or change in circumstances indicates that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable we test for potential impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives annually in our fourth fiscal quarter or whenever indicators of impairment arise the timing of the annual test may result in charges to our consolidated statement of operations in our fourth fiscal quarter that could not have been reasonably foreseen in prior periods 

as described in “description of business and summary of significant accounting policies – goodwill acquired intangible assets and other longlived assets” in note 1 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report in order to estimate the fair value of goodwill we use a weighted combination of a discounted cash flow model known as the income approach and comparisons to publicly traded companies engaged in similar businesses known as the market approach the income approach requires us to use a number of assumptions including market factors specific to the business the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows to be generated by the business over an extended period of time longterm growth rates for the business and a rate of return that considers the relative risk of achieving the cash flows and the time value of money we evaluate cash flows at the reporting unit level although the assumptions we use in our discounted cash flow model are consistent with the assumptions we use to generate our internal strategic plans and forecasts significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of future cash flows from each reporting unit and the relative risk of achieving those cash flows when using the market approach we make judgments about the comparability of publicly traded companies engaged in similar businesses we base our judgments on factors such as size growth rates profitability risk and return on investment we also make judgments when adjusting market multiples of revenue operating income and earnings for these companies to reflect their relative similarity to our own businesses see note 5 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report for a summary of goodwill by reportable segment 

we estimate the recoverability of acquired intangible assets and other longlived assets that have finite useful lives by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows that we expect the asset to generate in order to estimate the fair value of those assets we estimate the present value of future cash flows from those assets the key assumptions that we use in our discounted cash flow model are the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows to be generated by the asset over an extended period of time and a rate of return that considers the relative risk of achieving the cash flows and the time value of money significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of future cash flows and the relative risk of achieving those cash flows we also make judgments about the remaining useful lives of acquired intangible assets and other longlived assets that have finite lives see note 5 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report for a summary of cost accumulated amortization and weighted average life in years for our acquired intangible assets 

assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives are complex and often subjective they can be affected by a variety of factors including external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts for example if our future operating results do not meet current forecasts or if we experience a sustained decline in our market capitalization that is determined to be indicative of a reduction in fair value of one or more of our reporting units we may be required to record future impairment charges for goodwill and acquired intangible assets impairment charges could materially decrease our future net income and result in lower asset values on our consolidated balance sheet 

during the fourth quarters of fiscal 2020  fiscal 2019  and fiscal 2018 we performed our annual goodwill impairment tests using the methodology described in “description of business and summary of significant accounting policies – goodwill acquired intangible assets and other longlived assets” in note 1 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report we determined that the estimated fair values of all of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values and that they were not impaired in addition during this analysis we concluded that the estimated fair values of all of our reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying values

accounting for sharebased compensation plans 

restricted stock units rsus granted typically vest based on continued service we value these timebased rsus at the date of grant using the intrinsic value method we amortize the fair value of timebased rsus on a straightline basis over the service period certain rsus granted to senior management vest based on the achievement of preestablished performance or market goals we estimate the fair value of performancebased rsus at the date of grant using the intrinsic value method and the probability that the specified performance criteria will be met each quarter we update our assessment of the probability that the specified performance criteria will be achieved and adjust our estimate of the fair value of the performancebased rsus if necessary we amortize the fair values of performancebased rsus over the requisite service period for each separately vesting tranche of the award we estimate the fair value of marketbased rsus at the date of grant using a monte carlo valuation methodology and amortize those fair values over the requisite service period for each separately vesting tranche of the award the monte carlo methodology that we use to estimate the fair value of marketbased rsus at the date of grant incorporates into the valuation the possibility that the market condition may not be satisfied provided that the requisite service is rendered the total fair value of the marketbased rsus at the date of grant must be recognized as compensation expense even if the market condition is not achieved however the number of shares that ultimately vest can vary significantly with the performance of the specified market criteria all of the rsus we grant have dividend rights that are subject to the same vesting requirements as the underlying equity awards so we do not adjust the intrinsic market value of our rsus for dividends 

we use a lattice binomial model and the assumptions described in note 11 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report to estimate the fair value of stock options granted we estimate the expected term of options granted based on implied exercise patterns using a binomial model we estimate the volatility of our common stock at the date of grant based on the implied volatility of publicly traded oneyear and twoyear options on our common stock our decision to use implied volatility is based upon the availability of actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility we base the riskfree interest rate that we use in our option valuation model on the implied yield in effect at the time of option grant on constant maturity us treasury issues with equivalent remaining terms we use an annualized expected dividend yield in our option valuation model we adjust sharebased compensation expense for actual forfeitures as they occur we amortize the fair value of options on a straightline basis over the requisite service periods of the awards which are generally the vesting periods we may elect to use different assumptions under our option valuation model in the future which could materially affect our net income or loss and net income or loss per share see note 11 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report for more information 

legal contingencies 

we are subject to certain legal proceedings as well as demands claims and threatened litigation that arise in the normal course of our business we review the status of each significant matter quarterly and assess our potential financial exposure if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated we record a liability and an expense for the estimated loss if we determine that a loss is possible and the range of the loss can be reasonably determined then we disclose the range of the possible loss significant judgment is required in the determination of whether a potential loss is probable reasonably possible or remote as well as in the determination of whether a potential exposure is reasonably estimable our accruals are based on the best information available at the time as additional information becomes available we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates potential legal liabilities and the revision of estimates of potential legal liabilities could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations see note 13 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report for more information 

accounting for income taxes – estimates of deferred taxes valuation allowances and uncertain tax positions 

we estimate our income taxes based on the various jurisdictions where we conduct business significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax rules and the potential for future adjustment of our uncertain tax positions by the united states internal revenue service or other taxing jurisdictions we estimate our current tax liability and assess temporary differences that result from differing treatments of certain items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which we show on our consolidated balance sheet we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized to the extent we believe that realization is not likely we establish a valuation allowance when we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in an accounting period we record a corresponding tax expense in our consolidated statement of operations 

we record a valuation allowance to reflect uncertainties about whether we will be able to utilize our deferred tax assets before they expire we assess the need for an adjustment to the valuation allowance on a quarterly basis the assessment is based on our estimates of future sources of taxable income in the jurisdictions in which we operate and the periods over which our deferred tax assets will be realizable while we have considered future taxable income in assessing the need for a valuation allowance for the periods presented we could in the future be required to increase the valuation allowance to take into account additional deferred tax assets that we may be unable to realize an increase in the valuation allowance could have an adverse impact on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which we record the change 



tables of contents 

we recognize and measure benefits for uncertain tax positions using a twostep approach the first step is to evaluate the tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon audit including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes for tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely of being realized upon settlement significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions we evaluate our uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis our evaluations are based upon a number of factors including changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law correspondence with tax authorities during the course of audits and effective settlement of audit issues changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in material increases or decreases in our income tax expense in the period in which we make the change which could have a material impact on our effective tax rate and operating results see note 10 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report for more information

at july 31 2020  our cash cash equivalents and investments totaled 71 billion  an increase of 43 billion from july 31 2019 due to the factors described in “statements of cash flows” below our primary sources of liquidity have been cash from operations which includes the collection of accounts receivable for products and services the issuance of senior unsecured notes and borrowings under our credit facilities our primary uses of cash have been for research and development programs selling and marketing activities repurchases of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs the payment of cash dividends debt service costs and debt repayment acquisitions of businesses and capital projects as discussed in “executive overview – industry trends and seasonality” earlier in this item 7 our business is subject to significant seasonality the balance of our cash cash equivalents and investments generally fluctuates with that seasonal pattern we believe the seasonality of our business is likely to continue in the future 

the following table summarizes selected measures of our liquidity and capital resources at the dates indicated 



we have historically generated significant cash from operations and we expect to continue to do so during fiscal 2021  our cash cash equivalents and investments totaled 71 billion at july 31 2020  none of those funds were restricted and approximately 97 of those funds were located in the us 

in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 we borrowed the full 1 billion under our unsecured revolving credit facility and issued 2 billion in senior unsecured notes for general corporate purposes which may include funding a portion of the pending acquisition of credit karma and other possible acquisitions of businesses or assets or strategic investments in august 2020 we repaid the 1 billion outstanding under the revolving credit facility see “commitments for senior unsecured notes” later in this item 7 for more information 

based on past performance and current expectations we believe that our cash and cash equivalents investments and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet anticipated seasonal working capital needs capital expenditure requirements contractual obligations including the pending acquisition of credit karma commitments debt service requirements and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations for at least the next 12 months we believe that our financial resources will allow us to manage the impact of covid19 on our business operations for the foreseeable future which could include potential reductions in revenue and delays in payments from customers and partners 

we expect to return excess cash generated by operations to our stockholders through payment of cash dividends after taking into account our operating and strategic cash needs in connection with our pending acquisition of credit karma we have temporarily suspended share repurchases 

our secured revolving credit facility is available to fund a portion of our loans to qualified small businesses at july 31 2020  48 million was outstanding under the secured revolving credit facility see “credit facilities” later in this item 7 for more information 

we evaluate on an ongoing basis the merits of acquiring technology or businesses or establishing strategic relationships with and investing in other companies our strong liquidity profile enables us to quickly respond to these kinds of opportunities

 item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend

investment portfolio and interest rate risk 

we actively monitor market conditions and developments specific to the securities in which we invest we believe that we take a conservative approach to investing our funds in that we invest only in highlyrated securities and diversify our portfolio of investments while we believe we take prudent measures to mitigate investmentrelated risks such risks cannot be fully eliminated because of market circumstances that are outside our control 

our investments consist of instruments that meet quality standards that are consistent with our investment policy this policy specifies that except for direct obligations of the united states government securities issued by agencies of the united states government and money market funds we diversify our investments by limiting our holdings with any individual issuer we do not hold derivative financial instruments or european sovereign debt in our portfolio of investments see note 2 and note 3 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report for a summary of the amortized cost and fair value of our investments by type of issue 

our cash equivalents and investments are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates interest rate movements affect the interest income we earn on cash equivalents and investments and the value of those investments at july 31 2020  our cash equivalents and investments totaled 66 billion and had a weighted average pretax yield of 0292  total interest income for fiscal 2020 was 39 million  if the federal reserve target rate had increased by 25 basis points from the level of july 31 2020  the value of our investments at that date would have decreased by approximately 2 million if the federal reserve target rate had increased by 100 basis points from the level of july 31 2020  the value of our investments at that date would have decreased by approximately 7 million 

we are also exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates as they affect our 1 billion unsecured revolving credit facility400 million unsecured term loan and 300 million secured revolving credit facility advances under the unsecured revolving credit facility accrue interest at rates that are equal to bank of america’s alternate base rate plus a margin that ranges from 00 to 01 or the london interbank offered rate libor plus a margin that ranges from 069 to 11 the term loan accrues interest at rates that are equal to at our election either bank of americas alternate base rate plus a margin that ranges from 00 to 0125 or libor plus a margin that ranges from 0625 to 1125 actual margins under all of these elections are based on our senior debt credit ratings advances under the secured revolving credit facility accrue interest at a rate of libor plus 239  consequently our interest expense fluctuates with changes in the general level of these interest rates at july 31 2020 1 billion was outstanding under the unsecured revolving credit facility 338 million was outstanding under the term loan and 48 million was outstanding under the secured revolving credit facility in august 2020 we repaid the 1 billion outstanding under this revolving credit facility see note 7 and note 8 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report for more information 

in june 2020 we issued 2 billion of senior unsecured notes which was comprised of the following 500 million of 0650 notes due in july 2023 500 million of 0950 notes due in july 2025 500 million of 1350 notes due in july 2027 and 500 million of 1650 notes due in july 2030 we carry these notes at face value less unamortized discount and unamortized debt issuance costs on our consolidated balance sheet since these notes bear interest at fixed rates we have no financial statement risk associated with changes in interest rates however the fair value of these notes fluctuates when interest rates change see note 2 and note 8 to the financial statements in item 8 of this report for more information 

impact of foreign currency rate changes 

the functional currencies of our international operating subsidiaries are generally the local currencies we translate the assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries at the exchange rates in effect on the balance sheet date we translate their revenue costs and expenses at the average rates of exchange in effect during the period we include translation gains and losses in the stockholders’ equity section of our consolidated balance sheets we include net gains and losses resulting from foreign exchange transactions in interest and other income in our consolidated statements of operations 

since we translate foreign currencies primarily canadian dollars indian rupees and british pounds into us dollars for financial reporting purposes currency fluctuations can have an impact on our financial results the historical impact of currency fluctuations on our financial results has generally been immaterial we believe that our exposure to currency exchange fluctuation risk is not significant because our global subsidiaries invoice customers and satisfy their financial obligations almost exclusively in their local currencies we believe the impact of currency fluctuations will continue to not be significant in the foreseeable future due to the reasons cited above as of july 31 2020  we did not engage in foreign currency hedging activities

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in exchange act rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of july 31 2020 based on the guidelines established in internal control – integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso based on the results of this evaluation our management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of july 31 2020 to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles we reviewed the results of management’s assessment with the audit and risk committee of intuit’s board of directors 

ernst  young llp an independent registered public accounting firm has audited the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of july 31 2020  their report is included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

during our most recent fiscal quarter there has not occurred any change in our internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls 

our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer believes that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and that they are effective at the reasonable assurance level however no matter how well conceived and executed a control system can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met the design of any control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs there are also limitations that are inherent in any control system these limitations include the realities that breakdowns can occur because of errors in judgment or mistakes and that controls can be circumvented by individual persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls because of these inherent limitations in a cost effective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected

the markets for software and related services are characterized by rapid technological change shifting customer needs and frequent new product introductions and enhancements continuous investment is required to innovate and develop new products and services as well as enhance existing offerings to be successful in these markets our product development efforts are more important than ever as we pursue our growth strategy 

we develop many of our products and services internally and we have a number of united states and foreign patents and pending applications that relate to various aspects of our products and technology we also supplement our internal development efforts by acquiring or licensing products and technology from third parties and establishing other relationships that enable us to enhance or expand our offerings more rapidly we expect to expand our thirdparty technology relationships as we continue to pursue our growth strategy 

while our traditional desktop software products – quickbooks turbotax lacerte and proseries – tend to have predictable annual development and product release cycles as we move to more online offerings and mobile applications the development cycles are becoming more rapid in addition developing consumer and professional tax software and services presents unique challenges because of the demanding development cycle required to accurately incorporate federal and state tax law and tax form changes within a rigid timetable the development timing for our small business payroll and merchant payment processing services offerings varies with business needs and regulatory requirements and the length of the development cycle depends on the scope and complexity of each project 

we continue to make substantial investments in research and development and we expect to focus our future research and development efforts on enhancing existing products and services with financial recommendations personalization and ease of use enabled by ai and other advanced technologies we continue to focus on developing new products and services including new mobile and global offerings and significant research and development efforts for ongoing projects to update the technology platforms for several of our offerings 



tables of contents 



our consumer and strategic partner offerings have a significant and distinct seasonal pattern as sales and revenue from our income tax preparation products and services are heavily concentrated in the period from november through april this seasonal pattern results in higher net revenues during our second and third quarters ending january 31 and april 30 respectively we expect the seasonality of our consumer and strategic partner businesses to continue to have a significant impact on our quarterly financial results in the future 



markets 

our primary customers are consumers small businesses and the selfemployed we also provide specialized tax and accounting products to professional accountants who are key partners to help us reach small business customers the markets in which we compete have always been characterized by rapid technological change shifting customer needs and frequent new product introductions and enhancements by competitors over the past several years the widespread usage of mobile devices and the explosion of social media have accelerated the pace of change and revolutionized the way that customers learn about evaluate and purchase products and services 

realtime personalized online and mobile shopping experiences are the standard in addition many customers now begin shopping in one channel and ultimately purchase in another this has created a need for integrated multichannel shopandbuy experiences market and industry changes quickly make existing products and services obsolete our success depends on our ability to respond rapidly to these changes with new business models updated competitive strategies new or enhanced products and services alternative distribution methods and other changes in the way we do business 

marketing programs 

we use a variety of marketing programs to generate direct sales develop leads increase general awareness of our product portfolio and drive sales in retail these programs include digital marketing such as display and payperclick advertising search engine optimization and social and affiliate marketing mobile marketing through online app stores email marketing offline marketing such as tv radio billboard magazine and newspaper advertising retail marketing public relations and in product marketing to drive awareness of related products and services our campaigns are designed to attract new users retain existing users and cross sell additional offerings 

sales and distribution channels 

multichannel shopandbuy experiences  our customers use the web and mobile devices to research products and services some customers buy and use our products and services entirely online or through their mobile devices others research online but make their purchase at a retail location because many customers shop across multiple channels we continue to coordinate our online offline and retail presence and promotions to support an integrated multichannel shopandbuy model we also focus on crossselling complementary intuit and thirdparty offerings online and inproduct 

direct sales channel  we sell many of our products and services directly through our websites and call centers direct online sales are an effective channel for customers who can make purchase decisions based on content provided on our websites via other online content or word of mouth recommendations telesales continues to be an effective channel for serving customers that want live help to select the products and services that are right for their needs we also have a direct sales force that calls on us and international accounting firms and seeks to increase their awareness usage and recommendation of our small business and professional tax solutions

overview 

we face intense competition in all of our businesses both domestically and internationally competitive interest and expertise in many of the markets we serve have grown markedly over the past few years and we expect this trend to continue some of our existing competitors have significantly greater financial technical and marketing resources than we do in addition the competitive landscape can shift rapidly as new companies enter and existing companies expand their businesses to include the markets in which we compete this is particularly true for online and mobile products and services where the barriers to entry are lower than they are for desktop software products and services to attract customers many online and mobile competitors are offering free or lowpriced products which we must take into account in our pricing strategies 

given the breadth of the products and services that we offer as a global technology company we compete with the offerings from a variety of companies across a range of industries our most obvious competition comes from other companies that currently offer technology solutions similar to ours in our small business  selfemployed segment we face competition from a variety of companies that provide products or services to address the problems that we help our customers to solve including getting paid faster paying their employees accessing capital and ensuring their books are done right our consumer segment competes with companies that offer products and services to help customers file their taxes better manage their money and reduce their debt we may also face competition from companies with platforms that could be developed to offer competing technology solutions to any of the problems that our customers may face such as facebook amazon and google in addition for many of our products and services other competitive alternatives for customers are thirdparty service providers such as professional accountants and seasonal tax preparation businesses manual tools and processes or generalpurpose software are also important competitive alternatives in some cases a competitor in one of our segments may be our partner in another one of our segments in other cases a company may compete with us in more than one of our segments 

competition specific to segments 

small business  selfemployed segment  quickbooks is the leading small business financial management software in the us small businesses often look to several companies to address their problems therefore our small business products and services face competitive challenges from a variety of companies that provide products or services that address one or more of their problems we compete to help small businesses get their books right with the sage group plc xero and freshbooks among others which offer software and associated services as well as online accounting offerings that directly serve small business customers for small businesses with more complex financial management needs our competitors include the sage group plc’s intacct offering and microsoft dynamics we also compete with free or lowcost online accounting offerings and free online banking and bill payment services offered by financial institutions and others in our payroll business we compete directly with automatic data processing inc adp paychex gusto and many other companies that help small businesses to pay their employees in our merchant services business we help our customers get paid faster and compete directly with large financial institutions such as wells fargo jp morgan chase and bank of america and with many payment processors including first data corporation elavon global payments fidelity national information services paypal and square our quickbooks capital offering which helps small businesses to access capital competes with a range of lending enterprises including large financial institutions such as the ones listed above fintech companies such as bluevine and kabbage and others 

consumer segment  in our consumer segment we compete to help our customers to file their taxes our future growth depends on our ability to attract new customers to the selfpreparation tax category and to our assisted offering turbotax live from tax stores and other tax preparers in the us private sector we face intense competition from hr block which provides tax preparation services in its stores and a competing software offering we also face competition from several other large tax preparation service providers from a myriad of small tax preparers and from numerous online selfpreparation offerings including free tax usa taxslayer blucora’s taxact and credit karma some of these competitors are offering electronic tax preparation and filing services at no cost to individual taxpayers in canada our turbotax canada offerings face competition from hr block simpletax studiotax and ufile among others these competing offerings subject us to significant price pressure in both the us and canada 

we also face competitive challenges from government entities that offer publicly funded electronic tax preparation and filing services with no fees to individual taxpayers 

we are a member of the free file alliance a consortium of private sector companies that has entered into an agreement with the federal government under this agreement the member companies provide online federal tax preparation and filing services to eligible users at no cost to the government or individual users separate and apart from the member companies’ commercial free offerings which the irs then markets to consumers on an irs website approximately 22 states and the district of columbia have also adopted free file alliance publicprivate agreements while approximately 19 other states offer some form of direct government tax preparation and filing services with no fees to qualified taxpayers we continue to actively work with others in the private and public sectors to advance the goals of the free file alliance policy initiative and to support successful publicprivate partnerships that reinforce the voluntary compliance tax system however future administrative regulatory or legislative activity in this area could seek to replace the voluntary compliance tax system with return preparation by government agencies which could harm our consumer business 



tables of contents 

we also compete with numerous personal financial management companies such as credit karma nerdwallet and credit sesame and large financial institutions to help our customers better manage their money and reduce their debt 

strategic partner segment  in the us lacerte professional tax offerings face competition from competitivelypriced tax and accounting solutions that include integration with nontax functionality these include cch’s prosystems fx office suite and thomson reuters’ cs professional suite and gosystems tax our proseries professional tax offerings face competition from cch’s atx and taxwise offerings drake and other smaller providers in canada our profile professional tax offerings face competition from cch’s cantax and taxprep offerings taxcycle and thomson reuters’ dtmax and ufile pro offerings we also face growing competition from online tax and accounting offerings in the us and canada which may be marketed more effectively or have lower pricing than our offerings for accounting professionals 

competitive factors 

we believe the most important competitive factors for our core offerings – quickbooks turbotax lacerte and proseries – are ease of use product features size of the installed customer base brand name recognition value proposition cost reliability security and product and support quality access to distribution channels is also important for our quickbooks and turbotax desktop software products in addition support from accounting professionals and the ability for customers to upgrade within product families as their businesses grow are significant competitive factors for our quickbooks products productivity is an important competitive factor for the fullservice accounting firms to which we market our lacerte software products we believe we compete effectively on these factors as our quickbooks and turbotax products are the leading products in the us for their respective categories 

for our service offerings such as small business payroll and merchant payment processing we believe the most important competitive factors are functionality ease of use high availability security the integration of these products with related software brand name recognition effective distribution quality of support and cost 



we provide customer service and technical support by telephone email online and video chat text messaging online communities and our customer service and technical support websites we have fulltime and outsourced customer service and technical support staffs we supplement these staffs with seasonal employees and additional outsourcing during periods of peak call volumes such as during the tax return filing season or following a major product launch we outsource to several firms domestically and internationally most of our internationally outsourced small business customer service and technical support personnel are currently located in india and the philippines 

we offer free selfhelp information through our technical support websites for our quickbooks turbotax and professional tax offerings customers can also use our websites to find answers to commonly asked questions and check on the status of orders under certain paid support plans customers can also use our websites to receive product updates electronically support alternatives and fees vary by product we also sponsor online user communities where consumers can share knowledge and product advice with each other 



online products and services 

our online offerings include quickbooks online online payroll services merchant payment processing services turbotax online proconnect tax online consumer and professional electronic tax filing services mint and turbo we continue to execute on a multiyear plan to transition the systems networks and databases required to operate these online offerings to public cloud providers such as amazon web services aws currently most of our core online offerings are using aws the remaining online offerings are housed in data centers located in geographically diverse locations 

desktop software and supplies 

although an increasing proportion of our desktop software customers choose to electronically download software many customers continue to choose to purchase these products in the form of physical media the key processes in manufacturing desktop software are manufacturing compact discs cds and digital video discs dvds printing boxes and related materials and assembling and shipping the final products 

for retail manufacturing and distribution we have agreements with arvato digital services inc arvato a division of bertelsmann ag under which arvato provides a majority of the manufacturing volume for our launches of quickbooks and turbotax and daytoday replenishment after product launches as well as our retail distribution logistics arvato also provides most of the manufacturing volume and distribution services for our direct desktop software orders arvato has operations in multiple locations that can provide redundancy if necessary our model for product delivery for retail launches and replenishment is a hybrid of direct to store deliveries and shipments to central warehouse locations this allows improved inventory management by our retailers we also ship products for many of our smaller retail customers through distributors 



tables of contents 

customers typically receive desktop software electronically however when physical product is ordered we typically ship the physical product within a few days of receiving an order and backlog is minimal 



we are stewards of our customers’ data and have designed data stewardship principles to align our organization in collecting using and protecting such information as we believe strongly in being good stewards of our customers’ data we operate our program to comply with laws and regulations that regulate our use and protection of customers’ personal information including for example laws with respect to financial services and the handling of tax data we have established guidelines and practices to help ensure that customers and members of our workforce are aware of and can control how we use information about them we also use privacy statements to provide notice to customers of our privacy practices as well as provide them the opportunity to furnish instructions with respect to use of their personal information we participate in industry groups whose purpose is to develop or shape industry best practices and to inform public policy for privacy and security 

we use security safeguards to help protect the systems and the information that customers and members of our workforce give to us from loss misuse and unauthorized alteration we use technical logical and procedural measures such as multifactor authentication which are designed to help detect and prevent fraud and misuse of customer information whenever customers transmit sensitive information to us such as credit card information or tax return data through one of our websites or products we follow current industry standards to encrypt the data as it is transmitted to us and when we store it at rest we routinely patch our systems with security updates and we work to protect our systems from unauthorized internal or external access using numerous commercially available computer security products as well as internally developed security procedures and practices 



our consumer and strategic partner segments are subject to federal state and international government requirements including regulations related to the electronic filing of tax returns the provision of tax preparer assistance and the use and disclosure of customer information in addition our small business  selfemployed segment offers products and services to small businesses and consumers such as payroll payments and financing which are also subject to certain regulatory requirements 



our success depends on the proprietary technology embodied in our offerings we protect this proprietary technology by relying on a variety of intellectual property mechanisms including copyright patent trade secret and trademark laws restrictions on disclosure and other methods for example we regularly file applications for patents copyrights and trademarks and service marks in order to protect intellectual property that we believe is important to our business we hold a growing patent portfolio that we believe is important to intuit’s overall competitive advantage although we are not materially dependent on any one patent or particular group of patents in our portfolio at this time we also have a number of registered trademarks that include intuit quickbooks lacerte turbotax qb proseries proconnect and mint we have registered these and other trademarks and service marks in the united states and depending on the relevance of each brand to other markets in many foreign countries most registrations can be renewed perpetually at 10year intervals we also license intellectual property from third parties for use in our products 

although our portfolio of patents is growing the patents that have been issued to us could be determined to be invalid and may not be enforceable against competitive products in every jurisdiction in addition third parties have asserted and may in the future assert infringement claims against us and our customers these claims and any litigation may result in invalidation of our proprietary rights or a finding of infringement along with an assessment of damages litigation even if without merit could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention in addition thirdparty licenses may not continue to be available to us on commercially acceptable terms or at all 



as of july 31 2019  we had approximately 9400 employees in offices in the united states canada india the united kingdom israel australia and other locations we also employed on average approximately 2000 seasonal and contract employees during the second and third quarters of our fiscal years to support our consumer segment customers we refer to our fulltime parttime seasonal and contract employees collectively as our workforce we believe our future success and growth will depend on our ability to attract and retain a qualified workforce in all areas of our business we do not currently have any collective bargaining agreements with our employees and we believe workforce relations are generally good although we have employmentrelated agreements with a number of key employees these agreements do not guarantee continued service we believe we offer competitive compensation and a good working environment we were named one of

 item 1a  risk factors 

tableend

our businesses routinely encounter and address risks many of which could cause our future results to be materially different than we presently anticipate below we describe certain important risks categorized solely for ease of reference as strategic operational legal and compliance and financial risks the manner in which we respond to future developments as well as our competitors’ reactions to those developments may affect our future operating results 

strategic risks 

strategic risks relate to our current and future operating model business plans and growth strategy including the risks associated with the following competitive pressures on our product offerings and business models our ability to adapt to technological changes and global trends our reliance on thirdparty intellectual property and our ability to protect our own intellectual property rights the value of our brand and mergers acquisitions and divestiture activity that may have unanticipated costs and expenses 

we face intense competitive pressures that may harm our operating results 

we face intense competition in all of our businesses and we expect competition to remain intense in the future our competitors and potential competitors range from large and established entities to emerging startups our competitors may introduce superior products and services reduce prices have greater technical marketing and other resources have greater name recognition have larger installed bases of customers have wellestablished relationships with our current and potential customers advertise aggressively or beat us to market with new products and services in addition we may face competition from existing companies with large established consumer userbases and broadbased platforms who may change or expand the focus of their business strategies and marketing to target our customers including small businesses and tax customers 

we also face competition from companies with a variety of business models including increased competition from providers of free offerings particularly in our tax accounting and payments businesses in order to compete we have also introduced free offerings in several categories but we may not be able to attract customers as effectively as competitors with different business models in addition other providers of free offerings may provide features that we do not offer and customers who have formerly paid for intuit’s products and services may elect to use our competitors’ free offerings instead these competitive factors may diminish our revenue and profitability and harm our ability to acquire and retain customers 

our consumer tax business also faces significant potential competition from the public sector where we face the risk of federal and state taxing authorities proposing revenue raising strategies that involve developing and providing government tax software or other government return preparation systems at public expense these or similar programs may be introduced or expanded in the future which may change the voluntary compliance tax system in ways that could cause us to lose customers and revenue the irs free file program is currently the sole means by which the irs offers tax software to taxpayers and as part of the program the irs has agreed it will not offer a duplicative or competing service under this program the irs has worked with private industry to provide more than 56 million free returns since 2003 utilizing donated private sector tax software and efiling services for low and middle income taxpayers at no cost to the government or individual users however its continuation depends on a number of factors including increasing public awareness of and access to the free program as well as continued government support the current agreement is scheduled to expire in october 2021 recently we have become the subject of certain lawsuits and regulatory inquiries relating to the provision and marketing of the product that we offer under the irs free file program while we believe that the allegations in these proceedings are without merit the proceedings may decrease the government’s support of such program and increase the likelihood that such program is terminated if the free file program were to be terminated and the irs were to enter the software development and return preparation space the federal government would become a publicly funded direct competitor of the us tax services industry and of intuit government funded services that curtail or eliminate the role of taxpayers in preparing their own taxes could potentially have material and adverse revenue implications 

future revenue growth depends upon our ability to adapt to technological change as well as global trends in the way customers access software offerings and successfully introduce new and enhanced products services and business models 

we operate in industries that are characterized by rapidly changing technology evolving industry standards and frequent new product introductions we must continue to innovate and develop new products and features to meet changing customer needs and attract and retain talented software developers we need to continue to develop our skills tools and capabilities to capitalize on existing and emerging technologies which requires us to devote significant resources 

our consumer and professional tax businesses depend significantly on revenue from customers who return each year to use our updated tax preparation and filing software and services as our existing products mature encouraging customers to purchase product upgrades becomes more challenging unless new product releases provide features and functionality that have meaningful incremental value we also provide additional customer benefits by utilizing customer data available to us through our existing offerings if we are not able to develop and clearly demonstrate the value of new or upgraded products or services to our customers or effectively utilize our customers’ data to provide them with value our revenues may be harmed in addition as we continue to introduce and expand our new business models including offerings that are free to end 



tables of contents 

users our customers may not perceive value in the additional benefits and services we offer beyond our free offering and may choose not to pay for those additional benefits or we may be unsuccessful in increasing customer adoption of these offerings or our risk profile may change resulting in loss of revenue 

we have devoted significant resources to develop products and services for users of mobile devices but the versions of our products and services developed for these devices may not be compelling to users even if we are able to attract new users through these mobile offerings the amount of revenue that we derive per user from mobile offerings may be less than the revenue that we have historically derived from users of personal computers as new devices and new platforms are continually being released it is difficult to predict the problems we may encounter in developing versions of our products and services for use on mobile devices and we may need to devote significant resources to the creation support and maintenance of such offerings if we are slow to develop products and technologies that are compatible with mobile devices or if our competitors are able to achieve those results more quickly than us we will fail to capture a significant share of an increasingly important portion of the market for online services which could adversely affect our business further legislation or regulatory changes may mandate changes in our products that make them less attractive to users 

in some cases we may expend a significant amount of resources and management attention on offerings that do not ultimately succeed in their markets we have encountered difficulty in launching new products and services in the past if we misjudge customer needs in the future our new products and services may not succeed and our revenues and earnings may be harmed we have also invested and in the future expect to invest in new business models geographies strategies and initiatives such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties including distraction of management from current operations expenses associated with the initiatives and inadequate return on investments because these new initiatives are inherently risky they may not be successful and may harm our financial condition and operating results 

we rely on thirdparty intellectual property in our products and services 

many of our products and services include intellectual property of third parties which we license under agreements that may need to be renewed or renegotiated from time to time we may not be able to obtain licenses to these thirdparty technologies or content on reasonable terms or at all if we are unable to obtain the rights necessary to use this intellectual property in our products and services we may not be able to sell the affected offerings and customers who are currently using the affected product may be disrupted which may in turn harm our future financial results damage our brand and result in customer loss also we and our customers have been and may continue to be subject to infringement claims as a result of the thirdparty intellectual property incorporated in our offerings although we try to mitigate this risk and we may not be ultimately liable for any potential infringement pending claims require us to use significant resources require management attention and could result in loss of customers 

some of our offerings include thirdparty software that is licensed under socalled “open source” licenses some of which may include a requirement that under certain circumstances we make available or grant licenses to any modifications or derivative works we create based upon the open source software although we have established internal review and approval processes to mitigate these risks we may not be sure that all open source software is submitted for approval prior to use in our products many of the risks associated with usage of open source may not be eliminated and may if not properly addressed harm our business 

our intellectual property rights are valuable and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products services and brand 

our patents trademarks trade secrets copyrights domain names and other intellectual property rights are important assets for us we aggressively protect our intellectual property rights by relying on federal state and common law rights in the us and internationally as well as a variety of administrative procedures we also rely on contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary rights in products and services the efforts that we take to protect our proprietary rights may not always be sufficient or effective protecting our intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming and may not be successful in every location any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business our brand and our ability to compete 

policing unauthorized use and copying of our products is difficult expensive and time consuming current us laws that prohibit copying give us only limited practical protection from software piracy and the laws of many other countries provide very little protection we frequently encounter unauthorized copies of our software being sold through online marketplaces although we continue to evaluate and put in place technology solutions to attempt to lessen the impact of piracy and engage in efforts to educate consumers and public policy leaders on these issues and cooperate with industry groups in their efforts to combat piracy we expect piracy to be a persistent problem that results in lost revenues and increased expenses 

our business depends on our strong reputation and the value of our brands 

developing and maintaining awareness of our brands is critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our existing and future products and services and is an important element in attracting new customers adverse publicity whether or not justified relating to events or activities attributed to us members of our workforce agents third parties we rely on or our users may tarnish our reputation and reduce the value of our brands our brand value also depends on our ability to provide secure and trustworthy products and services as well as our ability to protect and use our customers’ data in a manner that meets their 



tables of contents 

expectations in addition a security incident which results in unauthorized disclosure of our customers’ sensitive data could cause material reputational harm damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity may reduce demand for our products and services and thus have an adverse effect on our future financial results as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of the brands and could also reduce our stock price 

our acquisition and divestiture activities may disrupt our ongoing business may involve increased expenses and may present risks not contemplated at the time of the transactions 

we have acquired and may continue to acquire companies products technologies and talent that complement our strategic direction both in and outside the united states acquisitions involve significant risks and uncertainties including 

 we have divested and may in the future divest certain assets or businesses that no longer fit with our strategic direction or growth targets divestitures involve significant risks and uncertainties including 

 in addition any acquisition or divestiture that we announce may not be completed if closing conditions are not satisfied because acquisitions and divestitures are inherently risky our transactions may not be successful and may in some cases harm our operating results or financial condition although we typically fund our acquisitions through cash available from operations if we were to use debt to fund acquisitions or for other purposes our interest expense and leverage would increase significantly and if we were to issue equity securities as consideration in an acquisition current shareholders’ percentage ownership and earnings per share would be diluted 

operational risks 

operational risks arise from internal and external events relating to systems processes and people risks that affect the operation of our businesses include the following potential security incidents privacy and cybersecurity concerns relating to online offerings fraudulent activities by third parties relationships with third parties competition for and retention of key talent issues with our product launches problems with our information technology infrastructure and risks associated with operating internationally

security incidents improper access to or disclosure of our data or customers’ data or other cyberattacks on our systems could harm our reputation and adversely affect our business 

we host collect use and retain large amounts of sensitive and personal customer and workforce data including credit card information tax return information bank account numbers login credentials and passwords personal and business financial data and transactions data social security numbers and payroll information as well as our confidential nonpublic business information we use commercially available security technologies and security and business controls to limit access to and use of such sensitive data although we expend significant resources to create security protections designed to shield this data against potential theft and security breaches such measures cannot provide absolute security 

our technologies systems and networks have been subject to and are likely to continue to be the target of cyberattacks computer viruses worms social engineering malicious software programs insider threats and other cybersecurity incidents that could result in the unauthorized release gathering monitoring use loss or destruction of sensitive and personal data of our customers and members of our workforce or intuits sensitive business data or cause temporary or sustained unavailability of our software and systems these types of attacks can be made by individuals groups of hackers and sophisticated organizations including statesponsored organizations or nationstates themselves customers who fail to update their systems continue to run software that we no longer support or that fail to install security patches on a timely basis create vulnerabilities and make it more difficult for us to detect and prevent these kinds of attacks we are increasingly incorporating open source software into our products there may be vulnerabilities in open source software that make it susceptible to cyberattacks in addition because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to sensitive information change frequently and are becoming more sophisticated and are often not able to be detected until after a successful attack we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventive measures although this is an industrywide problem that affects software and hardware across platforms it may increasingly affect our offerings because cybercriminals tend to focus their efforts on wellknown offerings that are popular among customers and hold sensitive information and we expect them to continue to do so 

further the security measures that we implement may not be able to prevent unauthorized access to our products and our customers’ account data third parties may fraudulently induce members of our workforce customers or users by social engineering means such as email phishing to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our systems it is also possible that unauthorized access to or disclosure of customer data may occur due to inadequate use of security controls by our customers or members of our workforce accounts created with weak or recycled passwords could allow cyberattackers to gain access to customer data unauthorized persons could gain access to customer accounts if customers do not maintain effective access controls of their systems and software 

criminals may also use stolen identity information obtained outside of our systems to gain unauthorized access to our customers’ data we have experienced such instances in the past and as the accessibility of stolen identity information increases generally we may experience further instances of unauthorized access to our systems through the use of stolen identity information of our customers or members of our workforce in the future further our customers may choose to use the same user id and password across multiple products and services unrelated to our products such customers’ login credentials may be stolen from products offered by thirdparty service providers unrelated to us and the stolen identity information may be used by a malicious third party to access our products which could result in disclosure of confidential information 

our efforts to protect data may also be unsuccessful due to software bugs whether open source or proprietary code breakins workforce member error or other threats that evolve 

further because we have created an ecosystem where customers can have one identity across multiple intuit products a security incident may give access to increased amounts of customer data this may result in disclosure of confidential information loss of customer confidence in our products possible litigation material harm to our reputation and financial condition disruption of our or our customers’ business operations and a decline in our stock price from time to time we detect or receive notices from customers or public or private agencies that they have detected actual or perceived vulnerabilities in our servers our software or thirdparty software components that are distributed with our products or fraudulent activity by unauthorized persons utilizing our products with stolen customer identity information the existence of such vulnerabilities or fraudulent activity even if they do not result in a security breach may undermine customer confidence as well as the confidence of government agencies that regulate our offerings such perceived vulnerabilities could also seriously harm our business by tarnishing our reputation and brand andor limiting the adoption of our products and services and could cause our stock price to decline 

a cybersecurity incident affecting the third parties we rely on could expose us or our customers to a risk of loss or misuse of confidential information and significantly damage our reputation 

we depend on a number of third parties including vendors developers and partners who are critical to our business we or our customers may grant access to customer data to these third parties to help deliver customer benefits or to host certain of our and our customers sensitive and personal data in addition we share sensitive nonpublic business information including for example materials relating to financial business and legal strategies with other vendors in the ordinary course of business 

while we conduct background checks of our workforce conduct reviews of partners developers and vendors and use commercially available technologies to limit access to systems and data it is possible that one or more of these individuals or third parties may misrepresent their intended use of data or may circumvent our controls resulting in accidental or intentional 



tables of contents 

disclosure or misuse of our customers’ or employees’ data further while we conduct due diligence on these third parties with respect to their security and business controls we may not have the ability to effectively monitor or oversee the implementation of these control measures individuals or third parties may be able to circumvent these security and business controls andor exploit vulnerabilities that may exist in these controls resulting in the disclosure or misuse of sensitive business and personal customer or employee information and data 

a security incident involving third parties whom we rely on may have serious negative consequences for our businesses including disclosure of sensitive customer or employee data or confidential or competitively sensitive information regarding our business including intellectual property and other proprietary data make our products more vulnerable to fraudulent activity cause temporary or sustained unavailability of our software and systems result in possible litigation fines penalties and damages result in loss of customer confidence cause material harm to our reputation and brands lead to further regulation and oversight by federal or state agencies cause adverse financial condition and result in a reduced stock price 

concerns about the current privacy and cybersecurity environment generally could deter current and potential customers from adopting our products and services and damage our reputation 

the continued occurrence of cyberattacks and data breaches on governments businesses and consumers in general indicates that we operate in an external environment where cyberattacks and data breaches are becoming increasingly common if the global cybersecurity environment worsens and there are increased instances of security breaches of thirdparty offerings where consumers’ data and sensitive information is compromised consumers may be less willing to use online offerings particularly offerings like ours in which customers often share sensitive financial data in addition the increased availability of data obtained as a result of breaches of thirdparty offerings could make our own products more vulnerable to fraudulent activity even if our products are not affected directly by such incidents any such incident could damage our reputation and deter current and potential customers from adopting our products and services or lead customers to cease using online and connected software products to transact financial business altogether 

if we are unable to effectively combat the increasing amount and sophistication of fraudulent activities by third parties using our offerings we may suffer losses which may be substantial and lose the confidence of our customers and government agencies and our revenues and earnings may be harmed 

the online tax preparation payroll administration and online payments industries have been experiencing an increasing amount of fraudulent activities by third parties and those fraudulent activities are becoming increasingly sophisticated although we do not believe that any of this activity is uniquely targeted at our products or business this type of fraudulent activity may adversely impact our tax payroll and payments businesses in addition to any losses that may result from such fraud which may be substantial a loss of confidence by our customers or by governmental agencies in our ability to prevent fraudulent activity that is perpetrated through our offerings may seriously harm our business and damage our brand if we cannot adequately combat such fraudulent activity that is perpetrated through our tax offerings governmental authorities may refuse to allow us to continue to offer such services which could include federal or state tax authorities refusing to allow us to process our customers’ tax returns electronically resulting in a significant adverse impact on our earnings and revenue as fraudulent activities become more pervasive and increasingly sophisticated and fraud detection and prevention measures must become correspondingly more complex to combat them across the various industries in which we operate we may implement risk control mechanisms that could make it more difficult for legitimate customers to obtain and use our products which could result in lost revenue and negatively impact our earnings 

if we fail to process transactions effectively or fail to adequately protect against disputed or potential fraudulent activities our business may be harmed 

our operations process a significant volume and dollar value of transactions on a daily basis especially in our payroll and payments businesses despite our efforts to ensure that effective processing systems and controls are in place to handle transactions appropriately it is possible that we may make errors or that funds may be misappropriated due to fraud the likelihood of any such error or misappropriation may increase as we accelerate the speed at which we process transactions the systems supporting our business are comprised of multiple technology platforms that are sometimes difficult to scale if we are unable to effectively manage our systems and processes or if there is an error in our products we may be unable to process customer data in an accurate reliable and timely manner which may harm our reputation the willingness of customers to use our products and our financial results in our payments processing service business if merchants for whom we process payment transactions are unable to pay refunds due to their customers in connection with disputed or fraudulent merchant transactions we may be required to pay those amounts and our payments may exceed the amount of the customer reserves we have established to make such payments 

business interruption or failure of our information technology and communication systems may impair the availability of our products and services which may damage our reputation and harm our future financial results 

our reputation and ability to attract retain and serve our customers is dependent upon the reliable performance of our products and our underlying technical infrastructure as we continue to grow our online services we become more dependent on the continuing operation and availability of our information technology and communications systems and those of our 



tables of contents 

external service providers including for example thirdparty internetbased or cloud computing services we do not have redundancy for all of our systems and our disaster recovery planning may not account for all eventualities we have designed a significant portion of our software and computer systems to utilize data processing and storage capabilities provided by public cloud providers such as amazon web services if any public cloud service that we use is unavailable to us for any reason our customers may not be able to access certain of our cloud products or features which could significantly impact our operations business and financial results 

failure of our systems or those of our thirdparty service providers may result in interruptions in our service and loss of data or processing capabilities all of which may cause a loss in customers refunds of product fees material harm to our reputation and operating results 

our tax businesses must effectively handle extremely heavy customer demand during critical peak periods from january until april of each year we face significant risks in maintaining adequate service levels during these peak periods when we derive a substantial portion of our overall revenue from the tax businesses any interruptions in our online tax preparation or electronic filing service at any time during the tax season particularly during a peak period could result in significantly decreased revenue lost customers unexpected refunds of customer charges negative publicity and increased operating costs any of which could significantly harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

we rely on internal systems and external systems maintained by manufacturers distributors and other service providers to take and fulfill customer orders handle customer service requests and host certain online activities any interruption or failure of our internal or external systems may prevent us or our service providers from accepting and fulfilling customer orders or cause company and customer data to be unintentionally disclosed our continuing efforts to upgrade and expand our network security and other information systems as well as our highavailability capabilities may be costly and problems with the design or implementation of system enhancements may harm our business and our results of operations 

our business operations data centers information technology and communications systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters human error malicious attacks fire power loss telecommunications failures computer viruses computer denial of service attacks terrorist attacks and other events beyond our control in addition our corporate headquarters and other critical business operations are located near major seismic faults in the event of a major natural or manmade disaster our insurance coverage may not completely compensate us for our losses and our future financial results may be materially harmed 

we regularly invest resources to update and improve our internal information technology systems and software platforms should our investments not succeed or if delays or other issues with new or existing internal technology systems and software platforms disrupt our operations our business could be harmed 

we rely on our network and data center infrastructure and internal technology systems for many of our development marketing operational support sales accounting and financial reporting activities we are continually investing resources to update and improve these systems and environments in order to meet existing needs as well as the growing and changing requirements of our business and customers if we experience prolonged delays or unforeseen difficulties in updating and upgrading our systems and architecture we may experience outages and may not be able to deliver certain offerings and develop new offerings and enhancements that we need to remain competitive such improvements and upgrades are often complex costly and time consuming in addition such improvements can be challenging to integrate with our existing technology systems or may uncover problems with our existing technology systems unsuccessful implementation of hardware or software updates and improvements could result in outages disruption in our business operations loss of revenue or damage to our reputation 

if we are unable to develop manage and maintain critical thirdparty business relationships our business may be adversely affected 

our growth is increasingly dependent on the strength of our business relationships and our ability to continue to develop manage and maintain new and existing relationships with thirdparty partners we rely on various thirdparty partners including software and service providers suppliers vendors manufacturers distributors accountants contractors financial institutions core processors licensing partners and development partners among others in many areas of our business in order to deliver our offerings and operate our business we also rely on third parties to support the operation of our business by maintaining our physical facilities equipment power systems and infrastructure in certain instances these thirdparty relationships are sole source or limited source relationships and can be difficult to replace or substitute depending on the level of integration of the third party’s products or services into or with our offerings andor the general availability of such third party’s products and services in addition there may be few or no alternative thirdparty providers or vendors in the market further there can be no assurance that we will be able to adequately retain thirdparty contractors engaged to help us operate our business the failure of third parties to provide acceptable and high quality products services and technologies or to update their products services and technologies may result in a disruption to our business operations and our customers which may reduce our revenues and profits cause us to lose customers and damage our reputation alternative arrangements and services may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all or we may experience business interruptions upon a transition to an alternative partner 



tables of contents 

although we have strict standards for our suppliers and business partners to comply with the law and company policies regarding workplace and employment practices data use and security environmental compliance intellectual property licensing and other applicable regulatory and compliance requirements we cannot control their daytoday practices if any of them violate laws or implement practices regarded as unethical we could experience supply chain disruptions canceled orders terminations of or damage to key relationships and damage to our reputation 

in particular we have relationships with banks credit unions and other financial institutions that support certain critical services we offer to our customers if macroeconomic conditions or other factors cause any of these institutions to fail consolidate stop providing certain services or institute costcutting efforts our business and financial results may suffer and we may be unable to offer those services to our customers 

we increasingly utilize the distribution platforms of third parties like apple’s app store and google’s play store for the distribution of certain of our product offerings although we benefit from the strong brand recognition and large user base of these distribution platforms to attract new customers the platform owners have wide discretion to change the pricing structure terms of service and other policies with respect to us and other developers any adverse changes by these third parties could adversely affect our financial results 

because competition for our key employees is intense we may not be able to attract retain and develop the highly skilled employees we need to support our planned growth 

much of our future success depends on the continued service and availability of skilled personnel including members of our executive team and those in technical and other key positions experienced personnel in the software mobile technologies data science data security and software as a service industries are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense especially in california and india where the majority of our employees are located also as we strive to continue to adapt to technological change and introduce new and enhanced products and business models we must be able to secure maintain and develop the right quality and quantity of engaged and committed talent the incentives we have available to attract retain and motivate employees provided by our equity awards may become less effective and if we were to issue significant equity to attract additional employees the ownership of our existing stockholders would be diluted although we strive to be an employer of choice we may not be able to continue to successfully attract retain and develop key personnel which may cause our business to suffer 

if we experience significant product accuracy or quality problems or delays in product launches it may harm our revenue earnings and reputation 

all of our tax products and many of our nontax products have rigid development timetables that increase the risk of errors in our products and the risk of launch delays our tax preparation software product development cycle is particularly challenging due to the need to incorporate unpredictable and potentially late tax law and tax form changes each year and because our customers expect high levels of accuracy and a timely launch of these products to prepare and file their taxes by the tax filing deadline due to the complexity of our products and the condensed development cycles under which we operate our products may contain errors that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the software or result in incorrect calculations the complexity of the tax laws on which our products are based may also make it difficult for us to consistently deliver offerings that contain the features functionality and level of accuracy that our customers expect when we encounter problems we may be required to modify our code work with state tax administrators to communicate with affected customers assist customers with amendments distribute patches to customers who have already purchased the product and recall or repackage existing product inventory in our distribution channels if we encounter development challenges or discover errors in our products either late in our development cycle or after release it may cause us to delay our product launch date or suspend product availability until such issues can be fixed any major defects launch delays or product suspensions may lead to loss of customers and revenue negative publicity customer and employee dissatisfaction reduced retailer shelf space and promotions and increased operating expenses such as inventory replacement costs legal fees or other payments including those resulting from our accuracy guarantee in our tax preparation products for example an error in our tax products could cause a compliance error for taxpayers including the over or underpayment of their federal or state tax liability while our accuracy guarantee commits us to reimburse penalties and interest paid by customers due solely to calculation errors in our tax preparation products such errors may result in additional burdens on third parties that we may need to address or that may cause us to suspend the availability of our products until such errors are addressed this could also affect our reputation the willingness of customers to use our products and our financial results further as we develop our platform to connect people to experts such as connecting turbotax customers with tax experts through our turbotax live offering or connecting quickbooks customers with bookkeepers through our quickbooks live offering we face the risk that these experts may provide advice that is erroneous ineffective or otherwise unsuitable any such deficiency in the advice given by these experts may cause harm to our customers a loss of customer confidence in our offerings or harm to our reputation or financial results 

our international operations are subject to increased risks which may harm our business operating results and financial condition 

in addition to uncertainty about our ability to generate revenues from our foreign operations and expand into international markets there are risks inherent in doing business internationally including 



tables of contents 

 violations of the rapidly evolving and complex foreign and us laws and regulations that apply to our international operations may result in fines criminal actions or sanctions against us our officers or our employees prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with these laws there can be no assurance that our employees contractors or agents will not violate our policies these risks inherent in our international operations and expansion increase our costs of doing business internationally and may result in harm to our business operating results and financial condition 

legal and compliance risks 

legal and compliance risks arise from change in the government and regulatory environment including complex and evolving regulations relating privacy and data security potential litigation regulatory inquiries and intellectual property infringement claims 

increased government regulation of our businesses or changes to existing regulations may harm our operating results 

the company is subject to federal state local and international laws and regulations that affect the company’s activities including without limitation areas of labor advertising tax financial services data privacy and security electronic funds transfer money transmission lending digital content consumer protection real estate billing ecommerce promotions quality of services intellectual property ownership and infringement import and export requirements anticorruption foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions anticompetition environmental health and safety and other regulated activities there have been significant new regulations and heightened focus by the government on many of these areas as well as in areas such as insurance and privacy a s we expand our products and services and revise our business models both domestically and internationally we may become subject to additional government regulation or increased regulatory scrutiny further regulators both in the us and in other jurisdictions in which we operate may adopt new laws or regulations change existing regulations or their interpretation of existing laws or regulations may differ from ours 

the tax preparation industry continues to receive heightened attention from federal and state governments new legislation regulation public policy considerations changes in the cybersecurity environment litigation by the government or private entities changes to or new interpretations of existing laws may result in greater oversight of the tax preparation industry restrict the types of products and services that we can offer or the prices we can charge or otherwise cause us to change the way we operate our tax businesses or offer our tax products and services we may not be able to respond quickly to such regulatory legislative and other developments and these changes may in turn increase our cost of doing business and limit our revenue opportunities in addition if our practices are not consistent with new interpretations of existing laws we may become subject to lawsuits penalties and other liabilities that did not previously apply we are also required to comply with a variety of state revenue agency standards in order to successfully operate our tax preparation and electronic filing services 

changes in stateimposed requirements by one or more of the states including the required use of specific technologies or technology standards may significantly increase the costs of providing those services to our customers and may prevent us from delivering a quality product to our customers in a timely manner 



tables of contents 

complex and evolving us and international laws and regulation regarding privacy and data protection could result in claims changes to our business practices penalties increased cost of operations or otherwise harm our business 

regulations related to the provision of online services is evolving as federal state and foreign governments continue to adopt new or modify existing laws and regulations addressing data privacy and the collection processing storage transfer and use of data this includes for example the eus new regulation the general data protection regulation gdpr and the new california consumer protection act ccpa which will become effective on january 1 2020 in our efforts to meet the gdpr ccpa and other data privacy regulations we have made and continue to make certain operational changes to our products and business practices if we are unable to engineer products that meet these evolving requirements or help our customers meet their obligations under these or other new data regulations we might experience reduced demand for our offerings further penalties for noncompliance with these laws may be significant 

in addition there are global privacy treaties and frameworks that have created compliance uncertainty and increased complexity for example the european commission and the swiss government approved the euus and swissus privacy shield frameworks respectively that provide a mechanism for companies to legally transfer personal data from the eu and switzerland to the us however these frameworks as well as other personal data transfer mechanisms face a number of legal challenges both by regulators and private parties a change in these transfer mechanisms could cause us to incur costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business 

other governmental authorities throughout the us and around the world are considering similar types of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection each of these privacy security and data protection laws and regulations could impose significant limitations require changes to our business require notification to customers or workers of a security breach restrict our use or storage of personal information or cause changes in customer purchasing behavior which may make our business more costly less efficient or impossible to conduct and may require us to modify our current or future products or services which may make customers less likely to purchase our products and may harm our future financial results additionally any actual or alleged noncompliance with these laws and regulations could result in negative publicity and subject us to investigations claims or other remedies including demands that we modify or cease existing business practices and expose us to significant fines penalties and other damages we have incurred and may continue to incur significant expenses to comply with existing privacy and security standards and protocols imposed by law regulation industry standards or contractual obligations 

we are frequently a party to litigation and regulatory inquiries which could result in an unfavorable outcome and have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operation and cash flows 

we are subject to various legal proceedings including class action lawsuits claims and regulatory inquiries that have arisen out of the ordinary conduct of our business and are not yet resolved and additional claims and inquiries may arise in the future the number and significance of these claims and inquiries may increase as our businesses evolve any proceedings claims or inquiries initiated by or against us whether successful or not may be time consuming result in costly litigation damage awards consent decrees injunctive relief or increased costs of business require us to change our business practices or products require significant amounts of management time result in diversion of significant operations resources or otherwise harm our business and future financial results for further information about specific litigation see item 3 “legal proceedings” 

third parties claiming that we infringe their proprietary rights may cause us to incur significant legal expenses and prevent us from selling our products 

we may become increasingly subject to infringement claims including patent copyright trade secret and trademark infringement claims litigation may be necessary to determine the validity and scope of the intellectual property rights of others we have received a number of allegations of intellectual property infringement claims in the past and expect to receive more claims in the future based on allegations that our offerings infringe upon the intellectual property held by third parties some of these claims are the subject of pending litigation against us and against some of our customers these claims may involve patent holding companies or other adverse intellectual property owners who have no relevant product revenues of their own and against whom our own intellectual property may provide little or no deterrence the ultimate outcome of any allegation is uncertain and regardless of outcome any such claim with or without merit may be time consuming to defend result in costly litigation divert management’s time and attention from our business require us to stop selling delay shipping or redesign our products or require us to pay monetary damages for royalty or licensing fees or to satisfy indemnification obligations that we have with some of our customers our failure to obtain necessary license or other rights or litigation arising out of intellectual property claims may harm our business 

we are subject to risks associated with information disseminated through our services 

the laws relating to the liability of online services companies for information such as online content disseminated through their services are subject to frequent challenges in spite of settled law in the us claims are made against online services companies by parties who disagree with the content where our online content is accessed on the internet outside of the us challenges may be brought under foreign laws which do not provide the same protections for online services companies as in the us these challenges in either us or foreign jurisdictions may give rise to legal claims alleging defamation libel invasion 



tables of contents 

of privacy negligence copyright or trademark infringement or other theories based on the nature and content of the materials disseminated through the services certain of our services include content generated by users of our online services although this content is not generated by us claims of defamation or other injury may be made against us for that content any costs incurred as a result of this potential liability may harm our business 

financial risks 

financial risks relate to our ability to meet financial obligations and mitigate exposure to financial impacts to our businesses or our offerings financial risks arise from the following seasonality excessive subscription cancellations and product returns unanticipated changes in income tax rates adverse global macroeconomic conditions credit risks fluctuations in our net income indebtedness and the fluctuation of our stock price 

our tax business is highly seasonal and our quarterly results could fluctuate significantly 

our tax offerings have significant seasonal patterns revenue from income tax preparation products and services is heavily concentrated during november through april this seasonality has caused significant fluctuations in our quarterly financial results our financial results may also fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year due to a variety of factors including factors that may affect the timing of revenue recognition these include changes to our offerings that result in the inclusion or exclusion of ongoing services changes in product pricing strategies or product sales mix the timing of the availability of federal and state tax forms from taxing agencies and the ability of those agencies to receive electronic tax return submissions changes in customer behavior and the timing of our discontinuation of support for older product offerings other factors that may affect our quarterly or annual financial results include the timing of acquisitions divestitures and goodwill and acquired intangible asset impairment charges any fluctuations in our operating results may adversely affect our stock price 

if actual customer refunds for our offerings exceed the amount we have reserved our future financial results may be harmed 

like many software companies we refund customers for product returns and subscription cancellations we establish reserves against revenue in our financial statements based on estimated customer refunds we closely monitor this refund activity in an effort to maintain adequate reserves in the past customer refunds have not differed significantly from these reserves however if we experience actual customer refunds that significantly exceed the amount we have reserved it may result in lower net revenue 

unanticipated changes in our income tax rates or other indirect tax may affect our future financial results 

our future effective income tax rates may be favorably or unfavorably affected by unanticipated changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities by changes in our stock price or by changes in tax laws or their interpretation foreign governments may enact tax laws that could result in further changes to global taxation and materially affect our financial position and results of operations in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes these continuous examinations may result in unforeseen taxrelated liabilities which may harm our future financial results 

an increasing number of states and foreign jurisdictions have adopted laws or administrative practices that impose new taxes on all or a portion of gross revenue or other similar amounts or impose additional obligations to collect transaction taxes such as sales consumption value added or similar taxes we may not have sufficient lead time to build systems and processes to collect these taxes properly or at all failure to comply with such laws or administrative practices or a successful assertion by such states or foreign jurisdictions requiring us to collect taxes where we do not could result in tax liabilities including for past sales as well as penalties and interest 

adverse global economic conditions could harm our business and financial condition 

adverse macroeconomic developments could negatively affect our business and financial condition adverse global economic events have caused and could in the future cause disruptions and volatility in global financial markets and increased rates of default and bankruptcy and could impact consumer and small business spending while we have historically performed well in economic downturns there is no guarantee that we would continue to perform well in future adverse macroeconomic conditions in particular because the majority of our revenue is derived from sales within the us economic conditions in the us have an even greater impact on us than companies with a more diverse international presence challenging economic times could cause potential new customers not to purchase or to delay purchasing our products and services and could cause our existing customers to discontinue purchasing or delay upgrades of our existing products and services thereby negatively impacting our revenues and future financial results decreased consumer spending levels could also reduce credit and debit card transaction processing volumes causing reductions in our payments revenue poor economic conditions and high unemployment have caused and could in the future cause a significant decrease in the number of tax returns filed which may have a significant effect on the number of tax returns we prepare and file in addition weakness in the enduser consumer and small business markets could negatively affect the cash flow of our distributors and resellers who could in turn delay paying 



tables of contents 

their obligations to us which could increase our credit risk exposure and cause delays in our recognition of revenue or future sales to these customers any of these events could harm our business and our future financial results 

we provide capital to small businesses which exposes us to certain risk and may cause us material financial or reputational harm 

we provide capital to qualified small businesses which exposes us to the risk of our borrowers’ inability to repay such loans we have also entered into credit arrangements with financial institutions to obtain the capital we provide under this offering any termination or interruption in the financial institutions’ ability to lend to us could interrupt our ability to provide capital to qualified small businesses further our credit decisioning pricing loss forecasting and scoring models used to evaluate loan applications may contain errors or may not adequately assess creditworthiness of our borrowers or may be otherwise ineffective resulting in incorrect approvals or denials of loans it is also possible that loan applicants could provide false or incorrect information while we have not incurred any material losses to date if any of the foregoing events were to occur our reputation and relationships with borrowers and our financial results could be harmed 

amortization of acquired intangible assets and impairment charges may cause significant fluctuation in our net income 

our acquisitions have resulted in significant expenses including amortization and impairment of acquired technology and other acquired intangible assets and impairment of goodwill total costs and expenses in these categories were 26 million in fiscal 2019 21 million in fiscal 2018 and 14 million in fiscal 2017 although under current accounting rules goodwill is not amortized we may incur impairment charges related to the goodwill already recorded and to goodwill arising out of future acquisitions we test the impairment of goodwill annually in our fourth fiscal quarter or more frequently if indicators of impairment arise the timing of the formal annual test may result in charges to our statement of operations in our fourth fiscal quarter that may not have been reasonably foreseen in prior periods at july 31 2019  we had 17 billion in goodwill and 54 million in net acquired intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheet both of which may be subject to impairment charges in the future new acquisitions and any impairment of the value of acquired intangible assets may have a significant negative impact on our future financial results 

we have incurred indebtedness and may incur other debt in the future which may adversely affect our financial condition and future financial results 

as of july 31 2019  we had an aggregate of 436 million of indebtedness outstanding under our credit facilities we may incur additional debt in the future 

this debt may adversely affect our financial condition and future financial results by among other things 

 our current unsecured and secured revolving credit facilities impose restrictions on us including restrictions on our ability to create liens on our assets and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur indebtedness and require us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios our ability to comply with these ratios may be affected by events beyond our control in addition our short and longterm debt includes covenants that may adversely affect our ability to incur certain liens or engage in certain types of sale and leaseback transactions if we breach any of the covenants under our short and longterm debt or our unsecured revolving credit facility and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders then subject to applicable cure periods any outstanding indebtedness may be declared immediately due and payable 

in addition changes by any rating agency to our credit rating may negatively impact the value and liquidity of both our debt and equity securities if our credit ratings are downgraded or other negative action is taken the interest rate payable by us under our unsecured revolving credit facility or our secured term loan may increase in addition any downgrades in our credit ratings may affect our ability to obtain additional financing in the future and may affect the terms of any such financing 

we cannot guarantee that our share repurchase program will be fully consummated or that it will enhance longterm stockholder value 

we have a stock repurchase program under which we are authorized to repurchase our common stock the repurchase programs do not have an expiration date and we are not obligated to repurchase a specified number or dollar value of shares our repurchase programs may be suspended or terminated at any time and even if fully implemented may not enhance longterm stockholder value also the amount timing and execution of our stock repurchase programs may fluctuate based on our priorities for the use of cash for other purposes and because of changes in cash flows tax laws and the market price of our common stock

in fiscal 2015 intuit was contacted by certain state and federal regulatory authorities in connection with inquiries regarding an increase during the 2015 tax season in attempts by criminals using stolen identity information to file fraudulent tax returns and claim refunds intuit provided information in response to those inquiries and now believes those inquiries are resolved a consolidated putative class action lawsuit was filed by individuals who claim to have suffered damages in connection with the 2015 events on may 23 2018 the parties reached a settlement in principle of this matter the settlement was granted final approval and the matter was dismissed with prejudice by the court on may 15 2019 the terms of the settlement are not material to our consolidated financial statements 

beginning in may 2019 various lawsuits were filed and certain regulatory inquiries were commenced in connection with our provision and marketing of free online tax preparation programs we believe that the allegations contained within these lawsuits are without merit we intend to vigorously defend against the lawsuits and cooperate in the investigations 

intuit is subject to certain routine legal proceedings including class action lawsuits as well as demands claims government inquiries and threatened litigation that arise in the normal course of our business including assertions that we may be infringing patents or other intellectual property rights of others our failure to obtain necessary license or other rights or litigation arising out of intellectual property claims could adversely affect our business we currently believe that in addition to any amounts accrued the amount of potential losses if any for any pending claims of any type either alone or combined will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements the ultimate outcome of any litigation is uncertain and

you should note that this mda contains forwardlooking statements that involve risks and uncertainties please see the section entitled “forwardlooking statements” immediately preceding part i for important information to consider when evaluating such statements 

you should read this mda in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes in item 8 of this annual report 

effective august 1 2018 we adopted the requirements of accounting standards update asu 201409 “ revenue from contracts with customers topic 606 ” and asu 201618 “ statement of cash flows topic 230 restricted cash ” all prior period amounts have been restated to comply with these standards see note 1 in item 8 of this annual report for more information

this overview provides a high level discussion of our operating results and some of the trends that affect our business we believe that an understanding of these trends is important in order to understand our financial results for fiscal 2019 as well as our future prospects this summary is not intended to be exhaustive nor is it a substitute for the detailed discussion and analysis provided elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 



industry trends 

ai is transforming multiple industries including financial technology disruptive startups emerging ecosystems and megaplatforms are harnessing new technology to create personalized experiences deliver datadriven insights and increase speed of service these shifts are creating a more dynamic and highly competitive environment where customer expectations are shifting around the world as more services become digitized and the array of choices continues to increase 

seasonality 

our consumer and strategic partner offerings have a significant and distinct seasonal pattern as sales and revenue from our income tax preparation products and services are heavily concentrated in the period from november through april this seasonal pattern results in higher net revenues during our second and third quarters ending january 31 and april 30 respectively we expect the seasonality of our consumer and strategic partner businesses to continue to have a significant impact on our quarterly financial results in the future 



tables of contents 



our growth strategy depends upon our ability to initiate and embrace disruptive technology trends to enter new markets and to drive broad adoption of the products and services we develop and market our future growth also increasingly depends on the strength of our thirdparty business relationships and our ability to continue to develop maintain and strengthen new and existing relationships to remain competitive and continue to grow we are investing significant resources in our product development marketing and sales capabilities and we expect to continue to do so in the future 

as we offer more online services the ongoing operation and availability of our platforms and systems and those of our external service providers is becoming increasingly important because we help customers manage their financial lives we face risks associated with the hosting collection use and retention of personal customer information and data we are investing significant management attention and resources in our information technology infrastructure and in our privacy and security capabilities and we expect to continue to do so in the future 

for our consumer and professional tax offerings we have implemented additional security measures and are continuing to work with state and federal governments to share information regarding suspicious filings we continue to invest in security measures and to work with the broader industry and government to protect our customers against this type of fraud 

for a complete discussion of the most significant risks and uncertainties affecting our business please see “forwardlooking statements” immediately preceding part i and “risk factors” in item 1a of part i of this report 



the most important financial indicators that we use to assess our business are revenue growth for the company as a whole and for each reportable segment operating income growth for the company as a whole  earnings per share and cash flow from operations we also track certain nonfinancial drivers of revenue growth and when material identify them in the applicable discussions of segment results below these nonfinancial drivers include for example customer growth and retention for all of our businesses service offerings are a significant part of our business our total service and other revenue was 52 billion or 76 of our total revenue in fiscal 2019 and we expect our total service and other revenue to continue to grow in the future 

key highlights for fiscal 2019 include the following 





tables of contents 



in preparing our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap we are required to make estimates assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on our net revenue operating income or loss and net income or loss as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets we believe that the estimates assumptions and judgments involved in the following accounting policies have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies 

 our senior management has reviewed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and their disclosure in this annual report on form 10k with the audit and risk committee of our board of directors 

revenue recognition 

we derive our revenue primarily from the sale of packaged desktop software products desktop software subscriptions and online services such as tax accounting payroll and merchant payment processing our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services in determining how revenue should be recognized a fivestep process is used which requires judgment and estimates within the revenue recognition process the primary judgments include identifying the performance obligations in the contract and determining whether the performance obligations are distinct if any of these judgments were to change it could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue we report in a particular period for additional information see “revenue recognition” in note 1 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report 

business combinations 

as described in “description of business and summary of significant accounting policies – business combinations” in note 1 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report under the acquisition method of accounting we generally recognize the identifiable assets acquired the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interests in an acquiree at their fair values as of the date of acquisition we measure goodwill as the excess of consideration transferred which we also measure at fair value over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed the acquisition method of accounting requires us to exercise judgment and make significant estimates and assumptions regarding the fair values of the elements of a business combination as of the date of acquisition including the fair values of identifiable intangible assets deferred tax asset valuation allowances liabilities related to uncertain tax positions and contingencies this method also requires us to refine these estimates over a oneyear measurement period to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that if known would have affected the measurement of the amounts recognized as of that date if we are required to retroactively adjust provisional amounts that we have recorded for the fair values of assets and liabilities in connection with acquisitions these adjustments could materially decrease our operating income and net income and result in lower asset values on our consolidated balance sheet 

significant estimates and assumptions that we must make in estimating the fair value of acquired technology customer lists and other identifiable intangible assets include future cash flows that we expect to generate from the acquired assets if the subsequent actual results and updated projections of the underlying business activity change compared with the assumptions and projections used to develop these values we could record impairment charges in addition we have estimated the economic lives of certain acquired assets and these lives are used to calculate depreciation and amortization expense if our estimates of the economic lives change depreciation or amortization expenses could be accelerated or slowed 

goodwill acquired intangible assets and other longlived assets – impairment assessments 

we estimate the fair value of acquired intangible assets and other longlived assets that have finite useful lives whenever an event or change in circumstances indicates that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable we test for potential impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives annually in our fourth fiscal quarter or whenever indicators of impairment arise the timing of the annual test may result in charges to our consolidated statement of operations in our fourth fiscal quarter that could not have been reasonably foreseen in prior periods 

as described in “description of business and summary of significant accounting policies – goodwill acquired intangible assets and other longlived assets” in note 1 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report in order to estimate the fair value of goodwill we use a weighted combination of a discounted cash flow model known as the income 



tables of contents 

approach and comparisons to publicly traded companies engaged in similar businesses known as the market approach the income approach requires us to use a number of assumptions including market factors specific to the business the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows to be generated by the business over an extended period of time longterm growth rates for the business and a rate of return that considers the relative risk of achieving the cash flows and the time value of money we evaluate cash flows at the reporting unit level although the assumptions we use in our discounted cash flow model are consistent with the assumptions we use to generate our internal strategic plans and forecasts significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of future cash flows from each reporting unit and the relative risk of achieving those cash flows when using the market approach we make judgments about the comparability of publicly traded companies engaged in similar businesses we base our judgments on factors such as size growth rates profitability risk and return on investment we also make judgments when adjusting market multiples of revenue operating income and earnings for these companies to reflect their relative similarity to our own businesses see note 5 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report for a summary of goodwill by reportable segment 

we estimate the recoverability of acquired intangible assets and other longlived assets that have finite useful lives by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows that we expect the asset to generate in order to estimate the fair value of those assets we estimate the present value of future cash flows from those assets the key assumptions that we use in our discounted cash flow model are the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows to be generated by the asset over an extended period of time and a rate of return that considers the relative risk of achieving the cash flows and the time value of money significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of future cash flows and the relative risk of achieving those cash flows we also make judgments about the remaining useful lives of acquired intangible assets and other longlived assets that have finite lives see note 5 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report for a summary of cost accumulated amortization and weighted average life in years for our acquired intangible assets 

assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives are complex and often subjective they can be affected by a variety of factors including external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts for example if our future operating results do not meet current forecasts or if we experience a sustained decline in our market capitalization that is determined to be indicative of a reduction in fair value of one or more of our reporting units we may be required to record future impairment charges for goodwill and acquired intangible assets impairment charges could materially decrease our future net income and result in lower asset values on our consolidated balance sheet 

during the fourth quarters of fiscal 2019  fiscal 2018  and fiscal 2017 we performed our annual goodwill impairment tests using the methodology described in “description of business and summary of significant accounting policies – goodwill acquired intangible assets and other longlived assets” in note 1 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report we determined that the estimated fair values of all of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values and that they were not impaired in addition during this analysis we concluded that the estimated fair values of all of our reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying values 

accounting for sharebased compensation plans 

restricted stock units rsus granted typically vest based on continued service we value these timebased rsus at the date of grant using the intrinsic value method we amortize the fair value of timebased rsus on a straightline basis over the service period certain rsus granted to senior management vest based on the achievement of preestablished performance or market goals we estimate the fair value of performancebased rsus at the date of grant using the intrinsic value method and the probability that the specified performance criteria will be met each quarter we update our assessment of the probability that the specified performance criteria will be achieved and adjust our estimate of the fair value of the performancebased rsus if necessary we amortize the fair values of performancebased rsus over the requisite service period for each separately vesting tranche of the award we estimate the fair value of marketbased rsus at the date of grant using a monte carlo valuation methodology and amortize those fair values over the requisite service period for each separately vesting tranche of the award the monte carlo methodology that we use to estimate the fair value of marketbased rsus at the date of grant incorporates into the valuation the possibility that the market condition may not be satisfied provided that the requisite service is rendered the total fair value of the marketbased rsus at the date of grant must be recognized as compensation expense even if the market condition is not achieved however the number of shares that ultimately vest can vary significantly with the performance of the specified market criteria all of the rsus we grant have dividend rights that are subject to the same vesting requirements as the underlying equity awards so we do not adjust the intrinsic market value of our rsus for dividends 

we use a lattice binomial model and the assumptions described in note 10 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report to estimate the fair value of stock options granted we estimate the expected term of options granted based on implied exercise patterns using a binomial model we estimate the volatility of our common stock at the date of grant based on the implied volatility of publicly traded oneyear and twoyear options on our common stock our decision to use implied volatility is based upon the availability of actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility we base the riskfree interest rate that we use in our option valuation model on the implied yield in effect at the time of option grant on constant maturity us treasury issues with equivalent remaining terms we use an annualized expected dividend yield in our option valuation model we adjust sharebased compensation expense for actual forfeitures as they occur we amortize the fair value of options on a

straightline basis over the requisite service periods of the awards which are generally the vesting periods we may elect to use different assumptions under our option valuation model in the future which could materially affect our net income or loss and net income or loss per share see note 10 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report for more information 

legal contingencies 

we are subject to certain legal proceedings as well as demands claims and threatened litigation that arise in the normal course of our business we review the status of each significant matter quarterly and assess our potential financial exposure if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated we record a liability and an expense for the estimated loss if we determine that a loss is possible and the range of the loss can be reasonably determined then we disclose the range of the possible loss significant judgment is required in the determination of whether a potential loss is probable reasonably possible or remote as well as in the determination of whether a potential exposure is reasonably estimable our accruals are based on the best information available at the time as additional information becomes available we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates potential legal liabilities and the revision of estimates of potential legal liabilities could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations see note 12 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report for more information 

accounting for income taxes – estimates of deferred taxes valuation allowances and uncertain tax positions 

we estimate our income taxes based on the various jurisdictions where we conduct business significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax rules and the potential for future adjustment of our uncertain tax positions by the united states internal revenue service or other taxing jurisdictions we estimate our current tax liability and assess temporary differences that result from differing treatments of certain items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which we show on our consolidated balance sheet we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized to the extent we believe that realization is not likely we establish a valuation allowance when we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in an accounting period we record a corresponding tax expense in our consolidated statement of operations 

we record a valuation allowance to reflect uncertainties about whether we will be able to utilize our deferred tax assets before they expire we assess the need for an adjustment to the valuation allowance on a quarterly basis the assessment is based on our estimates of future sources of taxable income in the jurisdictions in which we operate and the periods over which our deferred tax assets will be realizable while we have considered future taxable income in assessing the need for a valuation allowance for the periods presented we could in the future be required to increase the valuation allowance to take into account additional deferred tax assets that we may be unable to realize an increase in the valuation allowance could have an adverse impact on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which we record the change 

we recognize and measure benefits for uncertain tax positions using a twostep approach the first step is to evaluate the tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon audit including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes for tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely of being realized upon settlement significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions we evaluate our uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis our evaluations are based upon a number of factors including changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law correspondence with tax authorities during the course of audits and effective settlement of audit issues changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in material increases or decreases in our income tax expense in the period in which we make the change which could have a material impact on our effective tax rate and operating results see note 9 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report for more information

the 2017 tax act was enacted on december 22 2017 and reduced the us statutory federal corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 the effective date of the tax rate change was january 1 2018 the change resulted in a blended lower us statutory federal rate of 269 for fiscal year 2018 in fiscal 2019 we fully benefited from the enacted lower tax rate of 21 

we recorded a provisional benefit of 29 million for fiscal 2018 related to the remeasurement of certain deferred tax balances as the result of the 2017 tax act in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 we completed our accounting for the income tax effects of the 2017 tax act and there have been no material adjustments during the fiscal 2019 period 

our effective tax rates for fiscal 2019  fiscal 2018  and fiscal 2017 were approximately 17  15  and 29  excluding the tax benefits related to sharebased compensation our effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 was approximately 24 this differed from the federal statutory rate of 21 primarily due to state income taxes and nondeductible sharebased compensation which were partially offset by the benefit we received from the federal research and experimentation credit excluding the tax benefits related to sharebased compensation the reorganization of a subsidiary and the benefit related to the remeasurement of certain deferred tax balances our effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 was approximately 26 and did not differ significantly from the federal statutory rate of 269 excluding the tax benefits related to sharebased compensation our effective tax rate for fiscal 2017 was approximately 34 and did not differ significantly from the federal statutory rate of 35 see note 9 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report for more information about our effective tax rates

 item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend

investment portfolio and interest rate risk 

we actively monitor market conditions and developments specific to the securities in which we invest we believe that we take a conservative approach to investing our funds in that we invest only in highlyrated securities and diversify our portfolio of investments while we believe we take prudent measures to mitigate investmentrelated risks such risks cannot be fully eliminated because of market circumstances that are outside our control 

our investments consist of instruments that meet quality standards that are consistent with our investment policy this policy specifies that except for direct obligations of the united states government securities issued by agencies of the united states government and money market funds we diversify our investments by limiting our holdings with any individual issuer we do not hold derivative financial instruments or european sovereign debt in our portfolio of investments see note 2 and note 3 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report for a summary of the amortized cost and fair value of our investments by type of issue 

our cash equivalents and investments are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates interest rate movements affect the interest income we earn on cash equivalents and investments and the value of those investments at july 31 2019  our cash equivalents and investments totaled 25 billion and had a weighted average pretax yield of 257  total interest income for fiscal 2019 was 46 million  if the federal reserve target rate had increased by 25 basis points from the level of july 31 2019  the value of our investments at that date would have decreased by approximately 2 million if the federal reserve target rate had increased by 100 basis points from the level of july 31 2019  the value of our investments at that date would have decreased by approximately 8 million 

we are also exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates as they affect our 1 billion unsecured revolving credit facility400 million unsecured term loan and 300 million secured revolving credit facility advances under the unsecured revolving credit facility accrue interest at rates that are equal to bank of america’s alternate base rate plus a margin that ranges from 00 to 01 or the london interbank offered rate libor plus a margin that ranges from 069 to 11 the term loan accrues interest at rates that are equal to at our election either bank of americas alternate base rate plus a margin that ranges from 00 to 0125 or libor plus a margin that ranges from 0625 to 1125 actual margins under all of these elections are based on our senior debt credit ratings advances under the secured revolving credit facility accrue interest at a rate of libor plus 239  consequently our interest expense fluctuates with changes in the general level of these interest rates at july 31 2019 no amounts were outstanding under the unsecured revolving credit facility 388 million was outstanding under the term loan and 48 million was outstanding under the secured revolving credit facility see note 7 and note 8 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report for more information 

impact of foreign currency rate changes 

the functional currencies of our international operating subsidiaries are generally the local currencies we translate the assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries at the exchange rates in effect on the balance sheet date we translate their revenue costs and expenses at the average rates of exchange in effect during the period we include translation gains and losses in the stockholders’ equity section of our consolidated balance sheets we include net gains and losses resulting from foreign exchange transactions in interest and other income in our consolidated statements of operations 

since we translate foreign currencies primarily canadian dollars indian rupees and british pounds into us dollars for financial reporting purposes currency fluctuations can have an impact on our financial results the historical impact of currency fluctuations on our financial results has generally been immaterial we believe that our exposure to currency exchange fluctuation risk is not significant because our global subsidiaries invoice customers and satisfy their financial obligations almost exclusively in their local currencies we believe the impact of currency fluctuations will continue to not be significant in the foreseeable future due to the reasons cited above as of july 31 2019  we did not engage in foreign currency hedging activities

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in exchange act rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of july 31 2019 based on the guidelines established in internal control – integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso based on the results of this evaluation our management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of july 31 2019 to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles we reviewed the results of management’s assessment with the audit and risk committee of intuit’s board of directors 

ernst  young llp an independent registered public accounting firm has audited the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of july 31 2019  their report is included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

during our most recent fiscal quarter there has not occurred any change in our internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls 

our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer believes that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and that they are effective at the reasonable assurance level however no matter how well conceived and executed a control system can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met the design of any control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs there are also limitations that are inherent in any control system these limitations include the realities that breakdowns can occur because of errors in judgment or mistakes and that controls can be circumvented by individual persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls because of these inherent limitations in a cost effective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected

since the markets for software and related services are characterized by rapid technological change shifting customer needs and frequent new product introductions and enhancements a continuous high level of investment is required to innovate and quickly develop new products and services as well as enhance existing offerings our product development efforts are becoming more important than ever as we pursue our growth strategy 

we develop many of our products and services internally and we have a number of united states and foreign patents and pending applications that relate to various aspects of our products and technology we also supplement our internal development efforts by acquiring or licensing products and technology from third parties and establishing other relationships that enable us to enhance or expand our offerings more rapidly we expect to expand our thirdparty technology relationships as we continue to pursue our growth strategy 



tables of contents 

while our traditional desktop software products – quickbooks turbotax lacerte and proseries – tend to have predictable annual development and product release cycles as we move to more online offerings and mobile applications the development cycles are becoming more rapid in addition developing consumer and professional tax software and services presents unique challenges because of the demanding development cycle required to accurately incorporate federal and state tax law and tax form changes within a rigid timetable the development timing for our small business payroll and merchant payment processing services offerings varies with business needs and regulatory requirements and the length of the development cycle depends on the scope and complexity of each project 

we continue to make substantial investments in research and development and we expect to focus our future research and development efforts on enhancing existing products and services with financial recommendations personalization and ease of use enabled by artificial intelligence and machine learning we continue to focus on developing new products and services including new mobile and global offerings and significant research and development efforts on ongoing projects to update the technology platforms for several of our offerings our research and development expenses were 12 billion or 20 of total net revenue in fiscal 2018  998 million or 19 of total net revenue in fiscal 2017  and 881 million or 19 of total net revenue in fiscal 2016  



our consumer offerings have significant seasonal patterns as a result during each of the last three fiscal years the total consolidated revenue for our third quarter ended april 30 has represented nearly half of our annual total consolidated revenue for those years we expect the seasonality of our consumer business to continue to have a significant impact on our quarterly financial results in the future 



markets 

our primary target customers are consumers small businesses and the selfemployed we also provide specialized tax products to accounting professionals who are key partners to help us reach small business customers the markets in which we compete have always been characterized by rapid technological change shifting customer needs and frequent new product introductions and enhancements by competitors over the past several years the widespread usage of mobile devices and the explosion of social media have accelerated the pace of change and revolutionized the way that customers learn about evaluate and purchase products and services 

realtime personalized online and mobile shopping experiences are the standard in addition many customers now begin shopping in one channel and ultimately purchase in another this has created a need for integrated multichannel shopandbuy experiences market and industry changes quickly make existing products and services obsolete our success depends on our ability to respond rapidly to these changes with new business models updated competitive strategies new or enhanced products and services alternative distribution methods and other changes in the way we do business 

marketing programs 

we use a variety of marketing programs to generate direct sales develop leads increase general awareness of our product portfolio and drive sales in retail these programs include digital marketing such as display and payperclick advertising search engine optimization and social and affiliate marketing mobile marketing through online app stores email marketing offline marketing such as tv radio billboard magazine and newspaper advertising retail marketing public relations and in product marketing to drive awareness of related products and services our campaigns are designed to attract new users retain existing users and cross sell additional offerings 

sales and distribution channels 

multichannel shopandbuy experiences  our customers use the web and mobile devices to research products and services some customers buy and use our products and services entirely online or through their mobile devices others research online but make their purchase at a retail location because many customers shop across multiple channels we continue to coordinate our online offline and retail presence and promotions to support an integrated multichannel shopandbuy model 

direct sales channel  we sell many of our products and services directly through our websites and call centers direct online sales are an effective channel for customers who can make purchase decisions based on content provided on our websites via other online content or word of mouth recommendations telesales continues to be an effective channel for serving customers that want live help to select the products and services that are right for their needs we also have a direct sales force that calls on us and international accounting firms and seeks to increase their awareness usage and recommendation of our small business and professional tax solutions

overview 

we face intense competition in all of our businesses both domestically and internationally competitive interest and expertise in many of the markets we serve have grown markedly over the past few years and we expect this trend to continue some of our existing competitors have significantly greater financial technical and marketing resources than we do in addition the competitive landscape can shift rapidly as new companies enter markets in which we compete this is particularly true for online and mobile products and services where the barriers to entry are lower than they are for desktop software products and services to attract customers many online and mobile competitors are offering free or lowpriced products which we must take into account in our pricing strategies 

our most obvious competition comes from other companies that offer technology solutions similar to ours however for many of our products and services other important competitive alternatives for customers are thirdparty service providers such as professional accountants and seasonal assisted tax preparation businesses manual tools and processes or generalpurpose software are also important competitive alternatives 

competition specific to segments 

small business  selfemployed segment  quickbooks is the leading small business financial management software in the us our small business desktop products and services face competitive challenges from companies such as the sage group plc which offers software and associated services that directly target small business customers our small business online products and services face competition from online accounting offerings from companies such as xero and freshbooks free or lowcost online accounting offerings and free online banking and bill payment services offered by financial institutions and others in our payroll business we compete directly with automatic data processing inc adp paychex gusto and many other companies with payroll offerings including online payroll offerings in our merchant services business we compete directly with large financial institutions such as wells fargo jp morgan chase and bank of america and with many payment processors including first data corporation elavon global payments fidelity national information services paypal and square 

consumer segment  in our consumer segment our future growth depends on our ability to attract new customers to the selfpreparation tax category or to our new assisted offering turbotax live from tax stores and other tax preparers in the us private sector we face intense competition from hr block which provides tax preparation services in its stores and a competing software offering we also face competition from several other large tax preparation service providers from a myriad of small tax preparers and from numerous online selfpreparation offerings including blucora’s taxact and credit karma some of these competitors are offering electronic tax preparation and filing services at no cost to individual taxpayers in canada our turbotax canada offerings face competition from hr block simpletax studiotax and ufile these competing offerings subject us to significant price pressure in both the us and canada 

we also face competitive challenges from government entities that offer publicly funded electronic tax preparation and filing services with no fees to individual taxpayers we are a member of the free file alliance a consortium of private sector companies that has entered into an agreement with the federal government under this agreement the member companies provide online federal tax preparation and filing services to eligible users at no cost to the government or individual users and the federal government has agreed not to provide a duplicative or competing service approximately 23 states have also adopted free file alliance publicprivate agreements while approximately 19 other states offer some form of direct government tax preparation and filing services with no fees to qualified taxpayers we continue to actively work with others in the private and public sectors to advance the goals of the free file alliance policy initiative and to support successful publicprivate partnerships that reinforce the voluntary compliance tax system however future administrative regulatory or 



tables of contents 

legislative activity in this area could seek to replace the voluntary compliance tax system with return preparation by government agencies which could harm our consumer business 

strategic partner segment  in the us lacerte professional tax offerings face competition from competitivelypriced tax and accounting solutions that include integration with nontax functionality these include cch’s prosystems fx office suite and thomson reuters’ cs professional suite and gosystems tax our proseries professional tax offerings face competition from cch’s atx and taxwise offerings drake and other smaller providers in canada our profile professional tax offerings face competition from cch’s cantax and taxprep offerings taxcycle and thomson reuters’ dtmax and ufile pro offerings we also face growing competition from online tax and accounting offerings in the us and canada which may be marketed more effectively or have lower pricing than our offerings for accounting professionals 

competitive factors 

we believe the most important competitive factors for our core offerings – quickbooks turbotax lacerte and proseries – are ease of use product features size of the installed customer base brand name recognition value proposition cost reliability security and product and support quality access to distribution channels is also important for our quickbooks and turbotax desktop software products in addition support from accounting professionals and the ability for customers to upgrade within product families as their businesses grow are significant competitive factors for our quickbooks products productivity is an important competitive factor for the fullservice accounting firms to which we market our lacerte software products we believe we compete effectively on these factors as our quickbooks and turbotax products are the leading products in the us for their respective categories 

for our service offerings such as small business payroll and merchant payment processing we believe the most important competitive factors are functionality ease of use high availability security the integration of these products with related software brand name recognition effective distribution quality of support and cost 



we provide customer service and technical support by telephone email online and video chat text messaging online communities and our customer service and technical support websites we have fulltime and outsourced customer service and technical support staffs we supplement these staffs with seasonal employees and additional outsourcing during periods of peak call volumes such as during the tax return filing season or following a major product launch we outsource to several firms domestically and internationally most of our internationally outsourced small business customer service and technical support personnel are currently located in india and the philippines 

we offer free selfhelp information through our technical support websites for our quickbooks turbotax and professional tax offerings customers can also use our websites to find answers to commonly asked questions and check on the status of orders under certain paid support plans customers can also use our websites to receive product updates electronically support alternatives and fees vary by product we sponsor online user communities such as intuit community for small businesses and accounting professionals and turbotax answerxchange where consumers can share knowledge and product advice with each other we also offer live tax advice from usbased tax professionals to turbotax live users 



online products and services 

our online offerings include quickbooks online online payroll services merchant payment processing services turbotax online proconnect tax online consumer and professional electronic tax filing services mint and turbo we continue to execute on a multiyear plan to transition the systems networks and databases required to operate these online offerings to amazon web services aws currently several of our core online offerings are using aws the remaining online offerings are housed in data centers located in geographically diverse locations as our businesses continue to move toward delivering personalized experiences trusted open platforms and indispensable connections we expect that our infrastructure will become even more critical to our business in the future 

desktop software and supplies 

although an increasing proportion of our desktop software customers choose to electronically download software many customers continue to choose to purchase these products in the form of physical media the key processes in manufacturing desktop software are manufacturing compact discs cds and digital video discs dvds printing boxes and related materials and assembling and shipping the final products 

for retail manufacturing we have an agreement with arvato digital services inc arvato a division of bertelsmann ag under which arvato provides a majority of the manufacturing volume for our launches of quickbooks and turbotax as well as for daytoday replenishment after product launches arvato has operations in multiple locations that can provide redundancy if necessary 



tables of contents 

for retail distribution we have an agreement with arvato under which arvato handles all logistics services our retail product launches are operationally complex our model for product delivery for retail launches and replenishment is a hybrid of direct to store deliveries and shipments to central warehouse locations this allows improved inventory management by our retailers we also ship products for many of our smaller retail customers through distributors 

arvato also provides most of the manufacturing volume and distribution services for our direct desktop software orders we have an exclusive agreement with harland clarke a division of mf worldwide corporation to fulfill orders for all of our printed checks and most other products for our financial supplies business 

we have multiple sources for all of our raw materials and availability has historically not been a significant problem for us we continue to see consolidation among cddvd suppliers and reduced demand overall for this media type as a result we believe cddvd media may become more difficult and more costly to obtain in the near future 

customers typically receive desktop software electronically however when physical product is ordered we typically ship the physical product within a few days of receiving an order and backlog is minimal 



we are stewards of our customers’ data and have designed data stewardship principles to align our organization in collecting using and protecting such information as we believe strongly in being good stewards of our customers’ data we operate our program to comply with laws and regulations that regulate our use and protection of customers’ personal information including for example laws with respect to financial services and the handling of tax data we have established guidelines and practices to help ensure that customers and employees are aware of and can control how we use information about them we also use privacy statements to provide notice to customers of our privacy practices as well as provide them the opportunity to furnish instructions with respect to use of their personal information we participate in industry groups whose purpose is to develop or shape industry best practices and to inform public policy for privacy and security 

we use security safeguards to help protect the systems and the information customers and employees give to us from loss misuse and unauthorized alteration we use technical logical and procedural measures such as multifactor authentication which are designed to help detect and prevent fraud and misuse of customer information whenever customers transmit sensitive information to us such as credit card information or tax return data through one of our websites or products we follow current industry standards to encrypt the data as it is transmitted to us and when we store it at rest we routinely patch our systems with security updates and we work to protect our systems from unauthorized internal or external access using numerous commercially available computer security products as well as internally developed security procedures and practices 



our consumer and strategic partner segments are subject to federal and state government requirements including regulations related to the electronic filing of tax returns the provision of tax preparer assistance and the use and disclosure of customer information in addition our small business  selfemployed segment offers products and services to small businesses and consumers such as payroll payments and financing which are also subject to certain regulatory requirements 



our success depends on the proprietary technology embodied in our offerings we protect this proprietary technology by relying on a variety of intellectual property mechanisms including copyright patent trade secret and trademark laws restrictions on disclosure and other methods for example we regularly file applications for patents copyrights and trademarks and service marks in order to protect intellectual property that we believe is important to our business we hold a growing patent portfolio that we believe is important to intuit’s overall competitive advantage although we are not materially dependent on any one patent or particular group of patents in our portfolio at this time we also have a number of registered trademarks that include intuit quickbooks lacerte turbotax qb proseries proconnect and mint we have registered these and other trademarks and service marks in the united states and depending on the relevance of each brand to other markets in many foreign countries most registrations can be renewed perpetually at 10year intervals we also license intellectual property from third parties for use in our products 

although our portfolio of patents is growing the patents that have been issued to us could be determined to be invalid and may not be enforceable against competitive products in every jurisdiction in addition third parties have asserted and may in the future assert infringement claims against us and our customers these claims and any litigation may result in invalidation of our proprietary rights or a finding of infringement along with an assessment of damages litigation even if without merit could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention in addition thirdparty licenses may not continue to be available to us on commercially acceptable terms or at all 



tables of contents 



as of july 31 2018  we had approximately 8900 fulltime employees in major offices in the united states canada india the united kingdom israel australia and other locations we also employ a significant number of seasonal and contract employees during the second and third quarters of our fiscal years to support our consumer segment customers for example at the peak of the 2017 tax season we employed approximately 2400 seasonal employees we believe our future success and growth will depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees in all areas of our business we do not currently have any collective bargaining agreements with our employees and we believe employee relations are generally good although we have employmentrelated agreements with a number of key employees these agreements do not guarantee continued service we believe we offer competitive compensation and a good working environment we were named one of fortune magazine’s “100 best companies to work for” in each of the last seventeen years however we face intense competition for qualified employees and we expect to face continuing challenges in recruiting and retention

 item 1a  risk factors 

tableend

our businesses routinely encounter and address risks many of which could cause our future results to be materially different than we presently anticipate below we describe certain important risks categorized solely for ease of reference as strategic operational legal and compliance and financial risks the manner in which we respond to future developments as well as our competitors’ reactions to those developments may affect our future operating results 

strategic risks 

strategic risks relate to our current and future operating model business plans and growth strategy including the risks associated with the following competitive pressures on our product offerings and business models our ability to adapt to technological changes and global trends our reliance on thirdparty intellectual property and our ability to protect our own intellectual property rights the value of our brand and mergers acquisitions and divestiture activity that may have unanticipated costs and expenses 

we face intense competitive pressures that may harm our operating results 

we face intense competition in all of our businesses and we expect competition to remain intense in the future our competitors and potential competitors range from large and established entities to emerging startups our competitors may introduce superior products and services reduce prices have greater technical marketing and other resources have greater name recognition have larger installed bases of customers have wellestablished relationships with our current and potential customers advertise aggressively or beat us to market with new products and services in addition we may face competition from existing companies with large established consumer userbases and broadbased platforms who may change or expand the focus of their business strategies and marketing to target our customers including small businesses and tax customers 

we also face competition from companies with a variety of business models and monetization strategies including increased competition from providers of free offerings particularly in our tax accounting and payments businesses in order to compete we have also introduced free offerings in several categories but we may not be able to attract customers as effectively as competitors with different business models in addition we may not be able to monetize our free offerings if other providers of free offerings provide features that we do not offer and customers who have formerly paid for intuit’s products and services may elect to use our competitors’ free offerings instead these competitive factors may diminish our revenue and profitability and harm our ability to acquire and retain customers 

our consumer tax business also faces significant competition from the public sector where we face the risk of federal and state taxing authorities proposing revenue raising strategies that involve developing and providing government tax software or other government return preparation systems at public expense these or similar programs may be introduced or expanded in the future which may change the voluntary compliance tax system in ways that could cause us to lose customers and revenue the irs free file program is currently the sole means by which the irs offers tax software to taxpayers and as part of the program the irs has agreed it will not offer a duplicative or competing service under this program the irs has worked with private industry to provide more than 50 million free returns since 2003 utilizing donated private sector tax software and efiling services for low and middle income taxpayers at no cost to the government or individual users however its continuation depends on a number of factors including increasing public awareness of and access to the free program as well as continued government support the current agreement is scheduled to expire in october 2020 if the free file program were to be terminated and the irs were to enter the software development and return preparation space the federal government would become a publicly funded direct competitor of the us tax services industry and of intuit government funded services that curtail or eliminate the role of taxpayers in preparing their own taxes could potentially have material and adverse revenue implications 

future revenue growth depends upon our ability to adapt to technological change as well as global trends in the way customers access software offerings and successfully introduce new and enhanced products services and business models 

online offerings desktop software and mobile technology industries are characterized by rapidly changing technology evolving industry standards and frequent new product introductions we must continue to innovate and develop new products and features to meet changing customer needs and attract and retain talented software developers we need to continue to develop our skills tools and capabilities to capitalize on existing and emerging technologies which require us to devote significant resources 

our consumer and professional tax businesses depend significantly on revenue from customers who return each year to use our updated tax preparation and filing software and services as our existing products mature encouraging customers to purchase product upgrades becomes more challenging unless new product releases provide features and functionality that have meaningful incremental value we also provide additional customer benefits by utilizing customer data available to us through our existing offerings if we are not able to develop and clearly demonstrate the value of new or upgraded products or services to our customers or effectively utilize our customers’ data our revenues may be harmed in addition as we continue to introduce and expand our new business models including offerings that are free to end users we may be 



tables of contents 

unsuccessful in monetizing or increasing customer adoption of these offerings or our risk profile may change resulting in loss of revenue 

the number of people who access products and services through devices other than personal computers including mobile phones smartphones and handheld computers such as tablets continues to increase we have devoted significant resources to develop products and services for users of these alternative devices but the versions of our products and services developed for these devices may not be compelling to users even if we are able to attract new users through these mobile offerings the amount of revenue that we derive per user from mobile offerings may be less than the revenue that we have historically derived from users of personal computers as new devices and new platforms are continually being released it is difficult to predict the problems we may encounter in developing versions of our products and services for use on these alternative devices and we may need to devote significant resources to the creation support and maintenance of such offerings if we are slow to develop products and technologies that are compatible with these alternative devices or if our competitors are able to achieve those results more quickly than us we will fail to capture a significant share of an increasingly important portion of the market for online services which could adversely affect our business further legislation or regulatory changes may mandate changes in our products that make them less attractive to users 

in some cases we may expend a significant amount of resources and management attention on offerings that do not ultimately succeed in their markets we have encountered difficulty in launching new products and services in the past if we misjudge customer needs in the future our new products and services may not succeed and our revenues and earnings may be harmed we have also invested and in the future expect to invest in new business models geographies strategies and initiatives such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties including distraction of management from current operations expenses associated with the initiatives and inadequate return on investments because these new initiatives are inherently risky they may not be successful and may harm our financial condition and operating results 

we rely on thirdparty intellectual property in our products and services 

many of our products and services include intellectual property of third parties which we license under agreements that may need to be renewed or renegotiated from time to time we may not be able to obtain licenses to these thirdparty technologies or content on reasonable terms or at all if we are unable to obtain the rights necessary to use this intellectual property in our products and services we may not be able to sell the affected offerings and customers who are currently using the affected product may be disrupted which may in turn harm our future financial results damage our brand and result in customer loss also we and our customers have been and may continue to be subject to infringement claims as a result of the thirdparty intellectual property incorporated in our offerings although we try to mitigate this risk and we may not be ultimately liable for any potential infringement pending claims require us to use significant resources require management attention and could result in loss of customers 

some of our offerings include thirdparty software that is licensed under socalled “open source” licenses some of which may include a requirement that under certain circumstances we make available or grant licenses to any modifications or derivative works we create based upon the open source software although we have established internal review and approval processes to mitigate these risks we may not be sure that all open source software is submitted for approval prior to use in our products many of the risks associated with usage of open source may not be eliminated and may if not properly addressed harm our business 

our intellectual property rights are valuable and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products services and brand 

our patents trademarks trade secrets copyrights domain names and other intellectual property rights are important assets for us we aggressively protect our intellectual property rights by relying on federal state and common law rights in the us and internationally as well as a variety of administrative procedures we also rely on contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary rights in products and services the efforts that we take to protect our proprietary rights may not always be sufficient or effective protecting our intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming and may not be successful in every location any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business our brand and our ability to compete 

policing unauthorized use and copying of our products is difficult expensive and time consuming current us laws that prohibit copying give us only limited practical protection from software piracy and the laws of many other countries provide very little protection we frequently encounter unauthorized copies of our software being sold through online marketplaces although we continue to evaluate and put in place technology solutions to attempt to lessen the impact of piracy and engage in efforts to educate consumers and public policy leaders on these issues and cooperate with industry groups in their efforts to combat piracy we expect piracy to be a persistent problem that results in lost revenues and increased expenses 

our business depends on our strong reputation and the value of our brands 

developing and maintaining awareness of our brands is critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our existing and future products and services and is an important element in attracting new customers adverse publicity whether or not justified relating to events or activities attributed to us our employees agents third parties we rely on or our users may tarnish our reputation and reduce the value of our brands our brand value also depends on our ability to provide secure and trustworthy 



tables of contents 

products and services as well as our ability to protect and use our customers’ data in a manner that meets their expectations in addition a security incident which results in unauthorized disclosure of our customers’ sensitive data could cause material reputational harm damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity may reduce demand for our products and services and thus have an adverse effect on our future financial results as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of the brands and could also reduce our stock price 

our acquisition and divestiture activities may disrupt our ongoing business may involve increased expenses and may present risks not contemplated at the time of the transactions 

we have acquired and may continue to acquire companies products technologies and talent that complement our strategic direction both in and outside the united states acquisitions involve significant risks and uncertainties including 

 we have divested and may in the future divest certain assets or businesses that no longer fit with our strategic direction or growth targets divestitures involve significant risks and uncertainties including 

 because acquisitions and divestitures are inherently risky our transactions may not be successful and may in some cases harm our operating results or financial condition although we typically fund our acquisitions through cash available from operations if we were to use debt to fund acquisitions or for other purposes our interest expense and leverage would increase significantly and if we were to issue equity securities as consideration in an acquisition current shareholders’ percentage ownership and earnings per share would be diluted 

operational risks 

operational risks arise from internal and external events relating to systems processes and people risks that affect the operation of our businesses include the following potential security incidents privacy and cybersecurity concerns relating to online offerings fraudulent activities by third parties relationships with third parties competition for and retention of key talent issues with our product launches problems with our information technology infrastructure and risks associated with operating internationally

security incidents improper access to or disclosure of our data or customers’ data or other cyberattacks on our systems could harm our reputation and adversely affect our business 

we host collect use and retain large amounts of sensitive and personal customer and employee data including credit card information tax return information bank account numbers login credentials and passwords personal and business financial data and transactions data social security numbers and payroll information as well as our confidential nonpublic business information we use commercially available security technologies and security and business controls to limit access to and use of such sensitive data although we expend significant resources to create security protections designed to shield this data against potential theft and security breaches such measures cannot provide absolute security 

our technologies systems and networks have been subject to and are likely to continue to be the target of cyberattacks computer viruses worms phishing attacks malicious software programs and other cybersecurity incidents that could result in the unauthorized release gathering monitoring use loss or destruction of our customers’ or employees’ sensitive and personal data or intuits sensitive business data or cause temporary or sustained unavailability of our software and systems these types of attacks can be made by individuals groups of hackers and sophisticated organizations including statesponsored organizations or nationstates themselves customers who fail to update their systems continue to run software that we no longer support or that fail to install security patches on a timely basis create vulnerabilities and make it more difficult for us to detect and prevent these kinds of attacks we are increasingly incorporating open source software into our products there may be vulnerabilities in open source software that make it susceptible to cyberattacks in addition because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to sensitive information change frequently and are becoming more sophisticated and are often not able to be detected until after a successful attack we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventive measures although this is an industrywide problem that affects software and hardware across platforms it may increasingly affect our offerings because cybercriminals tend to focus their efforts on wellknown offerings that are popular among customers and hold sensitive information and we expect them to continue to do so 

further the security measures that we implement may not be able to prevent unauthorized access to our products and our customers’ account data third parties may fraudulently induce employees customers or users by means such as email phishing to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our systems it is also possible that unauthorized access to or disclosure of customer data may occur due to inadequate use of security controls by our customers or our employees accounts created with weak or recycled passwords could allow cyberattackers to gain access to customer data unauthorized persons could gain access to customer accounts if customers do not maintain effective access controls of their systems and software 

criminals may also use stolen identity information obtained outside of our systems to gain unauthorized access to our customers’ data we have experienced such instances in the past and as the accessibility of stolen identity information increases generally we may experience further instances of unauthorized access to our systems using our customers’ or employees’ stolen identity information in the future further our customers may choose to use the same user id and password across multiple products and services unrelated to our products such customers’ login credentials may be stolen from products offered by third party service providers unrelated to us and the stolen identity information may be used by a malicious third party to access our products which could result in disclosure of confidential information 

our efforts to protect data may also be unsuccessful due to software bugs whether open source or proprietary code breakins employee error or other threats that evolve 

further because we have created an ecosystem where customers can have one identity across multiple intuit products a security incident may give access to increased amounts of customer data this may result in disclosure of confidential information loss of customer confidence in our products possible litigation material harm to our reputation and financial condition disruption of our or our customers’ business operations and decline in our stock price from time to time we detect or receive notices from customers or public or private agencies that they have detected actual or perceived vulnerabilities in our servers our software or thirdparty software components that are distributed with our products or fraudulent activity by unauthorized persons utilizing our products with stolen customer identity information the existence of such vulnerabilities or fraudulent activity even if they do not result in a security breach may undermine customer confidence as well as the confidence of government agencies that regulate our offerings such perceived vulnerabilities could also seriously harm our business by tarnishing our reputation and brand andor limiting the adoption of our products and services and could cause our stock price to decline 

a cybersecurity incident affecting the third parties we rely on could expose us or our customers to a risk of loss or misuse of confidential information and significantly damage our reputation 

we depend on a number of third parties including vendors developers and partners who are critical to our business we or our customers may grant access to customer data to these third parties to help deliver customer benefits or to host certain of our and our customers sensitive and personal data in addition we share sensitive nonpublic business information including for example materials relating to financial business and legal strategies with other vendors in the ordinary course of business 

while we conduct background checks of our workforce conduct reviews of partners developers and vendors and use commercially available technologies to limit access to systems and data it is possible that one or more of these individuals or third parties may misrepresent their intended use of data or may circumvent our controls resulting in accidental or intentional disclosure or misuse of our customers’ or employees’ data further while we conduct due diligence on these third parties with respect to their security and business controls we may not have the ability to effectively monitor or oversee the 



tables of contents 

implementation of these control measures individuals or third parties may be able to circumvent these security and business controls andor exploit vulnerabilities that may exist in these controls resulting in the disclosure or misuse of sensitive business and personal customer or employee information and data 

a security incident involving third parties whom we rely on may have serious negative consequences for our businesses including disclosure of sensitive customer or employee data or confidential or competitively sensitive information regarding our business including intellectual property and other proprietary data make our products more vulnerable to fraudulent activity cause temporary or sustained unavailability of our software and systems result in possible litigation fines penalties and damages result in loss of customer confidence cause material harm to our reputation and brands lead to further regulation and oversight by federal or state agencies cause adverse financial condition and result in a reduced stock price 

concerns about the current privacy and cybersecurity environment generally could deter current and potential customers from adopting our products and services and damage our reputation 

the continued occurrence of cyberattacks and data breaches on governments businesses and consumers in general indicates that we operate in an external environment where cyberattacks and data breaches are becoming increasingly common if the global cybersecurity environment worsens and there are increased instances of security breaches of thirdparty offerings where consumers’ data and sensitive information is compromised consumers may be less willing to use online offerings particularly offerings like ours in which customers often share sensitive financial data in addition the increased availability of data obtained as a result of breaches of thirdparty offerings could make our own products more vulnerable to fraudulent activity even if our products are not affected directly by such incidents they could damage our reputation and deter current and potential customers from adopting our products and services or lead customers to cease using online and connected software products to transact financial business altogether 

if we are unable to effectively combat the increasing amount and sophistication of fraudulent activities by third parties using our offerings we may suffer losses which may be substantial and lose the confidence of our customers and government agencies and our revenues and earnings may be harmed 

the online tax preparation payroll administration and online payments industries have been experiencing an increasing amount of fraudulent activities by third parties and those fraudulent activities are becoming increasingly sophisticated although we do not believe that any of this activity is uniquely targeted at our products or business this type of fraudulent activity may adversely impact our tax payroll and payments businesses in addition to any losses that may result from such fraud which may be substantial a loss of confidence by our customers or by governmental agencies in our ability to prevent fraudulent activity that is perpetrated through our offerings may seriously harm our business and damage our brand if we cannot adequately combat such fraudulent activity that is perpetrated through our tax offerings governmental authorities may refuse to allow us to continue to offer such services which could include federal or state tax authorities refusing to allow us to process our customers’ tax returns electronically resulting in a significant adverse impact on our earnings and revenue as fraudulent activities become more pervasive and increasingly sophisticated and fraud detection and prevention measures must become correspondingly more complex to combat them across the various industries in which we operate we may implement risk control mechanisms that could make it more difficult for legitimate customers to obtain and use our products which could result in lost revenue and negatively impact our earnings 

if we fail to process transactions effectively or fail to adequately protect against disputed or potential fraudulent activities our business may be harmed 

our operations process a significant volume and dollar value of transactions on a daily basis especially in our payroll and payments businesses despite our efforts to ensure that effective processing systems and controls are in place to handle transactions appropriately it is possible that we may make errors or that funds may be misappropriated due to fraud the systems supporting our business are comprised of multiple technology platforms that are sometimes difficult to scale if we are unable to effectively manage our systems and processes or if there is an error in our products we may be unable to process customer data in an accurate reliable and timely manner which may harm our reputation the willingness of customers to use our products and our financial results in our payments processing service business if merchants for whom we process payment transactions are unable to pay refunds due to their customers in connection with disputed or fraudulent merchant transactions we may be required to pay those amounts and our payments may exceed the amount of the customer reserves we have established to make such payments 

business interruption or failure of our information technology and communication systems may impair the availability of our products and services which may damage our reputation and harm our future financial results 

our reputation and ability to attract retain and serve our customers is dependent upon the reliable performance of our products and our underlying technical infrastructure as we continue to grow our online services we become more dependent on the continuing operation and availability of our information technology and communications systems and those of our external service providers including for example thirdparty internetbased or cloud computing services we do not have redundancy for all of our systems and our disaster recovery planning may not account for all eventualities we have designed a significant portion of our software and computer systems to utilize data processing and storage capabilities provided by 



tables of contents 

amazon web services aws if aws is unavailable to us for any reason our customers may not be able to access certain of our cloud products or features which could significantly impact our operations business and financial results 

failure of our systems or those of our thirdparty service providers may result in interruptions in our service and loss of data or processing capabilities all of which may cause a loss in customers refunds of product fees material harm to our reputation and operating results 

our tax businesses must effectively handle extremely heavy customer demand during critical peak periods from january until april of each year we face significant risks in maintaining adequate service levels during these peak periods when we derive a substantial portion of our overall revenue from the tax businesses any interruptions in our online tax preparation or electronic filing service at any time during the tax season particularly during a peak period could result in significantly decreased revenue lost customers unexpected refunds of customer charges negative publicity and increased operating costs any of which could significantly harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

we rely on internal systems and external systems maintained by manufacturers distributors and other service providers to take and fulfill customer orders handle customer service requests and host certain online activities any interruption or failure of our internal or external systems may prevent us or our service providers from accepting and fulfilling customer orders or cause company and customer data to be unintentionally disclosed our continuing efforts to upgrade and expand our network security and other information systems as well as our highavailability capabilities may be costly and problems with the design or implementation of system enhancements may harm our business and our results of operations 

our business operations data centers information technology and communications systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters human error malicious attacks fire power loss telecommunications failures computer viruses computer denial of service attacks terrorist attacks and other events beyond our control in addition our corporate headquarters and other critical business operations are located near major seismic faults in the event of a major natural or manmade disaster our insurance coverage may not completely compensate us for our losses and our future financial results may be materially harmed 

we regularly invest resources to update and improve our internal information technology systems and software platforms should our investments not succeed or if delays or other issues with new or existing internal technology systems and software platforms disrupt our operations our business could be harmed 

we rely on our network and data center infrastructure and internal technology systems for many of our development marketing operational support sales accounting and financial reporting activities we are continually investing resources to update and improve these systems and environments in order to meet existing needs as well as the growing and changing requirements of our business and customers if we experience prolonged delays or unforeseen difficulties in updating and upgrading our systems and architecture we may experience outages and may not be able to deliver certain offerings and develop new offerings and enhancements that we need to remain competitive such improvements and upgrades are often complex costly and time consuming in addition such improvements can be challenging to integrate with our existing technology systems or may uncover problems with our existing technology systems unsuccessful implementation of hardware or software updates and improvements could result in outages disruption in our business operations loss of revenue or damage to our reputation 

if we are unable to develop manage and maintain critical thirdparty business relationships our business may be adversely affected 

our growth is increasingly dependent on the strength of our business relationships and our ability to continue to develop manage and maintain new and existing relationships with third party partners we rely on various thirdparty partners including software and service providers suppliers vendors manufacturers distributors accountants contractors financial institutions core processors licensing partners and development partners among others in many areas of our business in order to deliver our offerings and operate our business we also rely on third parties to support the operation of our business by maintaining our physical facilities equipment power systems and infrastructure in certain instances these thirdparty relationships are sole source or limited source relationships and can be difficult to replace or substitute depending on the level of integration of the third party’s products or services into or with our offerings andor the general availability of such third party’s products and services in addition there may be few or no alternative thirdparty providers or vendors in the market further there can be no assurance that we will be able to adequately retain thirdparty contractors engaged to help us operate our business the failure of third parties to provide acceptable and high quality products services and technologies or to update their products services and technologies may result in a disruption to our business operations and our customers which may reduce our revenues and profits cause us to lose customers and damage our reputation alternative arrangements and services may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all or we may experience business interruptions upon a transition to an alternative partner 

although we have strict standards for our suppliers and business partners to comply with the law and company policies regarding workplace and employment practices data use and security environmental compliance intellectual property licensing and other applicable regulatory and compliance requirements we cannot control their daytoday practices if any of them violate laws or implement practices regarded as unethical we could experience supply chain disruptions canceled orders terminations of or damage to key relationships and damage to our reputation 



tables of contents 

in particular we have relationships with banks credit unions and other financial institutions that support certain critical services we offer to our customers if macroeconomic conditions or other factors cause any of these institutions to fail consolidate stop providing certain services or institute costcutting efforts our business and financial results may suffer and we may be unable to offer those services to our customers 

we increasingly utilize the distribution platforms of third parties like apple’s app store and google’s play store for the distribution of certain of our product offerings although we benefit from the strong brand recognition and large user base of these distribution platforms to attract new customers the platform owners have wide discretion to change the pricing structure terms of service and other policies with respect to us and other developers any adverse changes by these third parties could adversely affect our financial results 

because competition for our key employees is intense we may not be able to attract retain and develop the highly skilled employees we need to support our planned growth 

much of our future success depends on the continued service and availability of skilled personnel including members of our executive team and those in technical and other key positions experienced personnel in the software mobile technologies data science data security and software as a service industries are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense especially in california and india where the majority of our employees are located also as we strive to continue to adapt to technological change and introduce new and enhanced products and business models we must be able to secure maintain and develop the right quality and quantity of engaged and committed talent the incentives we have available to attract retain and motivate employees provided by our equity awards may become less effective and if we were to issue significant equity to attract additional employees the ownership of our existing stockholders would be diluted although we strive to be an employer of choice we may not be able to continue to successfully attract retain and develop key personnel which may cause our business to suffer 

the nature of our products and services necessitates timely product launches and if we experience significant product accuracy or quality problems or delays it may harm our revenue earnings and reputation 

all of our tax products and many of our nontax products have rigid development timetables that increase the risk of errors in our products and the risk of launch delays our tax preparation software product development cycle is particularly challenging due to the need to incorporate unpredictable and potentially late tax law and tax form changes each year and because our customers expect high levels of accuracy and a timely launch of these products to prepare and file their taxes by the tax filing deadline due to the complexity of our products and the condensed development cycles under which we operate our products may contain errors that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the software or result in incorrect calculations the complexity of the tax laws on which our products are based may also make it difficult for us to consistently deliver offerings that contain the features functionality and level of accuracy that our customers expect when we encounter problems we may be required to modify our code work with state tax administrators to communicate with affected customers assist customers with amendments distribute patches to customers who have already purchased the product and recall or repackage existing product inventory in our distribution channels if we encounter development challenges or discover errors in our products either late in our development cycle or after release it may cause us to delay our product launch date or suspend product availability until such issues can be fixed any major defects launch delays or product suspensions may lead to loss of customers and revenue negative publicity customer and employee dissatisfaction reduced retailer shelf space and promotions and increased operating expenses such as inventory replacement costs legal fees or other payments including those resulting from our accuracy guarantee in our tax preparation products for example an error in our tax products could cause a compliance error for taxpayers including the over or underpayment of their federal or state tax liability while our accuracy guarantee commits us to reimburse penalties and interest paid by customers due solely to calculation errors in our tax preparation products such errors may result in additional burdens on third parties that we may need to address or that may cause us to suspend the availability of our products until such errors are addressed this could also affect our reputation the willingness of customers to use our products and our financial results 

our international operations are subject to increased risks which may harm our business operating results and financial condition 

in addition to uncertainty about our ability to generate revenues from our foreign operations and expand into international markets there are risks inherent in doing business internationally including 





tables of contents 

 violations of the rapidly evolving and complex foreign and us laws and regulations that apply to our international operations may result in fines criminal actions or sanctions against us our officers or our employees prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with these laws there can be no assurance that our employees contractors or agents will not violate our policies these risks inherent in our international operations and expansion increase our costs of doing business internationally and may result in harm to our business operating results and financial condition 

legal and compliance risks 

legal and compliance risks arise from change in the government and regulatory environment including complex and evolving regulations relating privacy and data security potential litigation regulatory inquiries and intellectual property infringement claims 

increased government regulation of our businesses or changes to existing regulations may harm our operating results 

the company is subject to federal state and local laws and regulations that affect the company’s activities including without limitation areas of labor advertising tax financial services data privacy and security digital content consumer protection real estate billing ecommerce promotions quality of services intellectual property ownership and infringement import and export requirements anticorruption foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions anticompetition environmental health and safety there have been significant new regulations and heightened focus by the government on many of these areas as well as in areas such as insurance and privacy a s we expand our products and services and revise our business models both domestically and internationally we may become subject to additional government regulation or increased regulatory scrutiny further regulators both in the us and in other jurisdictions in which we operate may adopt new laws or regulations change existing regulations or their interpretation of existing laws or regulations may differ from ours 

the tax preparation industry continues to receive heightened attention from federal and state governments new legislation regulation public policy considerations changes in the cybersecurity environment litigation by the government or private entities changes to or new interpretations of existing laws may result in greater oversight of the tax preparation industry restrict the types of products and services that we can offer or the prices we can charge or otherwise cause us to change the way we operate our tax businesses or offer our tax products and services we may not be able to respond quickly to such regulatory legislative and other developments and these changes may in turn increase our cost of doing business and limit our revenue opportunities in addition if our practices are not consistent with new interpretations of existing laws we may become subject to lawsuits penalties and other liabilities that did not previously apply we are also required to comply with a variety of state revenue agency standards in order to successfully operate our tax preparation and electronic filing services 

changes in stateimposed requirements by one or more of the states including the required use of specific technologies or technology standards may significantly increase the costs of providing those services to our customers and may prevent us from delivering a quality product to our customers in a timely manner 

we are also subject to certain laws and regulations in the us and other jurisdictions relating to electronic funds transfer money transmission lending and other regulated activities in the event laws governing regulated activities change or expand we may be subject to additional compliance costs 



tables of contents 

complex and evolving us and international laws and regulation regarding privacy and data protection could result in claims changes to our business practices penalties increased cost of operations or otherwise harm our business 

regulations related to the provision of online services is evolving as federal state and foreign governments continue to adopt new or modify existing laws and regulations addressing data privacy and the collection processing storage transfer and use of data this includes for example the eus new regulation the general data protection regulation gdpr and the new california consumer protection act ccpa which will become effective on january 1 2020 in our efforts to meet the gdpr ccpa and other data privacy regulations we have made and continue to make certain operational changes to our products and business practices if we are unable to engineer products that meet these evolving requirements or help our customers meet their obligations under these or other new data regulations we might experience reduced demand for our offerings further penalties for noncompliance with these laws may be significant 

in addition there are global privacy treaties and frameworks that have created compliance uncertainty and increased complexity for example the european commission and the swiss government approved the euus and swissus privacy shield frameworks respectively that provide a mechanism for companies to legally transfer personal data from the eu and switzerland to the us however these frameworks as well as other personal data transfer mechanisms face a number of legal challenges both by regulators and private parties a change in these transfer mechanisms could cause us to incur costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business 

other governmental authorities throughout the us and around the world are considering similar types of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection each of these privacy security and data protection laws and regulations could impose significant limitations require changes to our business require notification to customers or workers of a security breach restrict our use or storage of personal information or cause changes in customer purchasing behavior which may make our business more costly less efficient or impossible to conduct and may require us to modify our current or future products or services which may make customers less likely to purchase our products and may harm our future financial results additionally any actual or alleged noncompliance with these laws and regulations could result in negative publicity and subject us to investigations claims or other remedies including demands that we modify or cease existing business practices and expose us to significant fines penalties and other damages we have incurred and may continue to incur significant expenses to comply with existing privacy and security standards and protocols imposed by law regulation industry standards or contractual obligations 

we are frequently a party to litigation and regulatory inquiries which could result in an unfavorable outcome and have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operation and cash flows 

we are subject to various legal proceedings including class action lawsuits claims and regulatory inquiries that have arisen out of the ordinary conduct of our business and are not yet resolved and additional claims and inquiries may arise in the future the number and significance of these claims and inquiries may increase as our businesses evolve any proceedings claims or inquiries initiated by or against us whether successful or not may be time consuming result in costly litigation damage awards consent decrees injunctive relief or increased costs of business require us to change our business practices or products require significant amounts of management time result in diversion of significant operations resources or otherwise harm our business and future financial results for further information about specific litigation see item 3 “legal proceedings” 

third parties claiming that we infringe their proprietary rights may cause us to incur significant legal expenses and prevent us from selling our products 

we may become increasingly subject to infringement claims including patent copyright trade secret and trademark infringement claims litigation may be necessary to determine the validity and scope of the intellectual property rights of others we have received a number of allegations of intellectual property infringement claims in the past and expect to receive more claims in the future based on allegations that our offerings infringe upon the intellectual property held by third parties some of these claims are the subject of pending litigation against us and against some of our customers these claims may involve patent holding companies or other adverse intellectual property owners who have no relevant product revenues of their own and against whom our own intellectual property may provide little or no deterrence the ultimate outcome of any allegation is uncertain and regardless of outcome any such claim with or without merit may be time consuming to defend result in costly litigation divert management’s time and attention from our business require us to stop selling delay shipping or redesign our products or require us to pay monetary damages for royalty or licensing fees or to satisfy indemnification obligations that we have with some of our customers our failure to obtain necessary license or other rights or litigation arising out of intellectual property claims may harm our business 

we are subject to risks associated with information disseminated through our services 

the laws relating to the liability of online services companies for information such as online content disseminated through their services are subject to frequent challenges in spite of settled law in the us claims are made against online services companies by parties who disagree with the content where our online content is accessed on the internet outside of the us challenges may be brought under foreign laws which do not provide the same protections for online services companies as in the us these challenges in either us or foreign jurisdictions may give rise to legal claims alleging defamation libel invasion 



tables of contents 

of privacy negligence copyright or trademark infringement or other theories based on the nature and content of the materials disseminated through the services certain of our services include content generated by users of our online services although this content is not generated by us claims of defamation or other injury may be made against us for that content any costs incurred as a result of this potential liability may harm our business 

financial risks 

financial risks relate to our ability to meet financial obligations and mitigate exposure to financial impacts to our businesses or our offerings financial risks arise from the following seasonality excessive product returns unanticipated changes in income tax rates adverse global macroeconomic conditions credit risks fluctuations in our net income indebtedness and the fluctuation of our stock price 

our tax business is highly seasonal and our quarterly results could fluctuate significantly 

our tax offerings have significant seasonal patterns revenue from income tax preparation products and services is heavily concentrated during november through april this seasonality has caused significant fluctuations in our quarterly financial results our financial results may also fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year due to a variety of factors including factors that may affect the timing of revenue recognition these include changes to our offerings that result in the inclusion or exclusion of ongoing services changes in product pricing strategies or product sales mix the timing of the availability of federal and state tax forms from taxing agencies and the ability of those agencies to receive electronic tax return submissions changes in customer behavior and the timing of our discontinuation of support for older product offerings other factors that may affect our quarterly or annual financial results include the timing of acquisitions divestitures and goodwill and acquired intangible asset impairment charges any fluctuations in our operating results may adversely affect our stock price 

if actual customer refunds for our offerings exceed the amount we have reserved our future financial results may be harmed 

like many software companies we refund customers for product returns and subscription cancellations we establish reserves against revenue in our financial statements based on estimated customer refunds we closely monitor this refund activity in an effort to maintain adequate reserves in the past customer refunds have not differed significantly from these reserves however if we experience actual customer refunds that significantly exceed the amount we have reserved it may result in lower net revenue 

unanticipated changes in our income tax rates or other indirect tax may affect our future financial results 

our future effective income tax rates may be favorably or unfavorably affected by unanticipated changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities by changes in our stock price or by changes in tax laws or their interpretation including the recently passed the tax cuts and jobs act 2017 tax act the 2017 tax act introduces significant changes to us income tax law accounting for the income tax effects of the 2017 tax act requires significant judgments and estimates as well as accumulation of information not previously provided for in us tax law as additional regulatory guidance is issued by the applicable taxing authorities our analysis may change which could materially affect our tax obligations and effective tax rate further foreign governments may enact tax laws in response to the 2017 tax act that could result in further changes to global taxation and materially affect our financial position and results of operations in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes these continuous examinations may result in unforeseen taxrelated liabilities which may harm our future financial results 

an increasing number of states and foreign jurisdictions have adopted laws or administrative practices that impose new taxes on all or a portion of gross revenue or other similar amounts or impose additional obligations to collect transaction taxes such as sales consumption value added or similar taxes we may not have sufficient lead time to build systems and processes to collect these taxes properly or at all failure to comply with such laws or administrative practices or a successful assertion by such states or foreign jurisdictions requiring us to collect taxes where we do not could result in tax liabilities including for past sales as well as penalties and interest 

adverse global economic conditions could harm our business and financial condition 

adverse macroeconomic developments could negatively affect our business and financial condition adverse global economic events have caused and could in the future cause disruptions and volatility in global financial markets and increased rates of default and bankruptcy and could impact consumer and small business spending while we have historically performed well in economic downturns there is no guarantee that we would continue to perform well in future adverse macroeconomic conditions in particular because the majority of our revenue is derived from sales within the us economic conditions in the us have an even greater impact on us than companies with a more diverse international presence challenging economic times could cause potential new customers not to purchase or to delay purchasing our products and services and could cause our existing customers to discontinue purchasing or delay upgrades of our existing products and services thereby negatively impacting our revenues and future financial results decreased consumer spending levels could also reduce credit and debit 



tables of contents 

card transaction processing volumes causing reductions in our payments revenue poor economic conditions and high unemployment have caused and could in the future cause a significant decrease in the number of tax returns filed which may have a significant effect on the number of tax returns we prepare and file in addition weakness in the enduser consumer and small business markets could negatively affect the cash flow of our distributors and resellers who could in turn delay paying their obligations to us which could increase our credit risk exposure and cause delays in our recognition of revenue or future sales to these customers any of these events could harm our business and our future financial results 

we provide capital to small businesses which exposes us to credit risk and may cause us material financial or reputational harm 

we provide capital to qualified small businesses which exposes us to the risk of our borrowers’ inability to repay such loans further our credit decisioning pricing loss forecasting and scoring models used to evaluate loan applications may contain errors or may not adequately assess creditworthiness of our borrowers or may be otherwise ineffective resulting in incorrect approvals or denials of loans it is also possible that loan applicants could provide false or incorrect information while we have not incurred any material losses to date if any of the foregoing events were to occur our reputation and relationships with borrowers and our financial results could be harmed 

amortization of acquired intangible assets and impairment charges may cause significant fluctuation in our net income 

our acquisitions have resulted in significant expenses including amortization and impairment of acquired technology and other acquired intangible assets and impairment of goodwill total costs and expenses in these categories were 21 million in fiscal 2018 14 million in fiscal 2017 and 34 million in fiscal 2016 although under current accounting rules goodwill is not amortized we may incur impairment charges related to the goodwill already recorded and to goodwill arising out of future acquisitions we test the impairment of goodwill annually in our fourth fiscal quarter or more frequently if indicators of impairment arise the timing of the formal annual test may result in charges to our statement of operations in our fourth fiscal quarter that may not have been reasonably foreseen in prior periods at july 31 2018  we had 16 billion in goodwill and 61 million in net acquired intangible assets on our balance sheet both of which may be subject to impairment charges in the future new acquisitions and any impairment of the value of acquired intangible assets may have a significant negative impact on our future financial results 

we have 438 million in debt outstanding under the term loan and may incur other debt in the future which may adversely affect our financial condition and future financial results 

on february 1 2016 we entered into a master credit agreement with certain institutional lenders for a new fiveyear credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of 15 billion the master credit agreement includes a 500 million unsecured term loan and a 1 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that will expire on february 1 2021 as of july 31 2018  438 million was outstanding on the term loan and no amounts were outstanding under the revolving credit facility we may use the proceeds of any advances against the credit facility for general corporate purposes including future acquisitions and share repurchases

in fiscal 2015 intuit was contacted by certain state and federal regulatory authorities in connection with inquiries regarding an increase during the 2015 tax season in attempts by criminals using stolen identity information to file fraudulent tax returns and claim refunds intuit provided information in response to those inquiries and now believes those inquiries are resolved 

a consolidated putative class action lawsuit was filed by individuals who claim to have suffered damages in connection with the 2015 events on may 23 2018 the parties reached a settlement in principle of this matter which is subject to preliminary and final approval by the court on august 23 2018 the parties filed a motion for preliminary approval of the settlement a preliminary approval hearing is scheduled to be heard on october 4 2018 the terms of the proposed settlement are not material to our consolidated financial statements in the event the settlement does not receive final approval by the court the litigation may resume and we may not be able to predict the outcome of such lawsuit we continue to believe that the allegations in this lawsuit are without merit 

intuit is subject to certain routine legal proceedings including class action lawsuits like the suit described above as well as demands claims government inquiries and threatened litigation that arise in the normal course of our business including assertions that we may be infringing patents or other intellectual property rights of others we currently believe that in addition to any amounts accrued the amount of potential losses if any for any pending claims of any type either alone or combined will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements the ultimate outcome of any litigation is uncertain and regardless of outcome litigation can have an adverse impact on intuit because of defense costs negative publicity diversion of management resources and other factors our failure to obtain necessary license or other rights or litigation arising out of intellectual property claims could adversely affect our business

tableend

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda is intended to provide readers of our consolidated financial statements with the perspectives of management this should allow the readers of this report to obtain a comprehensive understanding of our businesses strategies current trends and future prospects our mda includes the following sections 

you should note that this mda contains forwardlooking statements that involve risks and uncertainties please see the section entitled “forwardlooking statements” immediately preceding part 1 for important information to consider when evaluating such statements 

you should read this mda in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes in item 8 of this annual report in fiscal 2018 we acquired tsheetscom llc exactor inc and applatix inc we have included their results of operations in our consolidated results of operations from the dates of acquisitions 

in august 2017 we aligned our segment reporting for fiscal 2018 with our core customers and business partners the consumer ecosystem offering moved from the small business segment into the consumer tax segment the company also renamed the small business consumer tax and proconnect segments as the small business  selfemployed consumer and strategic partner segments respectively the strategic partner segment will continue to manage our professional tax offerings we have reclassified certain amounts related to our reportable segments previously reported in our financial statements to conform to the current presentation see note 14 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report for more information 

in fiscal 2016 we completed the sales of our demandforce quickbase and quicken businesses we have reclassified our statements of operations for fiscal 2016 to reflect all of these businesses as discontinued operations because the cash flows of these discontinued operations were not material  we have not segregated them on our statements of cash flows see “results of operations – nonoperating income and expense – discontinued operations” later in this item 7 for more information unless otherwise noted the following discussion pertains to our continuing operations 



this overview provides a high level discussion of our operating results and some of the trends that affect our business we believe that an understanding of these trends is important in order to understand our financial results for fiscal 2018 as well as our future prospects this summary is not intended to be exhaustive nor is it a substitute for the detailed discussion and analysis provided elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 



industry trends 

the rapid expansion of cloudbased services is creating a more dynamic and highly competitive software industry high availability and speed of service are reshaping customer expectations around the world these shifts are accelerating product introductions and enhancements among cloudbased service companies free business models and microjob solutions are also becoming more prevalent within the industry personalization and datadriven insights augmented by artificial intelligence and machine learning are transforming the way that people manage their financial lives 

seasonality 

our consumer offerings have significant seasonal patterns as a result during each of the last three fiscal years the total consolidated revenue for our third quarter ended april 30 has represented nearly half of our annual total consolidated revenue for those years we expect the seasonality of our consumer business to continue to have a significant impact on our quarterly financial results in the future 



tables of contents 



our growth strategy depends upon our ability to initiate and embrace disruptive technology trends to enter new markets and to drive broad adoption of the products and services we develop and market our future growth also increasingly depends on the strength of our thirdparty business relationships and our ability to continue to develop maintain and strengthen new and existing relationships to remain competitive and continue to grow we are investing significant resources in our product development marketing and sales capabilities and we expect to continue to do so in the future 

as we offer more online services the ongoing operation and availability of our platforms and systems and those of our external service providers is becoming increasingly important because we help customers manage their financial lives we face risks associated with the hosting collection use and retention of personal customer information and data we are investing significant management attention and resources in our information technology infrastructure and in our privacy and security capabilities and we expect to continue to do so in the future 

for our consumer and professional tax offerings we have implemented additional security measures and are continuing to work with state and federal governments to share information regarding suspicious filings we continue to invest in security measures and to work with the broader industry and government to protect our customers against this type of fraud 

for a complete discussion of the most significant risks and uncertainties affecting our business please see “forwardlooking statements” immediately preceding part 1 and “risk factors” in item 1a of part i of this report 



the most important financial indicators that we use to assess our business are revenue growth for the company as a whole for each reportable segment and for product lines within each reportable segment operating income growth and operating income margins for the company as a whole and for each reportable segment earnings per share and cash flow from operations we also track certain nonfinancial drivers of revenue growth and when material identify them in the applicable discussions of segment results below these nonfinancial drivers include for example customer growth and retention for all of our businesses online service offerings are a significant part of our business our total service and other revenue was 45 billion or 75 of our total revenue in fiscal 2018 and we expect our total service and other revenue to continue to grow in the future 

key highlights for fiscal 2018 include the following 





tables of contents 



in preparing our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap we are required to make estimates assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on our net revenue operating income or loss and net income or loss as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our balance sheet we believe that the estimates assumptions and judgments involved in the following accounting policies have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies 

 our senior management has reviewed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and their disclosure in this annual report on form 10k with the audit and risk committee of our board of directors 

revenue recognition 

we derive revenue from the sale of software subscriptions hosted services packaged software products financial supplies technical support plans transaction fees merchant services hardware and multiple element arrangements that may include a combination of these items we follow the appropriate revenue recognition rules for each type of revenue for additional information see “revenue recognition” in note 1 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report we generally recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists we have delivered the product or performed the service the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable however determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves exercising judgment and using estimates that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report for example for multiple element arrangements containing only software and softwarerelated elements we must exercise judgment and use estimates in order to 1 allocate the total price among the various elements we must deliver 2 determine whether undelivered services are essential to the functionality of the delivered products and services 3 determine whether vendorspecific evidence of fair value exists for each undelivered element and 4 determine whether and when each element has been delivered for multiple element arrangements containing nonsoftware elements we must exercise judgment and use estimates in order to 1 determine whether and when each element has been delivered 2 determine the fair value of each element using the selling price hierarchy of vendorspecific evidence of fair value vsoe if available thirdparty evidence tpe if vsoe is not available and estimated selling price esp if neither vsoe nor tpe is available and 3 allocate the total price among the various elements based on the relative selling price method if we were to change any of these judgments or estimates it could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period amounts for fees collected or invoiced and due relating to arrangements where revenue cannot be recognized are reflected on our balance sheet as deferred revenue and recognized when the applicable revenue recognition criteria are satisfied 

business combinations 

as described in “description of business and summary of significant accounting policies – business combinations” in note 1 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report under the acquisition method of accounting we generally recognize the identifiable assets acquired the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interests in an acquiree at their fair values as of the date of acquisition we measure goodwill as the excess of consideration transferred which we also measure at fair value over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed the acquisition method of accounting requires us to exercise judgment and make significant estimates and assumptions regarding the fair values of the elements of a business combination as of the date of acquisition including the fair values of identifiable intangible assets deferred tax asset valuation allowances liabilities related to uncertain tax positions and contingencies this method also requires us to refine these estimates over a oneyear measurement period to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that if known would have affected the measurement of the amounts recognized as of that date if we are required to retroactively adjust provisional amounts that we have recorded for the fair values of assets and liabilities in connection with acquisitions these adjustments could materially decrease our operating income and net income and result in lower asset values on our balance sheet 

significant estimates and assumptions that we must make in estimating the fair value of acquired technology customer lists and other identifiable intangible assets include future cash flows that we expect to generate from the acquired assets if the subsequent actual results and updated projections of the underlying business activity change compared with the assumptions and projections used to develop these values we could record impairment charges in addition we have estimated the economic lives of certain acquired assets and these lives are used to calculate depreciation and amortization expense if our estimates of the economic lives change depreciation or amortization expenses could be accelerated or slowed

goodwill acquired intangible assets and other longlived assets – impairment assessments 

we estimate the fair value of acquired intangible assets and other longlived assets that have finite useful lives whenever an event or change in circumstances indicates that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable we test for potential impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives annually in our fourth fiscal quarter or whenever indicators of impairment arise the timing of the annual test may result in charges to our statement of operations in our fourth fiscal quarter that could not have been reasonably foreseen in prior periods 

as described in “description of business and summary of significant accounting policies – goodwill acquired intangible assets and other longlived assets” in note 1 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report in order to estimate the fair value of goodwill we use a weighted combination of a discounted cash flow model known as the income approach and comparisons to publicly traded companies engaged in similar businesses known as the market approach the income approach requires us to use a number of assumptions including market factors specific to the business the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows to be generated by the business over an extended period of time longterm growth rates for the business and a rate of return that considers the relative risk of achieving the cash flows and the time value of money we evaluate cash flows at the reporting unit level although the assumptions we use in our discounted cash flow model are consistent with the assumptions we use to generate our internal strategic plans and forecasts significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of future cash flows from each reporting unit and the relative risk of achieving those cash flows when using the market approach we make judgments about the comparability of publicly traded companies engaged in similar businesses we base our judgments on factors such as size growth rates profitability risk and return on investment we also make judgments when adjusting market multiples of revenue operating income and earnings for these companies to reflect their relative similarity to our own businesses we had a total of 16 billion in goodwill on our balance sheet at july 31 2018  see note 5 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report for a summary of goodwill by reportable segment 

we estimate the recoverability of acquired intangible assets and other longlived assets that have finite useful lives by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows that we expect the asset to generate in order to estimate the fair value of those assets we estimate the present value of future cash flows from those assets the key assumptions that we use in our discounted cash flow model are the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows to be generated by the asset over an extended period of time and a rate of return that considers the relative risk of achieving the cash flows and the time value of money significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of future cash flows and the relative risk of achieving those cash flows we also make judgments about the remaining useful lives of acquired intangible assets and other longlived assets that have finite lives we had a total of 61 million in net acquired intangible assets on our balance sheet at july 31 2018  

assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives are complex and often subjective they can be affected by a variety of factors including external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts for example if our future operating results do not meet current forecasts or if we experience a sustained decline in our market capitalization that is determined to be indicative of a reduction in fair value of one or more of our reporting units we may be required to record future impairment charges for goodwill and acquired intangible assets impairment charges could materially decrease our future net income and result in lower asset values on our balance sheet 

during the fourth quarters of fiscal 2018  fiscal 2017  and fiscal 2016 we performed our annual goodwill impairment tests using the methodology described in “description of business and summary of significant accounting policies – goodwill acquired intangible assets and other longlived assets” in note 1 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report we determined that the estimated fair values of all of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values and that they were not impaired in addition during this analysis we concluded that the estimated fair values of all of our reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying values 

accounting for sharebased compensation plans 

at july 31 2018  there was 882 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested sharebased compensation arrangements granted under all equity compensation plans which we will amortize to expense in the future we expect to recognize that cost over a weighted average vesting period of 27 years 

we use a lattice binomial model and the assumptions described in note 11 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report to estimate the fair value of stock options granted we estimate the expected term of options granted based on implied exercise patterns using a binomial model we estimate the volatility of our common stock at the date of grant based on the implied volatility of publicly traded oneyear and twoyear options on our common stock our decision to use implied volatility is based upon the availability of actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility we base the riskfree interest rate that we use in our option valuation model on the implied yield in effect at the time of option grant on constant maturity us treasury issues with equivalent remaining terms we use an annualized expected dividend yield in our option valuation model we adjust sharebased compensation expense for actual forfeitures as they occur prior to our adoption of asu 201609 in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 we estimated forfeitures at the time of grant and revised those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differed from those estimates we amortize the fair value of options on a straightline basis over the requisite 



tables of contents 

service periods of the awards which are generally the vesting periods we may elect to use different assumptions under our option valuation model in the future which could materially affect our net income or loss and net income or loss per share 

restricted stock units rsus granted typically vest based on continued service we value these timebased rsus at the date of grant using the intrinsic value method we amortize the fair value of timebased rsus on a straightline basis over the service period certain rsus granted to senior management vest based on the achievement of preestablished performance or market goals we estimate the fair value of performancebased rsus at the date of grant using the intrinsic value method and the probability that the specified performance criteria will be met each quarter we update our assessment of the probability that the specified performance criteria will be achieved and adjust our estimate of the fair value of the performancebased rsus if necessary we amortize the fair values of performancebased rsus over the requisite service period for each separately vesting tranche of the award we estimate the fair value of marketbased rsus at the date of grant using a monte carlo valuation methodology and amortize those fair values over the requisite service period for each separately vesting tranche of the award the monte carlo methodology that we use to estimate the fair value of marketbased rsus at the date of grant incorporates into the valuation the possibility that the market condition may not be satisfied provided that the requisite service is rendered the total fair value of the marketbased rsus at the date of grant must be recognized as compensation expense even if the market condition is not achieved however the number of shares that ultimately vest can vary significantly with the performance of the specified market criteria all of the rsus we grant have dividend rights that are subject to the same vesting requirements as the underlying equity awards so we do not adjust the intrinsic market value of our rsus for dividends see note 11 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report for more information 

legal contingencies 

we are subject to certain legal proceedings as well as demands claims and threatened litigation that arise in the normal course of our business we review the status of each significant matter quarterly and assess our potential financial exposure if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated we record a liability and an expense for the estimated loss if we determine that a loss is possible and the range of the loss can be reasonably determined then we disclose the range of the possible loss significant judgment is required in the determination of whether a potential loss is probable reasonably possible or remote as well as in the determination of whether a potential exposure is reasonably estimable our accruals are based on the best information available at the time as additional information becomes available we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates potential legal liabilities and the revision of estimates of potential legal liabilities could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 

accounting for income taxes – estimates of deferred taxes valuation allowances and uncertain tax positions 

we estimate our income taxes based on the various jurisdictions where we conduct business significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax rules and the potential for future adjustment of our uncertain tax positions by the united states internal revenue service or other taxing jurisdictions we estimate our current tax liability and assess temporary differences that result from differing treatments of certain items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which we show on our balance sheet we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized to the extent we believe that realization is not likely we establish a valuation allowance when we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in an accounting period we record a corresponding tax expense in our statement of operations 

at july 31 2018  we had net deferred tax assets of 80 million which included a valuation allowance of 93 million for loss and tax credit carryforwards related to state research and experimentation tax credits foreign losses and state operating and capital losses we recorded the valuation allowance to reflect uncertainties about whether we will be able to utilize some of our deferred tax assets before they expire while we believe our current valuation allowance is sufficient we could in the future be required to increase the valuation allowance to take into account additional deferred tax assets that we may be unable to realize we assess the need for an adjustment to the valuation allowance on a quarterly basis the assessment is based on our estimates of future sources of taxable income for the jurisdictions in which we operate and the periods over which our deferred tax assets will be realizable see note 10 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report for more information 

we recognize and measure benefits for uncertain tax positions using a twostep approach the first step is to evaluate the tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon audit including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes for tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely of being realized upon settlement significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions we evaluate our uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis our evaluations are based upon a number of factors including changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law correspondence with tax authorities during the course of audits and effective settlement of audit issues changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in material increases or decreases in our income tax expense in the period in which we make the change which could have a material impact on our effective tax rate and operating results

effective tax rate 

the tax cuts and jobs act 2017 tax act was enacted on december 22 2017 and reduces the us statutory federal corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 the effective date of the tax rate change was january 1 2018 the change resulted in a blended lower us statutory federal rate of 269 for fiscal year 2018 as a result we adjusted our annual effective tax rate for the year ended july 31 2018 as well as adjusted our us net deferred tax asset balance at the lower rates 

our effective tax rates for fiscal 2018  fiscal 2017  and fiscal 2016 were approximately 19  29  and 33  excluding the tax benefits related to sharebased compensation the reorganization of a subsidiary and the charge related to the remeasurement of our deferred tax asset balances our effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 was approximately 26 and did not differ significantly from the federal statutory rate of 269 excluding the sharebased compensation tax benefits our effective tax rate for fiscal 2017 was approximately 34 and did not differ significantly from the federal statutory rate of 35 see note 10 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report for more information about our effective tax rates

 item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend

investment portfolio and interest rate risk 

we actively monitor market conditions and developments specific to the securities in which we invest we believe that we take a conservative approach to investing our funds in that we invest only in highlyrated securities and diversify our portfolio of investments while we believe we take prudent measures to mitigate investmentrelated risks such risks cannot be fully eliminated because of market circumstances that are outside our control 

our investments consist of instruments that meet quality standards that are consistent with our investment policy this policy specifies that except for direct obligations of the united states government securities issued by agencies of the united states government and money market funds we diversify our investments by limiting our holdings with any individual issuer we do not hold derivative financial instruments or european sovereign debt in our portfolio of investments see note 2 and note 3 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report for a summary of the amortized cost and fair value of our investments by type of issue 

our cash equivalents and investments are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates interest rate movements affect the interest income we earn on cash equivalents and investments and the value of those investments at july 31 2018  our cash equivalents and investments totaled 16 billion and had a weighted average pretax yield of 185  total interest income for fiscal 2018 was 18 million  if the federal reserve target rate had increased by 25 basis points from the level of july 31 2018  the value of our investments at that date would have decreased by approximately 1 million if the federal reserve target rate had increased by 100 basis points from the level of july 31 2018  the value of our investments at that date would have decreased by approximately 4 million 

we are also exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates as they affect our 1 billion unsecured revolving credit facility and 500 million unsecured term loan advances under the revolving credit facility accrue interest at rates that are equal to bank of america’s alternate base rate plus a margin that ranges from 00 to 05 or the london interbank offered rate libor plus a margin that ranges from 09 to 15  the term loan accrues interest at rates that are equal to at our election either bank of americas alternate base rate plus a margin that ranges from 0125 to 0875 or libor plus a margin that ranges from 1125 to 1875 actual margins under all of these elections are based on our senior debt credit ratings consequently our interest expense fluctuates with changes in the general level of these interest rates at july 31 2018 no amounts were outstanding under the revolving credit facility and 438 million was outstanding under the term loan see note 8 and note 9 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report for more information 

impact of foreign currency rate changes 

the functional currencies of our international operating subsidiaries are generally the local currencies we translate the assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries at the exchange rates in effect on the balance sheet date we translate their revenue costs and expenses at the average rates of exchange in effect during the period we include translation gains and losses in the stockholders’ equity section of our balance sheets we include net gains and losses resulting from foreign exchange transactions in interest and other income in our statements of operations 

since we translate foreign currencies primarily canadian dollars indian rupees and british pounds into us dollars for financial reporting purposes currency fluctuations can have an impact on our financial results the historical impact of currency fluctuations on our financial results has generally been immaterial we believe that our exposure to currency exchange fluctuation risk is not significant because our global subsidiaries invoice customers and satisfy their financial obligations almost exclusively in their local currencies we believe the impact of currency fluctuations will continue to not be significant in the future due to the reasons cited above however the impact of currency fluctuations could be material in the future as of july 31 2018  we did not engage in foreign currency hedging activities

based upon an evaluation of the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures intuit’s chief executive officer ceo and chief financial officer cfo have concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on form 10k our disclosure controls and procedures as defined under exchange act rules 13a15e and 15d15e were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our exchange act reports is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the securities and exchange commission and is accumulated and communicated to management including the ceo and cfo as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in exchange act rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of july 31 2018 based on the guidelines established in internal control – integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso based on the results of this evaluation our management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of july 31 2018 to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles we reviewed the results of management’s assessment with the audit and risk committee of intuit’s board of directors 

ernst  young llp an independent registered public accounting firm has audited the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of july 31 2018  their report is included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

during our most recent fiscal quarter there has not occurred any change in our internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls 

our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer believes that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and that they are effective at the reasonable assurance level however no matter how well conceived and executed a control system can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met the design of any control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs there are also limitations that are inherent in any control system these limitations include the realities that breakdowns can occur because of errors in judgment or mistakes and that controls can be circumvented by individual persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls because of these inherent limitations in a cost effective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected

since the markets for software and related services are characterized by rapid technological change shifting customer needs and frequent new product introductions and enhancements a continuous high level of investment is required to innovate and quickly develop new products and services as well as enhance existing offerings our product development efforts are becoming more important than ever as we pursue our growth strategy 

we develop many of our products and services internally and we have a number of united states and foreign patents and pending applications that relate to various aspects of our products and technology we also supplement our internal development efforts by acquiring or licensing products and technology from third parties and establishing other relationships that enable us to enhance or expand our offerings more rapidly we expect to expand our thirdparty technology relationships as we continue to pursue our growth strategy 

while our traditional desktop software products – quickbooks turbotax lacerte and proseries – tend to have predictable annual development and product release cycles as we move to more online offerings and mobile applications the development cycles are becoming more rapid in addition developing consumer and professional tax software and services presents unique challenges because of the demanding development cycle required to accurately incorporate federal and state tax law and tax form changes within a rigid timetable the development timing for our small business payroll and merchant payment processing services offerings varies with business needs and regulatory requirements and the length of the development cycle depends on the scope and complexity of each project 

we continue to make substantial investments in research and development and we expect to focus our future research and development efforts on enhancing existing products and services and on developing new products and services including new 

tables of contents 

mobile and global offerings we also expect to continue to focus significant research and development efforts on ongoing projects to update the technology platforms for several of our offerings our research and development expenses were 998 million or 19 of total net revenue in fiscal 2017  881 million or 19 of total net revenue in fiscal 2016  and 798 million or 19 of total net revenue in fiscal 2015  



our consumer tax offerings have significant seasonal patterns as a result during each of the last three fiscal years the total revenue for our third quarter ended april 30 has represented nearly half of our total revenue for those years we expect the seasonality of our consumer tax business to continue to have a significant impact on our quarterly financial results in the future 



markets 

our primary target customers are consumers small businesses and the selfemployed we also provide specialized tax products to accounting professionals who are key partners to help us reach small business customers the markets in which we compete have always been characterized by rapid technological change shifting customer needs and frequent new product introductions and enhancements by competitors over the past several years the widespread availability of the internet mobile devices and the explosion of social media have accelerated the pace of change and revolutionized the way that customers learn about evaluate and purchase products and services 

realtime personalized online and mobile shopping experiences have become the standard in addition many customers now begin shopping in one channel and ultimately purchase in another this has created a need for integrated multichannel shopandbuy experiences market and industry changes quickly make existing products and services obsolete our success depends on our ability to respond rapidly to these changes with new business models updated competitive strategies new or enhanced products and services alternative distribution methods and other changes in the way we do business 

marketing programs 

we use a variety of traditional and innovative marketing programs to generate orders stimulate demand and generally maintain and increase customer awareness of our product portfolio these programs include digital marketing and targeted advertising such as search engine optimization and purchasing keywords from major search engine companies placing and promoting our mobile applications in proprietary online stores directresponse mail and email campaigns telephone solicitations newspaper magazine billboard radio and television advertising social media campaigns and coordinated promotional offers with major retailers we also use workflowintegrated inproduct discovery in some of our offerings to market other related products and services including thirdparty products and services in addition we create marketing campaigns that are designed to attract new users through trial promotional offerings 

sales and distribution channels 

multichannel shopandbuy experiences  our customers increasingly use the internet and mobile devices to research products and services some customers buy and use our products and services entirely online or through their mobile devices others purchase desktop products and services using the internet still others make their final decision at a retail location although retail sales of our products and services are gradually declining as online distribution channels grow in importance we continue to coordinate our websites promotions and retail displays to support an integrated multichannel shopandbuy model 

direct sales channel  we sell many of our products and services directly through our websites and call centers telesales continues to be an effective channel for serving customers that want live help to select the products and services that are right for their needs we also have a direct sales force that calls on us and international accountant firms and seeks to increase their awareness usage and recommendation of our small business solutions 

retail channel  we sell our quickbooks and turbotax desktop software as well as payroll services and merchant credit card payment processing services at retail locations across the united states we sell these products and services directly and through distributors to office supply superstores warehouse clubs consumer electronics retailers general mass merchandisers online retailers and catalogs in canada and the united kingdom we also rely on distributors and other third parties who sell products into the retail channel the retail channel provides broad customer reach through retailersponsored advertising and exposure to retail foot traffic this channel also gives us the opportunity to communicate our products services and messages through multiple touch points and allows us to serve our customers at relatively modest cost 

mobile application stores  we distribute many of our offerings for mobile devices through proprietary online stores that provide applications for specific devices these include the apple app store which provides apps for the apple iphone and ipad and google’s play store which provides apps for androidcompatible smartphones and tablets 

tables of contents 

other channels  we sell our consumer and small business products and services through selected alliance partners and accountants that help us reach new customers at the point of need and drive growth and market share by extending our online reach solution providers combine our products and services with valueadded marketing sales and technical expertise to deliver a complete solution at the local level as we expand our mobile and global offerings we expect that strategic partnerships will become increasingly important to our business 



overview 

we face intense competition in all of our businesses both domestically and internationally competitive interest and expertise in many of the markets we serve have grown markedly over the past few years and we expect this trend to continue some of our existing competitors have significantly greater financial technical and marketing resources than we do in addition the competitive landscape can shift rapidly as new companies enter markets in which we compete this is particularly true for online and mobile products and services where the barriers to entry are lower than they are for desktop software products and services to attract customers many online and mobile competitors are offering free or lowpriced products which we must take into account in our pricing strategies 

our most obvious competition comes from other companies that offer technology solutions similar to ours however for many of our products and services other important competitive alternatives for customers are thirdparty service providers such as professional accountants and seasonal assisted tax preparation businesses manual tools and processes or generalpurpose software are also important competitive alternatives 

competition specific to segments 

small business segment  quickbooks is the leading small business financial management software in the us our small business desktop products and services face competitive challenges from companies such as the sage group plc which offers software and associated services that directly target small business customers our small business online products and services face competition from online accounting offerings from companies such as xero and freshbooks free or lowcost online accounting offerings and free online banking and bill payment services offered by financial institutions and others in our payroll business we compete directly with automatic data processing inc adp paychex gusto and many other companies with payroll offerings including online payroll offerings in our merchant services business we compete directly with large financial institutions such as wells fargo jp morgan chase and bank of america and with many payment processors including first data corporation elavon global payments fis paypal and square 

consumer tax segment  in our consumer tax segment our future growth depends on our ability to attract new customers to the selfpreparation tax category from tax stores and other tax preparers in the us private sector we face intense competition from hr block which provides tax preparation services in its stores and a competing software offering we also face competition from several other large tax preparation service providers from a myriad of small tax preparers and from numerous online selfpreparation offerings including blucora’s taxact and credit karma some of these competitors are offering electronic tax preparation and filing services at no cost to individual taxpayers in canada our turbotax canada offerings face competition from hr block simpletax studiotax and ufile these competing offerings subject us to significant price pressure in both the us and canada 

we also face competitive challenges from publicly funded government entities that offer electronic tax preparation and filing services at no cost to individual taxpayers we are a member of the free file alliance a consortium of private sector companies that has entered into an agreement with the federal government under this agreement the member companies provide online federal tax preparation and filing services at no cost to the public or eligible federal taxpayers and the federal government has agreed not to provide a competing service approximately 22 states have also adopted free file alliance publicprivate agreements while approximately 20 other states offer some form of direct government tax preparation and filing services free to qualified taxpayers we continue to actively work with others in the private and public sectors to advance the goals of the free file alliance policy initiative and to support successful publicprivate partnerships however future administrative regulatory or legislative activity in this area could harm our consumer tax business 

proconnect segment  in the us lacerte professional tax offerings face competition from competitivelypriced tax and accounting solutions that include integration with nontax functionality these include cch’s prosystems fx office suite and thomson reuters’ cs professional suite and gosystems tax our proseries professional tax offerings face competition from cch’s atx and taxwise offerings drake and other smaller providers in canada our profile professional tax offerings face competition from cch’s cantax and taxprep offerings and from thomson reuters’ dtmax and ufile pro offerings we also face growing competition from online tax and accounting offerings in the us and canada which may be marketed more effectively or have lower pricing than our offerings for accounting professionals 

competitive factors 

we believe the most important competitive factors for our core offerings – quickbooks turbotax lacerte and proseries – are ease of use product features size of the installed customer base brand name recognition value proposition cost reliability 

tables of contents 

security and product and support quality access to distribution channels is also important for our quickbooks and turbotax desktop software products in addition support from accounting professionals and the ability for customers to upgrade within product families as their businesses grow are significant competitive factors for our quickbooks products productivity is an important competitive factor for the fullservice accounting firms to which we market our lacerte software products we believe we compete effectively on these factors as our quickbooks and turbotax products are the leading products in the us for their respective categories 

for our service offerings such as small business payroll and merchant payment processing we believe the most important competitive factors are functionality ease of use high availability security the integration of these products with related software brand name recognition effective distribution quality of support and cost 



we provide customer service and technical support by telephone email online and video chat text messaging online communities and our customer service and technical support websites we have fulltime and outsourced customer service and technical support staffs we supplement these staffs with seasonal employees and additional outsourcing during periods of peak call volumes such as during the tax return filing season or following a major product launch we outsource to several firms domestically and internationally most of our internationally outsourced small business customer service and technical support personnel are currently located in india and the philippines 

we offer free selfhelp information through our technical support websites for our quickbooks turbotax and proconnect offerings customers can also use our websites to find answers to commonly asked questions and check on the status of orders under certain paid support plans customers can also use our websites to receive product updates electronically support alternatives and fees vary by product we sponsor online user communities such as intuit community for small businesses and accounting professionals and turbotax answerxchange where consumers can share knowledge and product advice with each other we also offer live tax advice from usbased tax professionals to us turbotax users 



online products and services 

intuit’s data centers house most of the systems networks and databases required to operate and deliver our online products and services these include quickbooks online online payroll services merchant payment processing services turbotax online proconnect tax online and consumer and professional electronic tax filing services through our data centers we connect customers to our products and services and store customer and business information as our businesses continue to move toward delivering personalized experiences trusted open platforms and indispensable connections we expect that our infrastructure will become even more critical to our business in the future 

our primary data centers are a facility we own in washington state and a colocated data center in nevada we also have a number of other data centers that are primarily located in the western united states and canada we continue to execute on a multiyear plan to transition to fewer data centers in more geographically diverse locations in addition we have an enterprise agreement with amazon web services and over time will be hosting an increasing number of our applications and services in their secure online environment 

desktop software and supplies 

although an increasing proportion of our desktop software customers choose to electronically download software many customers continue to choose to purchase these products in the form of physical media the key processes in manufacturing desktop software are manufacturing compact discs cds and digital video discs dvds printing boxes and related materials and assembling and shipping the final products 

for retail manufacturing we have an agreement with arvato digital services inc a division of bertelsmann ag under which arvato provides a majority of the manufacturing volume for our launches of quickbooks and turbotax as well as for daytoday replenishment after product launches arvato has operations in multiple locations that can provide redundancy if necessary 

for retail distribution we have an agreement with arvato under which arvato handles all logistics services our retail product launches are operationally complex our model for product delivery for retail launches and replenishment is a hybrid of direct to store deliveries and shipments to central warehouse locations this allows improved inventory management by our retailers we also ship products for many of our smaller retail customers through distributors 

arvato also provides most of the manufacturing volume and distribution services for our direct desktop software orders we have an exclusive agreement with harland clarke a division of mf worldwide corporation to fulfill orders for all of our printed checks and most other products for our financial supplies business 

tables of contents 

we have multiple sources for all of our raw materials and availability has historically not been a significant problem for us we continue to see consolidation among cddvd suppliers and reduced demand overall for this media type as a result we believe cddvd media may become more difficult and more costly to obtain in the near future 

we typically ship products within a few days of receiving an order and backlog is minimal 



we are subject to various federal state and international laws and regulations and to financial institution and healthcare provider requirements relating to the privacy and security of customer and employee personal information we are also subject to laws and regulations that apply to the internet behavioral tracking and advertising mobile applications and messaging telemarketing email activities data transfer data hosting and retention financial and health information financial transactions and credit reporting additional laws in all of these areas are likely to be passed in the future which could result in significant limitations on or changes to the ways in which we can collect use host store or transmit the personal information and data of our customers or employees communicate with our customers and deliver products and services to customers or employees or may significantly increase our compliance costs as our business expands to new industry segments and new uses of data that are regulated for privacy and security or to countries outside the united states that have strict data protections laws our compliance requirements and costs will increase 

we are the stewards of our customers’ data through a master privacy policy framework designed to be consistent with globally recognized privacy principles we comply with united states federal and other country guidelines and practices to help ensure that customers and employees are aware of and can control how we use information about them our primary websites and online products such as intuitcom quickbooks and turbotax have been certified by truste an independent organization that operates a website and online product privacy certification program representing industry standard practices to address users’ and regulators’ concerns about online privacy we also use privacy statements to provide notice to customers of our privacy practices as well as provide them the opportunity to furnish instructions with respect to use of their personal information we participate in industry groups whose purpose is to develop or shape industry best practices and to influence public policy for privacy and security 

to address security concerns we use security safeguards to help protect the systems and the information customers and employees give to us from loss misuse and unauthorized alteration whenever customers transmit sensitive information such as credit card information or tax return data through one of our websites or products we use industry standards to encrypt the data as it is transmitted to us we work to protect our systems from unauthorized internal or external access using numerous commercially available computer security products as well as internally developed security procedures and practices 



our consumer tax and proconnect segments are subject to federal and state government requirements including regulations related to the electronic filing of tax returns the provision of tax preparer assistance and the use and disclosure of customer information in addition we offer certain other products and services to small businesses and consumers such as payroll payments and financing which are also subject to regulatory requirements as we expand our products and services both domestically and internationally we may become subject to additional government regulation further regulators may adopt new laws or regulations or their interpretation of existing laws or regulations may differ from ours or expand to cover additional products and services these increased regulatory requirements could impose significant limitations on our business and increase our cost of compliance 

we are subject to federal and state laws and government regulations concerning employee safety and health and environmental matters the occupational safety and health administration the environmental protection agency and other federal and state agencies have the authority to put regulations in place that may have an impact on our operations 

tables of contents 



our success depends on the proprietary technology embodied in our offerings we protect this proprietary technology by relying on a variety of intellectual property mechanisms including copyright patent trade secret and trademark laws restrictions on disclosure and other methods for example we regularly file applications for patents copyrights and trademarks and service marks in order to protect intellectual property that we believe is important to our business we hold a growing patent portfolio that we believe is important to intuit’s overall competitive advantage although we are not materially dependent on any one patent or particular group of patents in our portfolio at this time we also have a number of registered trademarks that include intuit quickbooks turbotax lacerte proseries and mint we have registered these and other trademarks and service marks in the united states and depending on the relevance of each brand to other markets in many foreign countries most registrations can be renewed perpetually at 10year intervals we also license intellectual property from third parties for use in our products 

although our portfolio of patents is growing the patents that have been issued to us could be determined to be invalid and may not be enforceable against competitive products in every jurisdiction in addition third parties have asserted and may in the future assert infringement claims against us and our customers these claims and any litigation may result in invalidation of our proprietary rights or a finding of infringement along with an assessment of damages litigation even if without merit could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention in addition thirdparty licenses may not continue to be available to us on commercially acceptable terms or at all 



as of july 31 2017  we had approximately 8200 fulltime employees in major offices in the united states canada india the united kingdom israel australia and other locations we also employ a significant number of seasonal and contract employees during the second and third quarters of our fiscal years to support our consumer tax customers for example at the peak of the 2016 tax season we employed approximately 1400 seasonal employees we believe our future success and growth will depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees in all areas of our business we do not currently have any collective bargaining agreements with our employees and we believe employee relations are generally good although we have employmentrelated agreements with a number of key employees these agreements do not guarantee continued service we believe we offer competitive compensation and a good working environment we were named one of fortune magazine’s “100 best companies to work for” in each of the last sixteen years however we face intense competition for qualified employees and we expect to face continuing challenges in recruiting and retention

 item 1a  risk factors 

tableend

our businesses routinely encounter and address risks many of which could cause our future results to be materially different than we presently anticipate below we describe certain important risks categorized solely for ease of reference as strategic operational legal and compliance and financial risks the manner in which we respond to future developments as well as our competitors’ reactions to those developments may affect our future operating results 

strategic risks 

strategic risks relate to our current and future operating model business plans and growth strategy including the risks associated with the following competitive pressures on our product offerings and business models our ability to adapt to technological changes and global trends our reliance on thirdparty intellectual property and our ability to protect our own intellectual property rights the value of our brand and mergers acquisitions and divestiture activity that may have unanticipated costs and expenses 

we face intense competitive pressures that may harm our operating results 

we face intense competition in all of our businesses and we expect competition to remain intense in the future our competitors and potential competitors range from large and established entities to emerging startups our competitors may introduce superior products and services reduce prices have greater technical marketing and other resources have greater name recognition have larger installed bases of customers have wellestablished relationships with our current and potential customers advertise aggressively or beat us to market with new products and services in addition we may face competition from existing companies with large established consumer userbases and broadbased platforms who may change or expand the focus of their business strategies and marketing to target our customers including small businesses and tax customers 

we also face competition from companies with a variety of business models and monetization strategies including increased competition from providers of free offerings particularly in our tax accounting and payments businesses in order to compete we have also introduced free offerings in several categories but we may not be able to attract customers as effectively as competitors with different business models in addition we may not be able to monetize our free offerings if other providers of free offerings provide features that we do not offer and customers who have formerly paid for intuit’s products and services may elect to use our competitors’ free offerings instead these competitive factors may diminish our revenue and profitability and harm our ability to acquire and retain customers 

our consumer tax business also faces significant competition from the public sector where we face the risk of federal and state taxing authorities proposing revenue strategies that involve developing and providing government tax software or other government return preparation systems at public expense these or similar programs may be introduced or expanded in the future which may change the voluntary compliance tax system in ways that could cause us to lose customers and revenue the irs free file program is currently the sole means by which the irs offers tax software to taxpayers and as part of the program the irs has agreed it will not offer a competing service under this program the irs has worked with private industry to provide more than 50 million free returns since 2003 utilizing donated private sector tax software and efiling services for low and middle income taxpayers at no cost to users or the government however its continuation depends on a number of factors including increasing public awareness of and access to the free program as well as continued government support the current agreement is scheduled to expire in october 2020 if the free file program were to be terminated and the irs were to enter the software development and return preparation space the federal government would become a direct competitor of the us tax services industry and of intuit which could potentially have material and adverse revenue implications 

future revenue growth depends upon our ability to adapt to technological change as well as global trends in the way customers access consumer software offerings and successfully introduce new and enhanced products services and business models 

online offerings desktop software and mobile technology industries are characterized by rapidly changing technology evolving industry standards and frequent new product introductions as we continue to grow our online mobile and other offerings we must continue to innovate and develop new products and features to meet changing customer needs and attract and retain talented software developers we need to continue to develop our skills tools and capabilities to capitalize on existing and emerging technologies which require us to devote significant resources 

our consumer and professional tax businesses depend significantly on revenue from customers who return each year to use our updated tax preparation and filing software and services as our existing products mature encouraging customers to purchase product upgrades becomes more challenging unless new product releases provide features and functionality that have meaningful incremental value we also provide additional customer benefits by utilizing customer data available to us through our existing offerings if we are not able to develop and clearly demonstrate the value of new or upgraded products or services to our customers or effectively utilize our customers’ data our revenues may be harmed in addition as we continue to introduce and expand our new business models including offerings that are free to end users we may be unsuccessful in monetizing or increasing customer adoption of these offerings or our risk profile may change resulting in loss of revenue 

tables of contents 

the number of people who access products and services through devices other than personal computers including mobile phones smartphones and handheld computers such as tablets continues to increase we have devoted significant resources to develop products and services for users of these alternative devices but the versions of our products and services developed for these devices may not be compelling to users even if we are able to attract new users through these mobile offerings the amount of revenue that we derive per user from mobile offerings may be less than the revenue that we have historically derived from users of personal computers as new devices and new platforms are continually being released it is difficult to predict the problems we may encounter in developing versions of our products and services for use on these alternative devices and we may need to devote significant resources to the creation support and maintenance of such offerings if we are slow to develop products and technologies that are compatible with these alternative devices or if our competitors are able to achieve those results more quickly than us we will fail to capture a significant share of an increasingly important portion of the market for online services which could adversely affect our business 

in some cases we may expend a significant amount of resources and management attention on offerings that do not ultimately succeed in their markets we have encountered difficulty in launching new products and services in the past if we misjudge customer needs in the future our new products and services may not succeed and our revenues and earnings may be harmed we have also invested and in the future expect to invest in new business models geographies strategies and initiatives such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties including distraction of management from current operations expenses associated with the initiatives and inadequate return on investments because these new initiatives are inherently risky they may not be successful and may harm our financial condition and operating results 

we rely on thirdparty intellectual property in our products and services 

many of our products and services include intellectual property of third parties which we license under agreements that may need to be renewed or renegotiated from time to time we may not be able to obtain licenses to these thirdparty technologies or content on reasonable terms or at all if we are unable to obtain the rights necessary to use this intellectual property in our products and services we may not be able to sell the affected offerings and customers who are currently using the affected product may be disrupted which may in turn harm our future financial results damage our brand and result in customer loss also we and our customers have been and may continue to be subject to infringement claims as a result of the thirdparty intellectual property incorporated in our offerings although we try to mitigate this risk and we may not be ultimately liable for any potential infringement pending claims require us to use significant resources require management attention and could result in loss of customers 

some of our offerings include thirdparty software that is licensed under socalled “open source” licenses some of which may include a requirement that under certain circumstances we make available or grant licenses to any modifications or derivative works we create based upon the open source software although we have established internal review and approval processes to mitigate these risks we may not be sure that all open source software is submitted for approval prior to use in our products many of the risks associated with usage of open source may not be eliminated and may if not properly addressed harm our business 

our intellectual property rights are valuable and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products services and brand 

our patents trademarks trade secrets copyrights and other intellectual property rights are important assets for us we aggressively protect our intellectual property rights by relying on federal state and common law rights in the us and internationally as well as a variety of administrative procedures we also rely on contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary rights in products and services the efforts that we take to protect our proprietary rights may not always be sufficient or effective protecting our intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming and may not be successful in every location any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business our brand and our ability to compete 

policing unauthorized use and copying of our products is difficult expensive and time consuming current us laws that prohibit copying give us only limited practical protection from software piracy and the laws of many other countries provide very little protection we frequently encounter unauthorized copies of our software being sold through online marketplaces although we continue to evaluate and put in place technology solutions to attempt to lessen the impact of piracy and engage in efforts to educate consumers and public policy leaders on these issues and cooperate with industry groups in their efforts to combat piracy we expect piracy to be a persistent problem that results in lost revenues and increased expenses 

our business depends on our strong reputation and the value of our brands 

developing and maintaining awareness of our brands is critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our existing and future products and services and is an important element in attracting new customers adverse publicity whether or not justified relating to events or activities attributed to us our employees or agents may tarnish our reputation and reduce the value of our brands damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity may reduce demand for our products and services and thus have an adverse effect on our future financial results as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of the brands 

tables of contents 

our acquisition and divestiture activities may disrupt our ongoing business may involve increased expenses and may present risks not contemplated at the time of the transactions 

we have acquired and may continue to acquire companies products and technologies that complement our strategic direction both in and outside the united states acquisitions involve significant risks and uncertainties including 

 we have divested and may in the future divest certain assets or businesses that no longer fit with our strategic direction or growth targets divestitures involve significant risks and uncertainties including 

 because acquisitions and divestitures are inherently risky our transactions may not be successful and may in some cases harm our operating results or financial condition although we typically fund our acquisitions through cash available from operations if we were to use debt to fund acquisitions or for other purposes our interest expense and leverage would increase significantly and if we were to issue equity securities as consideration in an acquisition current shareholders’ percentage ownership and earnings per share would be diluted 

operational risks 

operational risks arise from internal and external events relating to systems processes and people risks that affect the operation of our businesses include the following security breaches privacy and cybersecurity concerns relating to online offerings fraudulent activities by third parties relationships with third parties competition for and retention of key talent issues with our product launches problems with our information technology infrastructure and risks associated with operating internationally 

a security breach resulting in thirdparty access to our sensitive customer and employee information and data could materially disrupt our businesses result in the disclosure of confidential information significantly damage our reputation subject us to costly litigation and cause material losses 

we host collect use and retain large amounts of sensitive and personal customer and employee information and data including credit card information tax return information bank account numbers and passwords personal and business financial data and transactions social security numbers healthcare information and payroll information we and our vendors use commercially available security technologies to protect this information and data and we also use security and business 

tables of contents 

controls to limit access to and use of such sensitive and personal customer information and data although we expend significant resources to create security protections that shield our customer data against potential theft and security breaches such measures cannot provide absolute security we have experienced instances in the past where criminals using stolen identity information obtained outside of our systems have gained unauthorized and illegal access to our customers’ data as the accessibility of stolen identity information increases we may experience additional instances of unauthorized and illegal access to our systems using our customers’ stolen identity information in the future in addition third parties may fraudulently induce employees customers or users to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data or customers’ data the security measures that we implement may not be able to prevent access to our systems from unauthorized users who have fraudulently obtained our customers’ personal information in addition because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access change frequently becoming more sophisticated and are often not able to be detected until after a successful attack we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventive measures further as we move to an ecosystem where customers have one identity across multiple products a security breach may give access to increased amount of customer data a major breach of our security measures or those of third parties that provide hosting services or have access to our sensitive and personal customer information may have serious negative consequences for our businesses including possible litigation fines penalties and damages material harm to our reputation and brands further regulation and oversight by federal or state agencies and loss of our ability to provide financial transaction services or accept and process customer credit card orders or tax returns 

our technologies systems and networks and our customers’ devices have been subject to and are likely to continue to be the target of cyberattacks computer viruses worms phishing attacks malicious software programs and other information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release gathering monitoring misuse loss or destruction of our customers’ or employees’ sensitive and personal information and data or otherwise disrupt our or our customers’ or other third parties’ business operations these types of attacks can be made by individuals groups of hackers and sophisticated organizations including statesponsored organizations or nationstates themselves customers that fail to update their systems continue to run software that we no longer support or that fail to install security patches on a timely basis make it more difficult for us to detect and prevent these kinds of attacks although this is an industrywide problem that affects software across platforms it is increasingly affecting our offerings because cybercriminals tend to focus their efforts on wellknown offerings that are popular among customers and hold sensitive information and we expect them to continue to do so if these cybercriminals are able to circumvent our security measures exploit vulnerabilities in our customers’ devices or customers’ behavior or if we are unable to detect an intrusion into our systems and contain such intrusion in a reasonable amount of time our customers’ sensitive and personal information and data may be compromised which could lead to litigation with our customers fines penalties and other damages 

in addition our employees contractors temporary and seasonal employees may have access to sensitive and personal information of our customers and employees while we conduct background checks of our employees and these other individuals and limit access to systems and data it is possible that one or more of these individuals may circumvent these controls resulting in accidental or intentional disclosure or misuse of our customers’ or employees’ data in addition we rely on thirdparty vendors to host certain of our sensitive and personal information and data while we conduct due diligence on these thirdparty partners with respect to their security and business controls we may not have the ability to effectively monitor or oversee the implementation of these controls measures and in any event individuals or third parties may be able to circumvent these security and business controls andor exploit vulnerabilities that may exist in these controls resulting in the disclosure or misuse of sensitive and personal customer or employee information and data 

privacy and cybersecurity concerns relating to online offerings including our offerings specifically as well as the external environment generally could damage our reputation and deter current and potential customers from adopting our products and services 

from time to time we detect or receive notices from customers or public or private agencies that they have detected actual or perceived vulnerabilities in our servers our software or thirdparty software components that are distributed with our products or fraudulent activity by unauthorized persons utilizing our products with stolen customer identity information the existence of such vulnerabilities or fraudulent activity even if they do not result in a security breach may undermine customer confidence as well as the confidence of government agencies that regulate our offerings as we further transition our businesses to online and connected services continue to collect more personal and sensitive information and operate in more countries the risk that perceived vulnerabilities of our systems could seriously harm our business by tarnishing our reputation and brand andor limiting the adoption of our products and services is likely to increase 

in addition the continued occurrence of cyberattacks and data breaches on governments businesses and consumers in general indicates that we operate in an external environment where cyberattacks and data breaches are becoming increasingly common if the global cybersecurity environment worsens and there are increased instances of security breaches of thirdparty offerings where consumers’ data and sensitive information is compromised consumers may be less willing to use online offerings particularly offerings like ours where customers often share sensitive financial data this could damage our reputation and deter current and potential customers from adopting our products and services or lead customers to cease using online and connected software products to transact financial business altogether

if we are unable to effectively combat the increasing amount and sophistication of fraudulent activities by third parties using our offerings we may suffer losses which may be substantial and lose the confidence of our customers and government agencies and our revenues and earnings may be harmed 

the online tax preparation payroll administration and online payments industries have been experiencing an increasing amount of fraudulent activities by third parties and those fraudulent activities are becoming increasingly sophisticated although we do not believe that any of this activity is uniquely targeted at our products or business this type of fraudulent activity may adversely impact our tax payroll and payments businesses in addition to any losses that may result from such fraud which may be substantial a loss of confidence by our customers or by governmental agencies in our ability to prevent fraudulent activity that is perpetrated through our offerings may seriously harm our business and damage our brand if we cannot adequately combat such fraudulent activity that is perpetrated through our tax offerings governmental authorities may refuse to allow us to continue to offer such services which could include federal or state tax authorities refusing to allow us to process our customers’ tax returns electronically resulting in a significant adverse impact on our earnings and revenue as fraudulent activities become more pervasive and increasingly sophisticated and fraud detection and prevention measures must become correspondingly more complex to combat them across the various industries in which we operate we may implement risk control mechanisms that could make it more difficult for legitimate customers to obtain and use our products which could result in lost revenue and negatively impact our earnings 

if we fail to process transactions effectively or fail to adequately protect against disputed or potential fraudulent activities our business may be harmed 

our operations process a significant volume and dollar value of transactions on a daily basis especially in our payroll and payments businesses despite our efforts to ensure that effective processing systems and controls are in place to handle transactions appropriately it is possible that we may make errors or that funds may be misappropriated due to fraud the systems supporting our business are comprised of multiple technology platforms that are difficult to scale if we are unable to effectively manage our systems and processes or if there is an error in our products we may be unable to process customer data in an accurate reliable and timely manner which may harm our reputation the willingness of customers to use our products and our financial results in our payments processing service business if merchants for whom we process payment transactions are unable to pay refunds due to their customers in connection with disputed or fraudulent merchant transactions we may be required to pay those amounts and our payments may exceed the amount of the customer reserves we have established to make such payments 

business interruption or failure of our information technology and communication systems may impair the availability of our products and services which may damage our reputation and harm our future financial results 

our reputation and ability to attract retain and serve our customers is dependent upon the reliable performance of our products and our underlying technical infrastructure as we continue to transition our business to more connected services we become more dependent on the continuing operation and availability of our information technology and communication systems and those of our external service providers including for example thirdparty internetbased or “cloud” computing services we do not have redundancy for all of our systems many of our critical applications reside in only one of our data centers and our disaster recovery planning may not account for all eventualities in the event of significant system disruption we may experience loss of data or processing capabilities which may cause us to lose customers and may materially harm our reputation and our operating results in addition we are in the process of updating our customer facing applications and the supporting information technology infrastructure to meet our customers’ expectations for continuous service availability any difficulties in upgrading these applications or infrastructure or failure of our systems or those of our thirdparty service providers may result in interruptions in our service which may reduce our revenues and profits cause us to lose customers and damage our reputation any prolonged interruptions at any time may result in lost customers additional refunds of customer charges negative publicity and increased operating costs any of which may significantly harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

our tax businesses must effectively handle extremely heavy customer demand during critical peak periods from january until april of each year we face significant risks in maintaining adequate service levels during these peak periods where we derive a substantial portion of our overall revenue from the tax businesses any interruptions in our online tax preparation or electronic filing service at any time during the tax season particularly during a peak period could result in significantly decreased revenue lost customers additional refunds of customer charges negative publicity and increased operating costs any of which could significantly harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are in the process of migrating our applications and infrastructure to new data centers and to thirdparty hosted environments if we do not execute the transition to these new environments in an effective manner we may experience unplanned service disruptions or unforeseen increases in costs which may harm our operating results and our business 

tables of contents 

we rely on internal systems and external systems maintained by manufacturers distributors and other service providers to take and fulfill customer orders handle customer service requests and host certain online activities any interruption or failure of our internal or external systems may prevent us or our service providers from accepting and fulfilling customer orders or cause company and customer data to be unintentionally disclosed our continuing efforts to upgrade and expand our network security and other information systems as well as our highavailability capabilities may be costly and problems with the design or implementation of system enhancements may harm our business and our results of operations 

our business operations data centers information technology and communications systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters human error malicious attacks fire power loss telecommunications failures computer viruses computer denial of service attacks terrorist attacks and other events beyond our control in addition our corporate headquarters and other critical business operations are located near major seismic faults in the event of a major natural or manmade disaster our insurance coverage may not completely compensate us for our losses and our future financial results may be materially harmed 

if we are unable to develop manage and maintain critical thirdparty business relationships our business may be adversely affected 

our growth is increasingly dependent on the strength of our business relationships and our ability to continue to develop manage and maintain new and existing relationships we rely on various thirdparty partners including software and service providers suppliers vendors manufacturers distributors accountants contractors financial institutions core processors licensing partners and development partners among others in many areas of our business in order to deliver our offerings and operate our business we also rely on third parties to support the operation of our business by maintaining our physical facilities equipment power systems and infrastructure in certain instances these thirdparty relationships are sole source or limited source relationships and can be difficult to replace or substitute depending on the level of integration of the third party’s products or services into or with our offerings andor the general availability of such third party’s products and services in addition there may be few or no alternative thirdparty providers or vendors in the market further there can be no assurance that we will be able to adequately retain thirdparty contractors engaged to help us operate our business the failure of third parties to provide acceptable and high quality products services and technologies or to update their products services and technologies may result in a disruption to our business operations and our customers which may reduce our revenues and profits cause us to lose customers and damage our reputation alternative arrangements and services may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or we may experience business interruptions upon a transition to an alternative partner 

although we have strict standards for our suppliers and business partners to comply with the law and company policies regarding workplace and employment practices data use and security environmental compliance intellectual property licensing and other applicable regulatory and compliance requirements we cannot control their daytoday practices if any of them violate laws or implements practices regarded as unethical we could experience supply chain disruptions canceled orders terminations of or damage to key relationships and damage to our reputation 

in particular we have relationships with banks credit unions and other financial institutions that support certain critical services we offer to our customers if macroeconomic conditions or other factors cause any of these institutions to fail consolidate stop providing certain services or institute costcutting efforts our business and financial results may suffer and we may be unable to offer those services to our customers 

we have also started to increasingly utilize the distribution platforms of third parties like apple’s app store and google’s play store for the distribution of certain of our product offerings although we benefit from the strong brand recognition and large user base of these distribution platforms to attract new customers the platform owners have wide discretion to change the pricing structure terms of service and other policies with respect to us and other developers any adverse changes by these third parties could adversely affect our financial results 

because competition for our key employees is intense we may not be able to attract retain and develop the highly skilled employees we need to support our planned growth 

much of our future success depends on the continued service and availability of skilled personnel including members of our executive team and those in technical marketing and staff positions experienced personnel in the software mobile technologies data science data security and software as a service industries are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense especially in california and india where the majority of our employees are located also as we strive to continue to adapt to technological change and introduce new and enhanced products and business models we must be able to secure maintain and develop the right quality and quantity of engaged and committed talent the incentives we have available to attract retain and motivate employees provided by our equity awards may become less effective and if we were to issue significant equity to attract additional employees the ownership of our existing stockholders would be diluted although we strive to be an employer of choice we may not be able to continue to successfully attract retain and develop key personnel which may cause our business to suffer 

tables of contents 

the nature of our products and services necessitates timely product launches and if we experience significant product accuracy or quality problems or delays it may harm our revenue earnings and reputation 

all of our tax products and many of our nontax products have rigid development timetables that increase the risk of errors in our products and the risk of launch delays our tax preparation software product development cycle is particularly challenging due to the need to incorporate unpredictable and potentially late tax law and tax form changes each year and because our customers expect high levels of accuracy and a timely launch of these products to prepare and file their taxes by the tax filing deadline due to the complexity of our products and the condensed development cycles under which we operate our products may contain errors that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the software or result in incorrect calculations the complexity of the tax laws on which our products are based may also make it difficult for us to consistently deliver offerings that contain the features functionality and level of accuracy that our customers expect when we encounter problems we may be required to modify our code work with state tax administrators to communicate with affected customers assist customers with amendments distribute patches to customers who have already purchased the product and recall or repackage existing product inventory in our distribution channels if we encounter development challenges or discover errors in our products either late in our development cycle or after release it may cause us to delay our product launch date or suspend product availability until such issues can be fixed any major defects launch delays or product suspensions may lead to loss of customers and revenue negative publicity customer and employee dissatisfaction reduced retailer shelf space and promotions and increased operating expenses such as inventory replacement costs legal fees or other payments including those resulting from our accuracy guarantee in our tax preparation products for example an error in our tax products could cause a compliance error for taxpayers including the over or underpayment of their federal or state tax liability while our accuracy guarantee commits us to reimburse penalties and interest paid by customers due solely to calculation errors in our tax preparation products such errors may result in additional burdens on third parties that we may need to address or that may cause us to suspend the availability of our products until such errors are addressed this could also affect our reputation the willingness of customers to use our products and our financial results 

we regularly invest resources to update and improve our internal information technology systems and software platforms should our investments not succeed or if delays or other issues with new or existing internal technology systems and software platforms disrupt our operations our business could be harmed 

we rely on our network and data center infrastructure and internal technology systems for many of our development marketing operational support sales accounting and financial reporting activities we are continually investing resources to update and improve these systems and environments in order to meet existing as well as the growing and changing requirements of our business and customers if we experience prolonged delays or unforeseen difficulties in updating and upgrading our systems and architecture we may experience outages and may not be able to deliver certain offerings and develop new offerings and enhancements that we need to remain competitive such improvements and upgrades are often complex costly and time consuming in addition such improvements can be challenging to integrate with our existing technology systems or may uncover problems with our existing technology systems unsuccessful implementation of hardware or software updates and improvements could result in outages disruption in our business operations loss of revenue or damage to our reputation 

our international operations are subject to increased risks which may harm our business operating results and financial condition 

in addition to uncertainty about our ability to generate revenues from our foreign operations and expand into international markets there are risks inherent in doing business internationally including 



tables of contents 

 violations of the rapidly evolving and complex foreign and us laws and regulations that apply to our international operations may result in fines criminal actions or sanctions against us our officers or our employees prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with these laws there can be no assurance that our employees contractors or agents will not violate our policies these risks inherent in our international operations and expansion increase our costs of doing business internationally and may result in harm to our business operating results and financial condition 

legal and compliance risks 

legal and compliance risks arise from change in the government and regulatory environment potential litigation regulatory inquiries and intellectual property infringement claims government and regulatory risk include the following increased government regulations ongoing litigation and regulatory inquiries and intellectual property infringement 

increased government regulation of our businesses or changes to existing regulations may harm our operating results 

the company is subject to federal state and local laws and regulations that affect the company’s activities including without limitation areas of labor advertising tax financial services data privacy and security requirements digital content consumer protection real estate billing ecommerce promotions quality of services intellectual property ownership and infringement import and export requirements anticorruption foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions anticompetition environmental health and safety there have been significant new regulations and heightened focus by the government on many of these areas as well as in areas such as insurance and healthcare including for example the affordable care act a s we expand our products and services and revise our business models both domestically and internationally we may become subject to additional government regulation or increased regulatory scrutiny further regulators both in the us and in other jurisdictions in which we operate may adopt new laws or regulations change existing regulations or their interpretation of existing laws or regulations may differ from ours  

as our business continues to expand to countries outside the united states that have more strict data protection laws our compliance requirements and costs may increase recent legal developments in the european union have created compliance uncertainty and increased complexity regarding certain transfers of information from europe to the us the european commission has approved a data protection regulation known as the gdpr which has been finalized and is due to come into force in may 2018 the gdpr will require certain operational changes to be made by companies that receive or process personal data of residents of the eu and will include significant penalties for noncompliance in addition other governmental authorities around the world are considering similar types of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection due to the uncertain international environment we could face additional compliance obligations that could cause us to incur costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business further these regulatory requirements could also impose significant limitations require changes to our business require notification to customers or employees of a security breach restrict our use or storage of personal information or cause changes in customer purchasing behavior which may make our business more costly less efficient or impossible to conduct and may require us to modify our current or future products or services which may make customers less likely to purchase our products or harm our future financial results we have incurred – and may continue to incur – significant expenses to comply with mandatory privacy and security standards and protocols imposed by law regulation industry standards or contractual obligations 

the tax preparation industry continues to receive heightened attention from federal and state governments new legislation regulation public policy considerations changes in the cybersecurity environment litigation by the government or private entities changes to or new interpretations of existing laws may result in greater oversight of the tax preparation industry restrict the types of products and services that we can offer or the prices we can charge or otherwise cause us to change the way we operate our tax businesses or offer our tax products and services we may not be able to respond quickly to such regulatory legislative and other developments and these changes may in turn increase our cost of doing business and limit our revenue opportunities in addition if our practices are not consistent with new interpretations of existing laws we may become subject to lawsuits penalties and other liabilities that did not previously apply we are also required to comply with a variety of state revenue agency standards in order to successfully operate our tax preparation and electronic filing services changes in stateimposed requirements by one or more of the states including the required use of specific technologies or technology standards may significantly increase the costs of providing those services to our customers and may prevent us from delivering a quality product to our customers in a timely manner 

we are also subject to certain laws and regulations in the us and other jurisdictions relating to electronic funds transfer money transmission and other regulated activities in the event laws governing regulated activities change or expand we may be subject to additional compliance costs as we increase our business activities into regulated areas such as lending we may be subject to increased regulations and compliance requirements 

tables of contents 

we are frequently a party to litigation and regulatory inquiries which could result in an unfavorable outcome and have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operation and cash flows 

we are subject to various legal proceedings including class action lawsuits claims and regulatory inquiries that have arisen out of the ordinary conduct of our business and are not yet resolved and additional claims and inquiries may arise in the future the number and significance of these claims and inquiries have increased as our businesses have evolved any proceedings claims or inquiries initiated by or against us whether successful or not may be time consuming result in costly litigation damage awards consent decrees injunctive relief or increased costs of business require us to change our business practices or products require significant amounts of management time result in diversion of significant operations resources or otherwise harm our business and future financial results for further information about specific litigation see item 3 “legal proceedings” 

third parties claiming that we infringe their proprietary rights may cause us to incur significant legal expenses and prevent us from selling our products 

we may become increasingly subject to infringement claims including patent copyright trade secret and trademark infringement claims litigation may be necessary to determine the validity and scope of the intellectual property rights of others we have received a number of allegations of intellectual property infringement claims in the past and expect to receive more claims in the future based on allegations that our offerings infringe upon the intellectual property held by third parties some of these claims are the subject of pending litigation against us and against some of our customers these claims may involve patent holding companies or other adverse intellectual property owners who have no relevant product revenues of their own and against whom our own intellectual property may provide little or no deterrence the ultimate outcome of any allegation is uncertain and regardless of outcome any such claim with or without merit may be time consuming to defend result in costly litigation divert management’s time and attention from our business require us to stop selling delay shipping or redesign our products or require us to pay monetary damages for royalty or licensing fees or to satisfy indemnification obligations that we have with some of our customers our failure to obtain necessary license or other rights or litigation arising out of intellectual property claims may harm our business 

we are subject to risks associated with information disseminated through our services 

the laws relating to the liability of online services companies for information such as online content disseminated through their services are subject to frequent challenges in spite of settled law in the us claims are made against online services companies by parties who disagree with the content where our online content is accessed on the internet outside of the us challenges may be brought under foreign laws which do not provide the same protections for online services companies as in the us these challenges in either us or foreign jurisdictions may rise to legal claims alleging defamation libel invasion of privacy negligence copyright or trademark infringement or other theories based on the nature and content of the materials disseminated through the services certain of our services include content generated by users of our online services although this content is not generated by us claims of defamation or other injury may be made against us for that content any costs incurred as a result of this potential liability may harm our business 

financial risks 

financial risks relate to our ability to meet financial obligations and mitigate exposure to financial impacts to our businesses or our offerings financial risks arise from the following seasonality excessive product returns unanticipated changes in income tax rates adverse global macroeconomic conditions fluctuations in our net income indebtedness and the fluctuation of our stock price 

our tax business is highly seasonal and our quarterly results could fluctuate significantly 

our tax offerings have significant seasonal patterns revenue from income tax preparation products and services is heavily concentrated during november through april this seasonality has caused significant fluctuations in our quarterly financial results our financial results may also fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year due to a variety of factors including factors that may affect the timing of revenue recognition these include changes to our offerings that result in the inclusion or exclusion of ongoing services changes in product pricing strategies or product sales mix the timing of the availability of federal and state tax forms from taxing agencies and the ability of those agencies to receive electronic tax return submissions changes in customer behavior and the timing of our discontinuation of support for older product offerings other factors that may affect our quarterly or annual financial results include the timing of acquisitions divestitures and goodwill and acquired intangible asset impairment charges any fluctuations in our operating results may adversely affect our stock price 

if actual product returns exceed returns reserves our future financial results may be harmed 

we ship more desktop software products to our distributors and retailers than we expect them to sell in order to reduce the risk that distributors or retailers may run out of products this is particularly true for our tax products which have a short selling season and for which returns occur primarily in our fiscal third and fourth quarters like many software companies that sell their products through distributors and retailers we have historically accepted significant product returns we establish reserves against revenue for product returns in our financial statements based on estimated returns and we closely monitor 

tables of contents 

product sales and inventory in the retail channel in an effort to maintain adequate reserves in the past returns have not differed significantly from these reserves however if we experience actual returns that significantly exceed reserves it may result in lower net revenue 

unanticipated changes in our income tax rates may affect our future financial results 

our future effective income tax rates may be favorably or unfavorably affected by unanticipated changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities by changes in our stock price or by changes in tax laws or their interpretation in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes these continuous examinations may result in unforeseen taxrelated liabilities which may harm our future financial results 

adverse global economic conditions could harm our business and financial condition 

adverse macroeconomic developments could negatively affect our business and financial condition adverse global economic events have caused and could in the future cause disruptions and volatility in global financial markets and increased rates of default and bankruptcy and could impact consumer and small business spending while we have historically performed well in economic downturns there is no guarantee that we would continue to perform well in future adverse macroeconomic conditions in particular because the majority of our revenue is derived from sales within the us economic conditions in the us have an even greater impact on us than companies with a more diverse international presence challenging economic times could cause potential new customers not to purchase or to delay purchasing of our products and services and could cause our existing customers to discontinue purchasing or delay upgrades of our existing products and services thereby negatively impacting our revenues and future financial results decreased consumer spending levels could also reduce credit and debit card transaction processing volumes causing reductions in our payments revenue poor economic conditions and high unemployment have caused and could in the future cause a significant decrease in the number of tax returns filed which may have a significant effect on the number of tax returns we prepare and file in addition weakness in the enduser consumer and small business markets could negatively affect the cash flow of our distributors and resellers who could in turn delay paying their obligations to us which could increase our credit risk exposure and cause delays in our recognition of revenue or future sales to these customers any of these events could harm our business and our future financial results 

amortization of acquired intangible assets and impairment charges may cause significant fluctuation in our net income 

our acquisitions have resulted in significant expenses including amortization and impairment of acquired technology and other acquired intangible assets and impairment of goodwill total costs and expenses in these categories were 14 million in fiscal 2017  34 million in fiscal 2016  and 339 million in fiscal 2015  of which 149 million was classified as discontinued operations although under current accounting rules goodwill is not amortized we may incur impairment charges related to the goodwill already recorded and to goodwill arising out of future acquisitions we test the impairment of goodwill annually in our fourth fiscal quarter or more frequently if indicators of impairment arise the timing of the formal annual test may result in charges to our statement of operations in our fourth fiscal quarter that may not have been reasonably foreseen in prior periods the total costs and expenses for fiscal 2015 included goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges of 297 million of which 149 million was classified as discontinued operations at july 31 2017  we had 13 billion in goodwill and 22 million in net acquired intangible assets on our balance sheet both of which may be subject to impairment charges in the future new acquisitions and any impairment of the value of acquired intangible assets may have a significant negative impact on our future financial results 

we have 488 million in debt outstanding and may incur other debt in the future which may adversely affect our financial condition and future financial results 

on february 1 2016 we entered into a master credit agreement with certain institutional lenders for a new fiveyear credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of 15 billion the master credit agreement includes a 500 million unsecured term loan and a 1 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that will expire on february 1 2021 as of july 31 2017  we had no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility and had an outstanding debt of 488 million on the term loan we may use the proceeds of any advances against the credit facility for general corporate purposes including future acquisitions and share repurchases 

this debt may adversely affect our financial condition and future financial results by among other things 



tables of contents 

our current unsecured revolving credit facility imposes restrictions on us including restrictions on our ability to create liens on our assets and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur indebtedness and require us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios our ability to comply with these ratios may be affected by events beyond our control in addition our short and longterm debt includes covenants that may adversely affect our ability to incur certain liens or engage in certain types of sale and leaseback transactions if we breach any of the covenants under our short and longterm debt or our unsecured revolving credit facility and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders then subject to applicable cure periods any outstanding indebtedness may be declared immediately due and payable

in fiscal 2015 intuit was contacted by regulatory authorities including congress the federal trade commission the sec the department of justice and certain state attorneys general which are conducting inquiries in connection with the increase during the 2015 tax season in attempts by criminals using stolen identity information to file fraudulent tax returns and claim refunds at the state and federal levels intuit is cooperating with all such government inquiries including formal requests for information in addition we are the subject of certain actions including a consolidated putative class action lawsuit by individuals who claim to have suffered damages in connection with the foregoing events we believe that the allegations contained within these lawsuits are without merit and we intend to vigorously defend against them 

intuit is subject to certain routine legal proceedings including class action lawsuits like those described above as well as demands claims government inquiries and threatened litigation that arise in the normal course of our business including assertions that we may be infringing patents or other intellectual property rights of others we currently believe that in addition to any amounts accrued the amount of potential losses if any for any pending claims of any type either alone or combined will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements the ultimate outcome of any litigation is uncertain and regardless of outcome litigation can have an adverse impact on intuit because of defense costs negative publicity diversion of management resources and other factors our failure to obtain necessary license or other rights or litigation arising out of intellectual property claims could adversely affect our business

 item 7  management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda is intended to provide readers of our consolidated financial statements with the perspectives of management this should allow the readers of this report to obtain a comprehensive understanding of our businesses strategies current trends and future prospects our mda includes the following sections 

you should note that this mda discussion contains forwardlooking statements that involve risks and uncertainties please see the section entitled “forwardlooking statements” immediately preceding part 1 for important information to consider when evaluating such statements 

you should read this mda in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes in item 8 of this annual report in fiscal 2016 we completed the sales of our demandforce quickbase and quicken businesses we accounted for all of these businesses as discontinued operations and have therefore reclassified our statements of operations for all periods presented to reflect them as such because the cash flows of these discontinued operations were not material for any period presented we have not segregated them on our statements of cash flows see “results of operations – nonoperating income and expense – discontinued operations” later in this item 7 for more information unless otherwise noted the following discussion pertains to our continuing operations 



this overview provides a high level discussion of our operating results and some of the trends that affect our business we believe that an understanding of these trends is important in order to understand our financial results for fiscal 2017 as well as our future prospects this summary is not intended to be exhaustive nor is it a substitute for the detailed discussion and analysis provided elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 



industry trends 

the industry in which we operate is dynamic and highly competitive and we expect it to remain so in the future the markets for software and related services especially highlyavailable connected services are characterized by rapid technological change shifting customer needs and frequent new product introductions and enhancements competitive interest and expertise in many of the markets we serve have grown markedly over the past few years and we expect this trend to continue there are also large cloudbased service companies who innovate quickly and serve small businesses and consumers while today our competition with such companies may be limited as we and those companies grow our competition with them may increase in recent years the widespread availability of the internet the emergence of mobile devices and the explosion of social media have accelerated the pace of change and revolutionized the way that people throughout the world manage important financial tasks the result is a global market that is shifting from traditional services that are paperbased humanproduced and brickandmortar bound to one where people understand demand and embrace the benefits of connected services this trend toward connected services is the primary driver of the strategies in all of our businesses 

seasonality 

our consumer tax offerings have significant seasonal patterns as a result during each of the last three fiscal years the total revenue for our third quarter ended april 30 has represented nearly half of our total revenue for those years we expect the seasonality of our consumer tax business to continue to have a significant impact on our quarterly financial results in the future 

tables of contents 



our growth strategy depends upon our ability to initiate and embrace disruptive technology trends to enter new markets and to drive broad adoption of the products and services we develop and market our future growth also increasingly depends on the strength of our thirdparty business relationships and our ability to continue to develop maintain and strengthen new and existing relationships to remain competitive and continue to grow we are investing significant resources in our product development marketing and sales capabilities and we expect to continue to do so in the future 

as we continue transitioning to offer more connected services the ongoing operation and availability of our information technology and communication systems and those of our external service providers is becoming increasingly important because we help customers manage their financial lives we face risks associated with the hosting collection use and retention of personal customer information and data we are investing significant management attention and resources in our information technology infrastructure and in our privacy and security capabilities and we expect to continue to do so in the future 

beginning in early calendar year 2015 state taxing authorities the irs and the tax preparation industry experienced an increase in attempts by criminals using stolen identity information to file fraudulent tax returns and claim refunds at the federal level and expanding into the state level we implemented additional security measures in our products and began working with state governments to share information regarding suspicious filings while continuing to share such information with the federal government we continue to invest in security and to work with the broader industry and government to protect our customers against this type of fraud 

for a complete discussion of the most significant risks and uncertainties affecting our business please see “forwardlooking statements” immediately preceding part 1 and “risk factors” in item 1a of part i of this report 



the most important financial indicators that we use to assess our business are revenue growth for the company as a whole for each reportable segment and for product lines within each reportable segment operating income growth and operating income margins for the company as a whole and for each reportable segment earnings per share and cash flow from operations we also track certain nonfinancial drivers of revenue growth and when material identify them in the applicable discussions of segment results below these nonfinancial drivers include for example customer growth and retention for all of our businesses and transaction volume for our payment processing business total credit and debit card transaction volume correlates strongly with the macroeconomic environment and is one of the key drivers of revenue growth in our payment processing business customers for our connected services offerings have generally grown faster than those for our traditional desktop software offerings reflecting our strategic focus on connected services over the past few years connected services total service and other revenue generated 38 billion or 73 of our total revenue in fiscal 2017  we expect connected services revenue as a percentage of our total revenue to continue to grow in the future 



tables of contents 



in preparing our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap we are required to make estimates assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on our net revenue operating income or loss and net income or loss as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our balance sheet we believe that the estimates assumptions and judgments involved in the following accounting policies have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies 

 our senior management has reviewed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and their disclosure in this annual report on form 10k with the audit and risk committee of our board of directors 

revenue recognition 

we derive revenue from the sale of software subscriptions hosted services packaged software products financial supplies technical support plans transaction fees merchant services hardware and multiple element arrangements that may include a combination of these items we follow the appropriate revenue recognition rules for each type of revenue for additional information see “revenue recognition” in note 1 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report we generally recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists we have delivered the product or performed the service the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable however determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves exercising judgment and using estimates that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report for example for multiple element arrangements containing only software and softwarerelated elements we must exercise judgment and use estimates in order to 1 allocate the total price among the various elements we must deliver 2 determine whether undelivered services are essential to the functionality of the delivered products and services 3 determine whether vendorspecific evidence of fair value exists for each undelivered element and 4 determine whether and when each element has been delivered for multiple element arrangements containing nonsoftware elements we must exercise judgment and use estimates in order to 1 determine whether and when each element has been delivered 2 determine the fair value of each element using the selling price hierarchy of vendorspecific evidence of fair value vsoe if available thirdparty evidence tpe if vsoe is not available and estimated selling price esp if neither vsoe nor tpe is available and 3 allocate the total price among the various elements based on the relative selling price method if we were to change any of these judgments or estimates it could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period amounts for fees collected or invoiced and due relating to arrangements where revenue cannot be recognized are reflected on our balance sheet as deferred revenue and recognized when the applicable revenue recognition criteria are satisfied 

business combinations 

as described in “description of business and summary of significant accounting policies – business combinations” in note 1 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report under the acquisition method of accounting we generally recognize the identifiable assets acquired the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interests in an acquiree at their fair values as of the date of acquisition we measure goodwill as the excess of consideration transferred which we also measure at fair value over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed the acquisition method of accounting requires us to exercise judgment and make significant estimates and assumptions regarding the fair values of the elements of a business combination as of the date of acquisition including the fair values of identifiable intangible assets deferred tax asset valuation allowances liabilities related to uncertain tax positions and contingencies this method also requires us to refine these estimates over a oneyear measurement period to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that if known would have affected the measurement of the amounts recognized as of that date if we are required to retroactively adjust provisional amounts that we have recorded for the fair values of assets and liabilities in connection with acquisitions these adjustments could materially decrease our operating income and net income and result in lower asset values on our balance sheet 

significant estimates and assumptions that we must make in estimating the fair value of acquired technology customer lists and other identifiable intangible assets include future cash flows that we expect to generate from the acquired assets if the subsequent actual results and updated projections of the underlying business activity change compared with the assumptions and projections used to develop these values we could record impairment charges in addition we have estimated the economic lives of certain acquired assets and these lives are used to calculate depreciation and amortization expense if our estimates of the economic lives change depreciation or amortization expenses could be accelerated or slowed

goodwill acquired intangible assets and other longlived assets – impairment assessments 

we estimate the fair value of acquired intangible assets and other longlived assets that have finite useful lives whenever an event or change in circumstances indicates that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable we test for potential impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives annually in our fourth fiscal quarter or whenever indicators of impairment arise the timing of the annual test may result in charges to our statement of operations in our fourth fiscal quarter that could not have been reasonably foreseen in prior periods 

as described in “description of business and summary of significant accounting policies – goodwill acquired intangible assets and other longlived assets” in note 1 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report in order to estimate the fair value of goodwill we use a weighted combination of a discounted cash flow model known as the income approach and comparisons to publicly traded companies engaged in similar businesses known as the market approach the income approach requires us to use a number of assumptions including market factors specific to the business the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows to be generated by the business over an extended period of time longterm growth rates for the business and a rate of return that considers the relative risk of achieving the cash flows and the time value of money we evaluate cash flows at the reporting unit level although the assumptions we use in our discounted cash flow model are consistent with the assumptions we use to generate our internal strategic plans and forecasts significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of future cash flows from each reporting unit and the relative risk of achieving those cash flows when using the market approach we make judgments about the comparability of publicly traded companies engaged in similar businesses we base our judgments on factors such as size growth rates profitability risk and return on investment we also make judgments when adjusting market multiples of revenue operating income and earnings for these companies to reflect their relative similarity to our own businesses we had a total of 13 billion in goodwill on our balance sheet at july 31 2017  see note 5 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report for a summary of goodwill by reportable segment 

we estimate the recoverability of acquired intangible assets and other longlived assets that have finite useful lives by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows that we expect the asset to generate in order to estimate the fair value of those assets we estimate the present value of future cash flows from those assets the key assumptions that we use in our discounted cash flow model are the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows to be generated by the asset over an extended period of time and a rate of return that considers the relative risk of achieving the cash flows and the time value of money significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of future cash flows and the relative risk of achieving those cash flows we also make judgments about the remaining useful lives of acquired intangible assets and other longlived assets that have finite lives we had a total of 22 million in net acquired intangible assets on our balance sheet at july 31 2017  

assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives are complex and often subjective they can be affected by a variety of factors including external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts for example if our future operating results do not meet current forecasts or if we experience a sustained decline in our market capitalization that is determined to be indicative of a reduction in fair value of one or more of our reporting units we may be required to record future impairment charges for goodwill and acquired intangible assets impairment charges could materially decrease our future net income and result in lower asset values on our balance sheet 

during the fourth quarters of fiscal 2017  fiscal 2016  and fiscal 2015 we performed our annual goodwill impairment tests using the methodology described in “description of business and summary of significant accounting policies – goodwill acquired intangible assets and other longlived assets” in note 1 to the financial statements in part 8 of this annual report we determined that the estimated fair values of all of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values and that they were not impaired in addition during this analysis we concluded that the estimated fair values of all of our reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying values 

during the third quarter of fiscal 2015 there was a significant decline in the revenue and operating income forecast for our consumer ecosystem reporting unit as a result of this development we performed an interim impairment test of goodwill and acquired intangible assets for that reporting unit we concluded that the carrying value of goodwill associated with our consumer ecosystem reporting unit was impaired and we recorded an impairment charge of 263 million that reduced the carrying value of goodwill to 211 million as of april 30 2015 see “ fair value measurements – assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis” in note 2 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report for more information 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 management approved a plan to sell our quicken business which was part of our consumer ecosystem reporting unit and we accounted for it as discontinued operations as a result we reclassified a portion of the goodwill impairment charge that we recorded in the third quarter of fiscal 2015 to discontinued operations based on the relative fair values of quicken and the remaining components of our consumer ecosystem reporting unit in the third quarter of fiscal 2016 we completed the sale of our quicken business for cash consideration that was not significant

accounting for sharebased compensation plans 

at july 31 2017  there was 802 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested sharebased compensation arrangements granted under all equity compensation plans which we will amortize to expense in the future we expect to recognize that cost over a weighted average vesting period of 24 years 

in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 we elected to early adopt asu 201609 “compensation — stock compensation topic 718 improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting” as part of this new standard we have elected to account for forfeitures as they occur rather than estimate expected forfeitures over the course of a vesting period see note 1 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report for more information 

we use a lattice binomial model and the assumptions described in note 10 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report to estimate the fair value of stock options granted we estimate the expected term of options granted based on implied exercise patterns using a binomial model we estimate the volatility of our common stock at the date of grant based on the implied volatility of publicly traded oneyear and twoyear options on our common stock our decision to use implied volatility is based upon the availability of actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility we base the riskfree interest rate that we use in our option valuation model on the implied yield in effect at the time of option grant on constant maturity us treasury issues with equivalent remaining terms we use an annualized expected dividend yield in our option valuation model we adjust sharebased compensation expense for actual forfeitures as they occur prior to our adoption of asu 201609 in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 we estimated forfeitures at the time of grant and revised those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differed from those estimates we amortize the fair value of options on a straightline basis over the requisite service periods of the awards which are generally the vesting periods we may elect to use different assumptions under our option valuation model in the future which could materially affect our net income or loss and net income or loss per share 

restricted stock units rsus granted typically vest based on continued service we value these timebased rsus at the date of grant using the intrinsic value method we amortize the fair value of timebased rsus on a straightline basis over the service period certain rsus granted to senior management vest based on the achievement of preestablished performance or market goals we estimate the fair value of performancebased rsus at the date of grant using the intrinsic value method and the probability that the specified performance criteria will be met each quarter we update our assessment of the probability that the specified performance criteria will be achieved and adjust our estimate of the fair value of the performancebased rsus if necessary we amortize the fair values of performancebased rsus over the requisite service period for each separately vesting tranche of the award we estimate the fair value of marketbased rsus at the date of grant using a monte carlo valuation methodology and amortize those fair values over the requisite service period for each separately vesting tranche of the award the monte carlo methodology that we use to estimate the fair value of marketbased rsus at the date of grant incorporates into the valuation the possibility that the market condition may not be satisfied provided that the requisite service is rendered the total fair value of the marketbased rsus at the date of grant must be recognized as compensation expense even if the market condition is not achieved however the number of shares that ultimately vest can vary significantly with the performance of the specified market criteria all of the rsus we grant have dividend rights that are subject to the same vesting requirements as the underlying equity awards so we do not adjust the intrinsic market value of our rsus for dividends see note 10 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report for more information 

legal contingencies 

we are subject to certain legal proceedings as well as demands claims and threatened litigation that arise in the normal course of our business we review the status of each significant matter quarterly and assess our potential financial exposure if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated we record a liability and an expense for the estimated loss if we determine that a loss is possible and the range of the loss can be reasonably determined then we disclose the range of the possible loss significant judgment is required in the determination of whether a potential loss is probable reasonably possible or remote as well as in the determination of whether a potential exposure is reasonably estimable our accruals are based on the best information available at the time as additional information becomes available we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates potential legal liabilities and the revision of estimates of potential legal liabilities could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 

accounting for income taxes – estimates of deferred taxes valuation allowances and uncertain tax positions 

we estimate our income taxes based on the various jurisdictions where we conduct business significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax rules and the potential for future adjustment of our uncertain tax positions by the united states internal revenue service or other taxing jurisdictions we estimate our current tax liability and assess temporary differences that result from differing treatments of certain items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which we show on our balance sheet we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized to the extent we believe that realization is not likely we establish a valuation allowance when we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in an accounting period we record a corresponding tax expense in our statement of operations 

tables of contents 

at july 31 2017  we had net deferred tax assets of 125 million which included a valuation allowance of 64 million for loss and tax credit carryforwards related to state tax credits foreign losses and state operating and capital losses we recorded the valuation allowance to reflect uncertainties about whether we will be able to utilize some of our deferred tax assets before they expire while we believe our current valuation allowance is sufficient we could in the future be required to increase the valuation allowance to take into account additional deferred tax assets that we may be unable to realize we assess the need for an adjustment to the valuation allowance on a quarterly basis the assessment is based on our estimates of future sources of taxable income for the jurisdictions in which we operate and the periods over which our deferred tax assets will be realizable see note 9 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report for more information 

we recognize and measure benefits for uncertain tax positions using a twostep approach the first step is to evaluate the tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon audit including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes for tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely of being realized upon settlement significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions we evaluate our uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis our evaluations are based upon a number of factors including changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law correspondence with tax authorities during the course of audits and effective settlement of audit issues changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in material increases or decreases in our income tax expense in the period in which we make the change which could have a material impact on our effective tax rate and operating results

at july 31 2017  our cash cash equivalents and investments totaled 777 million  a decrease of 303 million from july 31 2016 due to the factors described in “statements of cash flows” below our primary sources of liquidity have been cash from operations which entails the collection of accounts receivable for products and services and borrowings under our credit facilities our primary uses of cash have been for research and development programs selling and marketing activities capital projects acquisitions of businesses debt service costs and debt repayment repurchases of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs and the payment of cash dividends as discussed in “executive overview – industry trends and seasonality” earlier in this item 7 our business is subject to significant seasonality the balance of our cash cash equivalents and investments generally fluctuates with that seasonal pattern we believe the seasonality of our business is likely to continue in the future 

the following table summarizes selected measures of our liquidity and capital resources at the dates indicated 



we have historically generated significant cash from operations and we expect to continue to do so during fiscal 2018  our cash cash equivalents and investments totaled 777 million at july 31 2017  none of those funds were restricted and approximately 68 of those funds were located in the us our unsecured revolving credit facility is available to us for general corporate purposes including future acquisitions and share repurchases at july 31 2017  no amounts were outstanding under the revolving credit facility see note 7 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report for more information in august 2017 we borrowed 285 million under the revolving credit facility for general corporate purposes and share repurchases as our cash balance in the first fiscal quarter is seasonally low 

we evaluate on an ongoing basis the merits of acquiring technology or businesses or establishing strategic relationships with and investing in other companies our strong liquidity profile enables us to respond nimbly to these kinds of opportunities 

based on past performance and current expectations we believe that our cash and cash equivalents investments and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet anticipated seasonal working capital needs capital expenditure requirements contractual obligations commitments debt service requirements and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations for at least the next 12 months we expect to return excess cash generated by operations to our stockholders through repurchases of our common stock and payment of cash dividends after taking into account our operating and strategic cash needs

 item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend

investment portfolio and interest rate risk 

we actively monitor market conditions and developments specific to the securities in which we invest we believe that we take a conservative approach to investing our funds in that we invest only in highlyrated securities and diversify our portfolio of investments while we believe we take prudent measures to mitigate investmentrelated risks such risks cannot be fully eliminated because of market circumstances that are outside our control 

our investments consist of instruments that meet quality standards that are consistent with our investment policy this policy specifies that except for direct obligations of the united states government securities issued by agencies of the united states government and money market funds we diversify our investments by limiting our holdings with any individual issuer we do not hold derivative financial instruments or european sovereign debt in our portfolio of investments see note 2 and note 3 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report for a summary of the amortized cost and fair value of our investments by type of issue 

our cash equivalents and investments are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates interest rate movements affect the interest income we earn on cash equivalents and investments and the value of those investments at july 31 2017  our cash equivalents and investments totaled 644 million and had a weighted average pretax yield of 147  total interest income for fiscal 2017 was 8 million  if the federal reserve target rate had increased by 25 basis points from the level of july 31 2017  the value of our investments at that date would have decreased by approximately 1 million if the federal reserve target rate had increased by 100 basis points from the level of july 31 2017  the value of our investments at that date would have decreased by approximately 4 million 

we are also exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates as they affect our 1 billion unsecured revolving credit facility and 500 million unsecured term loan advances under the revolving credit facility accrue interest at rates that are equal to bank of america’s alternate base rate plus a margin that ranges from 00 to 05 or the london interbank offered rate libor plus a margin that ranges from 09 to 15  the term loan accrues interest at rates that are equal to at our election either bank of americas alternate base rate plus a margin that ranges from 0125 to 0875 or libor plus a margin that ranges from 1125 to 1875 actual margins under all of these elections are based on our senior debt credit ratings consequently our interest expense fluctuates with changes in the general level of these interest rates at july 31 2017 no amounts were outstanding under the revolving credit facility and 488 million was outstanding under the term loan see note 7 and note 8 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report for more information 

impact of foreign currency rate changes 

the functional currencies of our international operating subsidiaries are generally the local currencies we translate the assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries at the exchange rates in effect on the balance sheet date we translate their revenue costs and expenses at the average rates of exchange in effect during the period we include translation gains and losses in the stockholders’ equity section of our balance sheets we include net gains and losses resulting from foreign exchange transactions in interest and other income in our statements of operations 

since we translate foreign currencies primarily canadian dollars indian rupees and british pounds into us dollars for financial reporting purposes currency fluctuations can have an impact on our financial results the historical impact of currency fluctuations on our financial results has generally been immaterial we believe that our exposure to currency exchange fluctuation risk is not significant primarily because our global subsidiaries invoice customers and satisfy their financial obligations almost exclusively in their local currencies although the impact of currency fluctuations on our financial results has generally been immaterial in the past and we believe that for the reasons cited above currency fluctuations will not be significant in the future the impact of currency fluctuations could be material in the future as of july 31 2017  we did not engage in foreign currency hedging activities

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in exchange act rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of july 31 2017 based on the guidelines established in internal control – integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso based on the results of this evaluation our management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of july 31 2017 to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles we reviewed the results of management’s assessment with the audit and risk committee of intuit’s board of directors 

ernst  young llp an independent registered public accounting firm has audited the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of july 31 2017  their report is included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

during our most recent fiscal quarter there has not occurred any change in our internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls 

our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer believes that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and that they are effective at the reasonable assurance level however no matter how well conceived and executed a control system can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met the design of any control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs there are also limitations that are inherent in any control system these limitations include the realities that breakdowns can occur because of errors in judgment or mistakes and that controls can be circumvented by individual persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls because of these inherent limitations in a cost effective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected

product development 

since the markets for software and related services are characterized by rapid technological change shifting customer needs and frequent new product introductions and enhancements a continuous high level of investment is required to innovate and quickly develop new products and services as well as enhance existing offerings our product development efforts are becoming more important than ever as we pursue our connected services strategy which reflects a world where people and businesses are increasingly connected by technology and expect access to services at any time and in any place 

we develop many of our products and services internally we have a number of united states and foreign patents and pending applications that relate to various aspects of our products and technology we supplement our internal development efforts by acquiring or licensing products and technology from third parties and establishing other relationships that enable us to enhance or expand our offerings more rapidly we expect to expand our thirdparty technology relationships as we continue to pursue our connected services strategy 

our traditional desktop software products – quickbooks turbotax lacerte and proseries – tend to have predictable annual development and product release cycles we also develop innovative new offerings including mobile applications for which development cycles are often more rapid developing consumer and professional tax software and services presents unique challenges because of the demanding development cycle required to accurately incorporate federal and state tax law and tax form changes within a rigid timetable the development timing for our small business payroll and merchant payment processing services offerings varies with business needs and regulatory requirements and the length of the development cycle depends on the scope and complexity of each project 

we continue to make substantial investments in research and development and we expect to focus our future research and development efforts on enhancing existing products and services and on developing new products and services including new mobile and global offerings we also expect to continue to focus significant research and development efforts on ongoing projects to update the technology platforms for several of our offerings our research and development expenses were 881  million or 19  of total net revenue in fiscal 2016  798 million or 19  of total net revenue in fiscal 2015  and 714 million or 17  of total net revenue in fiscal 2014  

seasonality 

our consumer tax offerings have significant seasonal patterns as a result during each of the last three fiscal years the total revenue for our third quarter ended april 30 has represented nearly half of our total revenue for those years we expect the seasonality of our consumer tax business to continue to have a significant impact on our quarterly financial results in the future 

marketing sales and distribution channels 

markets 

our primary target customers are small businesses consumers and accounting professionals the markets in which we compete have always been characterized by rapid technological change shifting customer needs and frequent new product introductions and enhancements by competitors over the past several years the widespread availability of the internet mobile devices and the explosion of social media have accelerated the pace of change and revolutionized the way that customers learn about evaluate and purchase products and services 

realtime personalized online and mobile shopping experiences have become the standard in addition many customers now begin shopping in one channel and ultimately purchase in another this has created a need for integrated multichannel shopandbuy experiences market and industry changes quickly make existing products and services obsolete our success depends on our ability to respond rapidly to these changes with new business models updated competitive strategies new or enhanced products and services alternative distribution methods and other changes in the way we do business 

marketing programs 

we use a variety of traditional and innovative marketing programs to generate orders stimulate demand and generally maintain and increase customer awareness of our product portfolio these programs include internet marketing and targeted advertising such as search engine optimization and purchasing keywords from major search engine companies placing and promoting our mobile applications in proprietary online stores directresponse mail and email campaigns telephone solicitations newspaper magazine billboard radio and television advertising social media campaigns and coordinated promotional offers with major retailers we also use workflowintegrated inproduct discovery in some of our offerings to

market other related products and services including thirdparty products and services in addition we create marketing campaigns that are designed to attract new users through trial promotional offerings 

sales and distribution channels 

multichannel shopandbuy experiences  our customers increasingly use the internet and mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets to research products and services some customers buy and use our products and services entirely online or through their mobile devices others purchase desktop products and services using the internet still others make their final decision at a retail location although retail sales of our products and services are gradually declining as online distribution channels grow in importance we continue to coordinate our websites promotions and retail displays to support an integrated multichannel shopandbuy model 

direct sales channel  we sell many of our products and services directly through our websites and call centers telesales continues to be an effective channel for serving customers that want live help to select the products and services that are right for their needs we also have a direct sales force that calls on us and international accountant firms and seeks to increase their awareness usage and recommendation of our small business solutions 

retail channel  we sell our quickbooks and turbotax desktop software as well as payroll services and merchant credit card payment processing services at retail locations across the united states we sell these products and services directly and through distributors to office supply superstores warehouse clubs consumer electronics retailers general mass merchandisers online retailers and catalogs in canada and the united kingdom we also rely on distributors and other third parties who sell products into the retail channel the retail channel provides broad customer reach through retailersponsored advertising and exposure to retail foot traffic this channel also gives us the opportunity to communicate our products services and messages through multiple touch points and allows us to serve our customers at relatively modest cost 

online mobile application stores   we distribute many of our offerings for mobile devices through proprietary online stores that provide applications for specific devices these include the apple app store which provides apps for the apple iphone and ipad and google’s play store which provides apps for androidcompatible smartphones and tablets 

other channels  we have strategies to address the alliance partner and solution provider channels we sell our consumer and small business products and services through selected alliance partners that help us reach new customers at the point of need and drive growth and market share by extending our online reach solution providers combine our products and services with valueadded marketing sales and technical expertise to deliver a complete solution at the local level as we expand our mobile and global offerings we expect that strategic partnerships will become increasingly important to our business 

competition 

overview 

we face intense competition in all of our businesses both domestically and internationally competitive interest and expertise in many of the markets we serve have grown markedly over the past few years and we expect this trend to continue some of our existing competitors have significantly greater financial technical and marketing resources than we do in addition the competitive landscape can shift rapidly as new companies enter markets in which we compete this is particularly true for online and mobile products and services where the barriers to entry are lower than they are for desktop software products and services to attract customers many online and mobile competitors are offering free or lowpriced entrylevel products which we must take into account in our pricing strategies 

our most obvious competition comes from other companies that offer technology solutions similar to ours however for many of our products and services other important competitive alternatives for customers are thirdparty service providers such as professional accountants and seasonal assisted tax preparation businesses manual tools and processes or generalpurpose software are also important competitive alternatives 

competition specific to segments 

small business segment  quickbooks is the leading small business financial management software in the us our small business desktop products and services face competitive challenges from companies such as the sage group plc which offers software and associated services that directly target small business customers our small business online products and services face competition from online accounting offerings from companies such as xero free or lowcost online accounting offerings and free online banking and bill payment services offered by financial institutions and others in our payroll business we compete directly with automatic data processing inc adp paychex and many other companies with payroll offerings including online payroll offerings in our merchant services business we compete directly with large financial institutions such

as wells fargo jp morgan chase and bank of america and with many payment processors including first data corporation elavon global payments fis paypal and square 

consumer tax segment  in our consumer tax segment our future growth depends on our ability to attract new customers to the selfpreparation tax category from tax stores and other tax preparers in the us private sector we face intense competition from hr block which provides tax preparation services in its stores and a competing software offering we also face competition from several other large tax preparation service providers from a myriad of small tax preparers and from numerous online selfpreparation offerings including blucora’s taxact in canada our turbotax canada offerings face competition from hr block simpletax studiotax and ufile these competing offerings subject us to significant price pressure in both the us and canada 

we also face competitive challenges from publicly funded government entities that offer electronic tax preparation and filing services at no cost to individual taxpayers we are a member of the free file alliance a consortium of private sector companies that has entered into an agreement with the federal government under this agreement the member companies provide online federal tax preparation and filing services at no cost to eligible federal taxpayers and the federal government has agreed not to provide a competing service approximately 22 states have also adopted free file alliance publicprivate agreements while approximately 20 other states offer some form of direct government tax preparation and filing services free to qualified taxpayers we continue to actively work with others in the private and public sectors to advance the goals of the free file alliance policy initiative and to support successful publicprivate partnerships however future administrative regulatory or legislative activity in this area could harm our consumer tax business 

proconnect segment  in the us lacerte professional tax offerings face competition from competitivelypriced tax and accounting solutions that include integration with nontax functionality these include cch’s prosystems fx office suite and thomson reuters’ cs professional suite and gosystems tax our proseries professional tax offerings face competition from cch’s atx and taxwise offerings drake and other smaller providers in canada our profile professional tax offerings face competition from cch’s cantax and taxprep offerings and from thomson reuters’ dtmax and ufile pro offerings we also face growing competition from online tax and accounting offerings in the us and canada which may be marketed more effectively or have lower pricing than our offerings for accounting professionals 

competitive factors 

we believe the most important competitive factors for our core offerings – quickbooks turbotax lacerte and proseries – are ease of use product features size of the installed customer base brand name recognition value proposition cost reliability and product and support quality access to distribution channels is also important for our quickbooks and turbotax software products in addition support from accounting professionals and the ability for customers to upgrade within product families as their businesses grow are significant competitive factors for our quickbooks products productivity is an important competitive factor for the fullservice accounting firms to which we market our lacerte software products we believe we compete effectively on these factors as our quickbooks and turbotax products are the leading products in the us for their respective categories 

for our service offerings such as small business payroll and merchant payment processing we believe the most important competitive factors are functionality ease of use high availability the integration of these products with related software brand name recognition effective distribution quality of support and cost 

customer service and technical support 

we provide customer service and technical support by telephone email online chat text messaging online communities and our customer service and technical support websites we have fulltime and outsourced customer service and technical support staffs we supplement these staffs with seasonal employees and additional outsourcing during periods of peak call volumes such as during the tax return filing season or following a major product launch we outsource to several firms domestically and internationally most of our internationally outsourced small business customer service and technical support personnel are currently located in india and the philippines 

we offer free selfhelp information through our technical support websites for our quickbooks turbotax and proconnect offerings customers can also use our websites to find answers to commonly asked questions and check on the status of orders under certain paid support plans customers can also use our websites to receive product updates electronically support alternatives and fees vary by product we sponsor online user communities such as intuit community for small businesses and accounting professionals and turbotax answer exchange where consumers can share knowledge and product advice with each other we also offer live tax advice from usbased tax professionals to us turbotax users

manufacturing and distribution 

online products and services 

intuit’s data centers house most of the systems networks and databases required to operate and deliver our online products and services these include quickbooks online online payroll services merchant payment processing services turbotax online proconnect tax online and consumer and professional electronic tax filing services through our data centers we connect customers to our products and services and store customer and business information as our businesses continue to move toward delivering more online and mobile products and services in conjunction with our connected services strategy we expect that our infrastructure will become even more critical to our business in the future 

our primary data centers are a facility we own in washington state and a colocated data center in nevada we also have a number of other data centers that are primarily located in the western united states and canada we continue to execute on a multiyear plan to transition to fewer data centers in more geographically diverse locations in addition we have an enterprise agreement with amazon web services and over time will be hosting an increasing number of our applications and services in their secure online environment 

desktop software and supplies 

although an increasing proportion of our desktop software customers choose to electronically download software many customers continue to choose to purchase these products in the form of physical media the key processes in manufacturing desktop software are manufacturing compact discs cds and digital video discs dvds printing boxes and related materials and assembling and shipping the final products 

for retail manufacturing we have an agreement with arvato digital services inc a division of bertelsmann ag under which arvato provides a majority of the manufacturing volume for our launches of quickbooks and turbotax as well as for daytoday replenishment after product launches arvato has operations in multiple locations that can provide redundancy if necessary 

for retail distribution we have an agreement with arvato under which arvato handles all logistics services our retail product launches are operationally complex our model for product delivery for retail launches and replenishment is a hybrid of direct to store deliveries and shipments to central warehouse locations this allows improved inventory management by our retailers we also ship products for many of our smaller retail customers through distributors 

arvato also provides most of the manufacturing volume and distribution services for our direct desktop software orders we have an exclusive agreement with harland clarke a division of mf worldwide corporation to fulfill orders for all of our printed checks and most other products for our financial supplies business 

we have multiple sources for all of our raw materials and availability has historically not been a significant problem for us we continue to see consolidation among cddvd suppliers and reduced demand overall for this media type as a result we believe cddvd media may become more difficult and more costly to obtain in the near future 

we typically ship products within a few days of receiving an order and backlog is minimal 

privacy and security of customer and employee information and transactions 

we are subject to various federal state and international laws and regulations and to financial institution and healthcare provider requirements relating to the privacy and security of customer and employee personal information we are also subject to laws and regulations that apply to the internet behavioral tracking and advertising mobile applications and messaging telemarketing email activities data transfer data hosting and retention financial and health information financial transactions and credit reporting additional laws in all of these areas are likely to be passed in the future which could result in significant limitations on or changes to the ways in which we can collect use host store or transmit the personal information and data of our customers or employees communicate with our customers and deliver products and services to customers or employees or may significantly increase our compliance costs as our business expands to new industry segments and new uses of data that are regulated for privacy and security or to countries outside the united states that have strict data protections laws our compliance requirements and costs will increase 

we are the stewards of our customers’ data through a master privacy policy framework designed to be consistent with globally recognized privacy principles we comply with united states federal and other country guidelines and practices to help ensure that customers and employees are aware of and can control how we use information about them our primary websites and online products such as intuitcom quickbooks and turbotax have been certified by truste an independent organization that operates a website and online product privacy certification program representing industry standard practices to address users’ and regulators’ concerns about online privacy we also use privacy statements to provide notice to customers

tables of contents 

of our privacy practices as well as provide them the opportunity to furnish instructions with respect to use of their personal information we participate in industry groups whose purpose is to develop or shape industry best practices and to influence public policy for privacy and security 

to address security concerns we use security safeguards to help protect the systems and the information customers and employees give to us from loss misuse and unauthorized alteration whenever customers transmit sensitive information such as credit card information or tax return data through one of our websites or products we use industry standards to encrypt the data as it is transmitted to us we work to protect our systems from unauthorized internal or external access using numerous commercially available computer security products as well as internally developed security procedures and practices 

government regulation 

our consumer tax and proconnect segments are subject to federal and state government requirements including regulations related to the electronic filing of tax returns the provision of tax preparer assistance and the use and disclosure of customer information in addition we offer certain other products and services to small businesses and consumers such as payroll payments and financing which are also subject to regulatory requirements as we expand our products and services both domestically and internationally we may become subject to additional government regulation further regulators may adopt new laws or regulations or their interpretation of existing laws or regulations may differ from ours or expand to cover additional products and services these increased regulatory requirements could impose significant limitations on our business and increase our cost of compliance 

we are subject to federal and state laws and government regulations concerning employee safety and health and environmental matters the occupational safety and health administration the environmental protection agency and other federal and state agencies have the authority to put regulations in place that may have an impact on our operations 

intellectual property 

our success depends on the proprietary technology embodied in our offerings we protect this proprietary technology by relying on a variety of intellectual property mechanisms including copyright patent trade secret and trademark laws restrictions on disclosure and other methods for example we regularly file applications for patents copyrights and trademarks and service marks in order to protect intellectual property that we believe is important to our business we hold a growing patent portfolio that we believe is important to intuit’s overall competitive advantage although we are not materially dependent on any one patent or particular group of patents in our portfolio at this time we also have a number of registered trademarks that include intuit quickbooks turbotax lacerte proseries and mint we have registered these and other trademarks and service marks in the united states and depending on the relevance of each brand to other markets in many foreign countries most registrations can be renewed perpetually at 10year intervals we also license intellectual property from third parties for use in our products 

although our portfolio of patents is growing the patents that have been issued to us could be determined to be invalid and may not be enforceable against competitive products in every jurisdiction in addition third parties have asserted and may in the future assert infringement claims against us and our customers these claims and any litigation may result in invalidation of our proprietary rights or a finding of infringement along with an assessment of damages litigation even if without merit could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention in addition thirdparty licenses may not continue to be available to us on commercially acceptable terms or at all 

employees 

as of july 31 2016  we had approximately 7900  fulltime employees in major offices in the united states canada india the united kingdom and other locations we also employ a significant number of seasonal and contract employees during the second and third quarters of our fiscal years to support our consumer tax customers for example at the peak of the 2015  tax season we employed approximately 1100  seasonal employees we believe our future success and growth will depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees in all areas of our business we do not currently have any collective bargaining agreements with our employees and we believe employee relations are generally good although we have employmentrelated agreements with a number of key employees these agreements do not guarantee continued service we believe we offer competitive compensation and a good working environment we were named one of fortune  magazine’s “100 best companies to work for” in each of the last fifteen years however we face intense competition for qualified employees and we expect to face continuing challenges in recruiting and retention

we caution investors that forwardlooking statements are only predictions based on our current expectations about future events and are not guarantees of future performance we encourage you to read carefully all information provided in this report and in our other filings with the sec before deciding to invest in our stock or to maintain or change your investment these forwardlooking statements are based on information as of the filing date of this annual report and we undertake no obligation to revise or update any forwardlooking statement for any reason 

because forwardlooking statements involve risks and uncertainties there are important factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forwardlooking statements these factors include the following 

we face intense competitive pressures that may harm our operating results 

we face intense competition in all of our businesses and we expect competition to remain intense in the future our competitors and potential competitors range from large and established entities to emerging startups our competitors may introduce superior products and services reduce prices have greater technical marketing and other resources have greater name recognition have larger installed bases of customers have wellestablished relationships with our current and potential customers advertise aggressively or beat us to market with new products and services in addition we may face competition from existing companies with large established consumer userbases and broadbased platforms who may change or expand the focus of their business strategies and marketing to target our customers including small businesses and tax customers we also face intensified competition from providers of free accounting tax payments and other financial services in order to compete we have also introduced free offerings in several categories but we may not be able to attract customers or effectively monetize all of these offerings and customers who have formerly paid for intuit’s products and services may elect to use free offerings instead these competitive factors may diminish our revenue and profitability and harm our ability to acquire and retain customers 

our consumer tax business also faces significant competition from the public sector where we face the risk of federal and state taxing authorities developing software or other systems to facilitate tax return preparation and electronic filing at no charge to taxpayers these or similar programs may be introduced or expanded in the future which may cause us to lose customers and revenue although the free file alliance has kept the federal government from being a direct competitor to intuit’s tax offerings it has fostered additional online competition and may cause us to lose significant revenue opportunities the current agreement with the free file alliance is scheduled to expire in october 2020 we anticipate that governmental encroachment at both the federal and state levels may present a continued competitive threat to our business for the foreseeable future 

future revenue growth depends upon our ability to adapt to technological change as well as global trends in the way customers access consumer software offerings and successfully introduce new and enhanced products services and business models 

online offerings desktop software and mobile technology industries are characterized by rapidly changing technology evolving industry standards and frequent new product introductions as we continue to grow our online mobile and other offerings we must continue to innovate and develop new products and features to meet changing customer needs and attract and retain talented software developers we need to continue to develop our skills tools and capabilities to capitalize on existing and emerging technologies which require us to devote significant resources 

our consumer and professional tax businesses depend significantly on revenue from customers who return each year to use our updated tax preparation and filing software and services as our existing products mature encouraging customers to purchase product upgrades becomes more challenging unless new product releases provide features and functionality that have meaningful incremental value if we are not able to develop and clearly demonstrate the value of new or upgraded products or services to our customers our revenues may be harmed in addition as we continue to introduce and expand our new business models including offerings that are free to end users we may be unsuccessful in monetizing or increasing customer adoption of these offerings 

the number of people who access products and services through devices other than personal computers including mobile phones smartphones and handheld computers such as tablets continues to increase we have devoted significant resources to develop products and services for users of these alternative devices but the versions of our products and services developed for these devices may not be compelling to users even if we are able to attract new users through these mobile offerings the amount of revenue that we derive per user from mobile offerings may be less than the revenue that we have historically derived from users of personal computers as new devices and new platforms are continually being released it is difficult to predict the problems we may encounter in developing versions of our products and services for use on these alternative devices and we may need to devote significant resources to the creation support and maintenance of such offerings if we are slow to develop products and technologies that are compatible with these alternative devices or if our competitors are able to achieve those

results more quickly than us we will fail to capture a significant share of an increasingly important portion of the market for online services which could adversely affect our business 

in some cases we may expend a significant amount of resources and management attention on offerings that do not ultimately succeed in their markets we have encountered difficulty in launching new products and services in the past if we misjudge customer needs in the future our new products and services may not succeed and our revenues and earnings may be harmed we have also invested and in the future expect to invest in new business models geographies strategies and initiatives such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties including distraction of management from current operations expenses associated with the initiatives and inadequate return on investments because these new initiatives are inherently risky they may not be successful and may harm our financial condition and operating results 

business interruption or failure of our information technology and communication systems may impair the availability of our products and services which may damage our reputation and harm our future financial results 

as we continue to transition our business to more connected services we become more dependent on the continuing operation and availability of our information technology and communication systems and those of our external service providers including for example thirdparty internetbased or “cloud” computing services we do not have redundancy for all of our systems many of our critical applications reside in only one of our data centers and our disaster recovery planning may not account for all eventualities in the event of significant system disruption we may experience loss of data or processing capabilities which may cause us to lose customers and may materially harm our reputation and our operating results in addition we are in the process of updating our customer facing applications and the supporting information technology infrastructure to meet our customers’ expectations for continuous service availability any difficulties in upgrading these applications or infrastructure or failure of our systems or those of our thirdparty service providers may result in interruptions in our service which may reduce our revenues and profits cause us to lose customers and damage our reputation any prolonged interruptions at any time may result in lost customers additional refunds of customer charges negative publicity and increased operating costs any of which may significantly harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

our turbotax business must effectively handle extremely heavy customer demand during critical peak periods from january until april of each year we face significant risks in maintaining adequate service levels during these peak periods where we derive a substantial portion of our overall revenue from the turbotax business any interruptions in our online tax preparation or electronic filing service at any time during the tax season particularly during a peak period could result in significantly decreased revenue lost customers additional refunds of customer charges negative publicity and increased operating costs any of which could significantly harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are in the process of migrating our applications and infrastructure to new data centers and to thirdparty hosted environments if we do not execute the transition to these new environments in an effective manner we may experience unplanned service disruptions or unforeseen increases in costs which may harm our operating results and our business 

our business operations data centers information technology and communications systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters human error malicious attacks fire power loss telecommunications failures computer viruses computer denial of service attacks terrorist attacks and other events beyond our control the majority of our activities our corporate headquarters our principal information technology systems and other critical business operations are located near major seismic faults we do not carry earthquake insurance for direct quakerelated losses our future financial results may be materially harmed in the event of a major earthquake or other natural or manmade disaster 

we rely on internal systems and external systems maintained by manufacturers distributors and other service providers to take and fulfill customer orders handle customer service requests and host certain online activities any interruption or failure of our internal or external systems may prevent us or our service providers from accepting and fulfilling customer orders or cause company and customer data to be unintentionally disclosed our continuing efforts to upgrade and expand our network security and other information systems as well as our highavailability capabilities may be costly and problems with the design or implementation of system enhancements may harm our business and our results of operations 

a security breach resulting in thirdparty access to our sensitive customer and employee information and data could materially disrupt our businesses result in the disclosure of confidential information significantly damage our reputation subject us to costly litigation and cause material losses 

we host collect use and retain large amounts of sensitive and personal customer and employee information and data including credit card information tax return information bank account numbers and passwords personal and business financial data and transactions social security numbers healthcare information and payroll information we and our vendors use commercially

tables of contents 

available security technologies to protect this information and data and we also use security and business controls to limit access to and use of such sensitive and personal customer information and data however such measures cannot provide absolute security and we have experienced instances in the past where criminals using stolen identity information obtained outside of our systems have gained unauthorized and illegal access to our customers’ data as the accessibility of stolen identity information increases we may experience additional instances of unauthorized and illegal access to our systems using our customers’ stolen identity information in the future in addition third parties may fraudulently induce employees customers or users to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data or customers’ data the security measures that we implement may not be able to prevent access to our systems from unauthorized users who have fraudulently obtained our customers’ personal information in addition because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access change frequently and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventive measures a major breach of our security measures or those of third parties that provide hosting services or have access to our sensitive and personal customer information may have serious negative consequences for our businesses including possible litigation fines penalties and damages material harm to our reputation and brands further regulation and oversight by federal or state agencies and loss of our ability to provide financial transaction services or accept and process customer credit card orders or tax returns 

our technologies systems and networks and our customers’ devices have been subject to and are likely to continue to be the target of cyberattacks computer viruses worms phishing attacks malicious software programs and other information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release gathering monitoring misuse loss or destruction of our customers’ or employees’ sensitive and personal information and data or otherwise disrupt our or our customers’ or other third parties’ business operations and customers that fail to update theirs systems continue to run software that we no longer support or that fail to install security patches on a timely basis make it more difficult for us to detect and prevent these kinds of attacks although this is an industrywide problem that affects software across platforms it is increasingly affecting our offerings because cybercriminals tend to focus their efforts on wellknown offerings that are popular among customers and we expect them to continue to do so if these cybercriminals are able to circumvent our security measures exploit vulnerabilities in our customers’ devices or customers’ behavior or if we are unable to detect an intrusion into our systems and contain such intrusion in a reasonable amount of time our customers’ sensitive and personal information and data may be compromised which could lead to litigation with our customers fines penalties and other damages 

in addition our employees contractors temporary and seasonal employees may have access to sensitive and personal information of our customers and employees while we conduct background checks of our employees and these other individuals and limit access to systems and data it is possible that one or more of these individuals may circumvent these controls resulting in accidental or intentional disclosure or misuse of our customers’ or employees’ data in addition we rely on thirdparty vendors to host certain of our sensitive and personal information and data while we conduct due diligence on these thirdparty partners with respect to their security and business controls we may not have the ability to effectively monitor or oversee the implementation of these controls measures and in any event individuals or third parties may be able to circumvent these security and business controls andor exploit vulnerabilities that may exist in these controls resulting in the disclosure or misuse of sensitive and personal customer or employee information and data 

privacy and cybersecurity concerns relating to online offerings including our offerings specifically as well as the external environment generally could damage our reputation and deter current and potential customers from adopting our products and services 

from time to time we detect or receive notices from customers or public or private agencies that they have detected actual or perceived vulnerabilities in our servers our software or thirdparty software components that are distributed with our products or fraudulent activity by unauthorized persons utilizing our products with stolen customer identity information the existence of such vulnerabilities or fraudulent activity even if they do not result in a security breach may undermine customer confidence as well as the confidence of government agencies that regulate our offerings as we further transition our businesses to online and connected services continue to collect more personal and sensitive information and operate in more countries the risk that perceived vulnerabilities of our systems could seriously harm our business by tarnishing our reputation and brand andor limiting the adoption of our products and services is likely to increase 

in addition the continued occurrence of cyberattacks and data breaches on governments businesses and consumers in general indicates we operate in an external environment where cyberattacks and data breaches are becoming increasingly common if the global cybersecurity environment worsens and there are increased instances of security breaches of thirdparty offerings where consumers’ data and sensitive information is compromised consumers may be less willing to use online offerings particularly offerings like ours where customers often share sensitive financial data this could damage our reputation and deter current and potential customers from adopting our products and services or lead customers to cease using online and connected software products to transact financial business altogether

if we are unable to develop manage and maintain critical thirdparty business relationships our business may be adversely affected 

our growth is dependent on the strength of our business relationships and our ability to continue to develop maintain and leverage new and existing relationships we rely on various thirdparty partners including software and service providers suppliers vendors manufacturers distributors contractors financial institutions core processors licensing partners and development partners among others in many areas of our business in order to deliver our offerings and operate our business we also rely on third parties to support the operation of our business by maintaining our physical facilities equipment power systems and infrastructure in certain instances these thirdparty relationships are sole source or limited source relationships and can be difficult to replace or substitute depending on the level of integration of the third party’s products or services into or with our offerings andor the general availability of such third party’s products and services in addition there may be few or no alternative thirdparty providers or vendors in the market further there can be no assurance that we will be able to adequately retain thirdparty contractors engaged to help us operate our business the failure of third parties to provide acceptable and high quality products services and technologies or to update their products services and technologies may result in a disruption to our business operations and our customers which may reduce our revenues and profits cause us to lose customers and damage our reputation alternative arrangements and services may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or we may experience business interruptions upon a transition to an alternative partner 

in particular we have relationships with banks credit unions and other financial institutions that support certain critical services we offer to our customers if macroeconomic conditions or other factors cause any of these institutions to fail consolidate stop providing certain services or institute costcutting efforts our business and financial results may suffer and we may be unable to offer those services to our customers 

we have also started to increasingly utilize the distribution platforms of third parties like apple’s app store and google’s play store for the distribution of certain of our product offerings although we benefit from the strong brand recognition and large user base of these distribution platforms to attract new customers the platform owners have wide discretion to change the pricing structure terms of service and other policies with respect to us and other developers any adverse changes by these third parties could adversely affect our financial results     

increased government regulation of our businesses may harm our operating results 

the company is subject to federal state and local laws and regulations that affect the company’s activities including without limitation areas of labor advertising tax financial services data privacy and security requirements digital content consumer protection real estate billing ecommerce promotions quality of services intellectual property ownership and infringement import and export requirements anticorruption foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions anticompetition environmental health and safety there have been significant new regulations and heightened focus by the government on many of these areas as well as in areas such as insurance and healthcare including for example the affordable care act recent legal developments in the european union have created compliance uncertainty and increased complexity regarding certain transfers of information from europe to the us in addition governmental authorities around the world are considering a number of of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection due to the uncertain international environment we could acquire additional compliance obligations that could cause us to incur costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business a s we expand our products and services and revise our business models both domestically and internationally we may become subject to additional government regulation or increased regulatory scrutiny further regulators may adopt new laws or regulations or their interpretation of existing laws or regulations may differ from ours as well as the laws of other jurisdictions in which we operate these regulatory requirements could impose significant limitations require changes to our business require notification to customers or employees of a security breach restrict our use or storage of personal information or cause changes in customer purchasing behavior which may make our business more costly less efficient or impossible to conduct and may require us to modify our current or future products or services which may harm our future financial results for example as our business continues to expand to new industry segments that may be more highly regulated for privacy and data security and to countries outside the united states that have more strict data protection laws our compliance requirements and costs may increase we have incurred – and may continue to incur – significant expenses to comply with mandatory privacy and security standards and protocols imposed by law regulation industry standards or contractual obligations 

the tax preparation industry continues to receive heightened attention from federal and state governments new legislation regulation public policy considerations changes in the cybersecurity environment litigation by the government or private entities or new interpretations of existing laws may result in greater oversight of the tax preparation industry restrict the types of products and services that we can offer or the prices we can charge or otherwise cause us to change the way we operate our 

 17 

tables of contents 

tax businesses or offer our tax products and services we may not be able to respond quickly to such regulatory legislative and other developments and these changes may in turn increase our cost of doing business and limit our revenue opportunities in addition if our practices are not consistent with new interpretations of existing laws we may become subject to lawsuits penalties and other liabilities that did not previously apply we are also required to comply with a variety of state revenue agency standards in order to successfully operate our tax preparation and electronic filing services changes in stateimposed requirements by one or more of the states including the required use of specific technologies or technology standards may significantly increase the costs of providing those services to our customers and may prevent us from delivering a quality product to our customers in a timely manner 

if we fail to process transactions effectively or fail to adequately protect against disputed or potential fraudulent activities our revenue and earnings may be harmed 

our operations process a significant volume and dollar value of transactions on a daily basis especially in our payroll and payments businesses due to the size and volume of transactions that we handle effective processing systems and controls are essential to ensure that transactions are handled appropriately despite our efforts it is possible that we may make errors or that funds may be misappropriated due to fraud the systems supporting our business are comprised of multiple technology platforms that are difficult to scale if we are unable to effectively manage our systems and processes we may be unable to process customer data in an accurate reliable and timely manner which may harm our business in our payments processing service business if merchants for whom we process payment transactions are unable to pay refunds due to their customers in connection with disputed or fraudulent merchant transactions we may be required to pay those amounts and our payments may exceed the amount of the customer reserves we have established to make such payments 

if we are unable to effectively combat the increasing amount and sophistication of fraudulent activities by third parties using our offerings we may suffer losses which may be substantial and lose the confidence of our customers and government agencies and our revenues and earnings may be harmed 

the online tax preparation payroll administration and online payments industries have been experiencing an increasing amount of fraudulent activities by third parties and those fraudulent activities are becoming increasingly sophisticated although we do not believe that any of this activity is uniquely targeted at our products or business this type of fraudulent activity may adversely impact our consumer tax payroll and payments businesses in addition to any losses that may result from such fraud which may be substantial a loss of confidence by our customers or by governmental agencies in our ability to prevent fraudulent activity that is perpetrated through our offerings may seriously harm our business and damage our brand if we cannot adequately combat such fraudulent activity that is perpetrated through our tax offerings governmental authorities may refuse to allow us to continue to offer such services which could include federal or state tax authorities refusing to allow us to process our customers’ tax returns electronically resulting in a significant adverse impact on our earnings and revenue as fraudulent activities become more pervasive and increasingly sophisticated and fraud detection and prevention measures must become correspondingly more complex to combat them across the various industries in which we operate we may implement risk control mechanisms that could make it more difficult for legitimate customers to obtain and use our products which could result in lost revenue and negatively impact our earnings 

  

third parties claiming that we infringe their proprietary rights may cause us to incur significant legal expenses and prevent us from selling our products 

we may become increasingly subject to infringement claims including patent copyright trade secret and trademark infringement claims litigation may be necessary to determine the validity and scope of the intellectual property rights of others we have received a number of allegations of intellectual property infringement claims in the past and expect to receive more claims in the future based on allegations that our offerings infringe upon the intellectual property held by third parties some of these claims are the subject of pending litigation against us and against some of our customers these claims may involve patent holding companies or other adverse intellectual property owners who have no relevant product revenues of their own and against whom our own intellectual property may provide little or no deterrence the ultimate outcome of any allegation is uncertain and regardless of outcome any such claim with or without merit may be time consuming to defend result in costly litigation divert management’s time and attention from our business require us to stop selling delay shipping or redesign our products or require us to pay monetary damages for royalty or licensing fees or to satisfy indemnification obligations that we have with some of our customers our failure to obtain necessary license or other rights or litigation arising out of intellectual property claims may harm our business 

we rely on thirdparty intellectual property in our products and services 

many of our products and services include intellectual property of third parties which we license under agreements that may need to be renewed or renegotiated from time to time we may not be able to obtain licenses to these thirdparty technologies or 

 18 

tables of contents 

content on reasonable terms or at all if we are unable to obtain the rights necessary to use this intellectual property in our products and services we may not be able to sell the affected offerings and customers who are currently using the affected product may be disrupted which may in turn harm our future financial results damage our brand and result in customer loss also we and our customers have been and may continue to be subject to infringement claims as a result of the thirdparty intellectual property incorporated in to our offerings although we try to mitigate this risk and we may not be ultimately liable for any potential infringement pending claims require us to use significant resources require management attention and could result in loss of customers 

some of our offerings include thirdparty software that is licensed under socalled “open source” licenses some of which may include a requirement that under certain circumstances we make available or grant licenses to any modifications or derivative works we create based upon the open source software although we have established internal review and approval processes to mitigate these risks we may not be sure that all open source software is submitted for approval prior to use in our products many of the risks associated with usage of open source may not be eliminated and may if not properly addressed harm our business 

our intellectual property rights are valuable and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products services and brand 

our patents trademarks trade secrets copyrights and other intellectual property rights are important assets for us we aggressively protect our intellectual property rights by relying on federal state and common law rights in the us and internationally as well as a variety of administrative procedures we also rely on contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary rights in products and services the efforts that we take to protect our proprietary rights may not always be sufficient or effective protecting our intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming and may not be successful in every location any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business our brand and our ability to compete 

policing unauthorized use and copying of our products is difficult expensive and time consuming current us laws that prohibit copying give us only limited practical protection from software piracy and the laws of many other countries provide very little protection we frequently encounter unauthorized copies of our software being sold through online marketplaces although we continue to evaluate and put in place technology solutions to attempt to lessen the impact of piracy and engage in efforts to educate consumers and public policy leaders on these issues and cooperate with industry groups in their efforts to combat piracy we expect piracy to be a persistent problem that results in lost revenues and increased expenses 

because competition for our key employees is intense we may not be able to attract retain and develop the highly skilled employees we need to support our planned growth 

much of our future success depends on the continued service and availability of skilled personnel including members of our executive team and those in technical marketing and staff positions experienced personnel in the software mobile technologies data science data security and software as a service industries are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense especially in california and india where the majority of our employees are located also as we strive to continue to adapt to technological change and introduce new and enhanced products and business models we must be able to secure maintain and develop the right quality and quantity of engaged and committed talent although we strive to be an employer of choice we may not be able to continue to successfully attract retain and develop key personnel which may cause our business to suffer 

the nature of our products and services necessitates timely product launches and if we experience significant product quality problems or delays it may harm our revenue earnings and reputation 

all of our tax products and many of our nontax products have rigid development timetables that increase the risk of errors in our products and the risk of launch delays our tax preparation software product development cycle is particularly challenging due to the need to incorporate unpredictable tax law and tax form changes each year and because our customers expect high levels of accuracy and a timely launch of these products to prepare and file their taxes by the tax filing deadline due to the complexity of our products and the condensed development cycles under which we operate our products sometimes contain glitches that may unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the software the complexity of our products may also make it difficult for us to consistently deliver offerings that contain the features functionality and level of accuracy that our customers expect when we encounter problems we may be required to modify our code distribute patches to customers who have already purchased the product and recall or repackage existing product inventory in our distribution channels if we encounter development challenges or discover errors in our products late in our development cycle it may cause us to delay our product launch date any major defects or launch delays may lead to loss of customers and revenue negative publicity customer and employee dissatisfaction reduced retailer shelf space and promotions and increased operating expenses such as inventory

replacement costs legal fees or payments resulting from our commitment to reimburse penalties and interest paid by customers due solely to calculation errors in our consumer tax preparation products 

our consumer tax business is highly seasonal and our quarterly results could fluctuate significantly 

our consumer tax offerings have significant seasonal patterns revenue from income tax preparation products and services is heavily concentrated during november through april this seasonality has caused significant fluctuations in our quarterly financial results our financial results may also fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year due to a variety of factors including factors that may affect the timing of revenue recognition these include changes to our offerings that result in the inclusion or exclusion of ongoing services changes in product pricing strategies or product sales mix the timing of the availability of federal and state tax forms from taxing agencies and the ability of those agencies to receive electronic tax return submissions changes in consumer behavior and the timing of our discontinuation of support for older product offerings other factors that may affect our quarterly or annual financial results include the timing of acquisitions divestitures and goodwill and acquired intangible asset impairment charges any fluctuations in our operating results may adversely affect our stock price 

we are frequently a party to litigation and regulatory inquiries which could result in an unfavorable outcome and have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operation and cash flows 

we are subject to various legal proceedings including class action lawsuits claims and regulatory inquiries that have arisen out of the ordinary conduct of our business and are not yet resolved and additional claims and inquiries may arise in the future the number and significance of these claims and inquiries have increased as our businesses have evolved any proceedings claims or inquiries initiated by or against us whether successful or not may be time consuming result in costly litigation damage awards consent decrees injunctive relief or increased costs of business require us to change our business practices or products require significant amounts of management time result in diversion of significant operations resources or otherwise harm our business and future financial results 

adverse global economic conditions could harm our business and financial condition 

adverse macroeconomic developments could negatively affect our business and financial condition adverse global economic events have caused and could in the future cause disruptions and volatility in global financial markets and increased rates of default and bankruptcy and could impact consumer and small business spending in particular because the majority of our revenue is derived from sales within the us economic conditions in the us have an even greater impact on us than companies with a more diverse international presence challenging economic times could cause potential new customers not to purchase or to delay purchasing of our products and services and could cause our existing customers to discontinue purchasing or delay upgrades of our existing products and services thereby negatively impacting our revenues and future financial results decreased consumer spending levels could also reduce credit and debit card transaction processing volumes causing reductions in our payments revenue poor economic conditions and high unemployment have caused and could in the future cause a significant decrease in the number of tax returns filed which may have a significant effect on the number of tax returns we prepare and file in addition weakness in the enduser consumer and small business markets could negatively affect the cash flow of our distributors and resellers who could in turn delay paying their obligations to us which could increase our credit risk exposure and cause delays in our recognition of revenue or future sales to these customers any of these events could harm our business and our future financial results 

we regularly invest resources to update and improve our internal information technology systems and software platforms should our investments not succeed or if delays or other issues with new or existing internal technology systems and software platforms disrupt our operations our business could be harmed 

we rely on our network and data center infrastructure and internal technology systems for many of our development marketing operational support sales accounting and financial reporting activities we are continually investing resources to update and improve these systems and environments in order to meet existing as well as the growing and changing requirements of our business and customers if we experience prolonged delays or unforeseen difficulties in updating and upgrading our systems and architecture we may experience outages and may not be able to deliver certain offerings and develop new offerings and enhancements that we need to remain competitive such improvements and upgrades are often complex costly and time consuming in addition such improvements can be challenging to integrate with our existing technology systems or may uncover problems with our existing technology systems unsuccessful implementation of hardware or software updates and improvements could result in outages disruption in our business operations loss of revenue or damage to our reputation

our international operations are subject to increased risks which may harm our business operating results and financial condition 

in addition to uncertainty about our ability to generate revenues from our foreign operations and expand into international markets there are risks inherent in doing business internationally including 

 violations of the rapidly evolving and complex foreign and us laws and regulations that apply to our international operations may result in fines criminal actions or sanctions against us our officers or our employees prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with these laws there can be no assurance that our employees contractors or agents will not violate our policies these risks inherent in our international operations and expansion increase our costs of doing business internationally and may result in harm to our business operating results and financial condition 

if actual product returns exceed returns reserves our future financial results may be harmed 

we ship more desktop software products to our distributors and retailers than we expect them to sell in order to reduce the risk that distributors or retailers may run out of products this is particularly true for our consumer tax products which have a short selling season and for which returns occur primarily in our fiscal third and fourth quarters like many software companies that sell their products through distributors and retailers we have historically accepted significant product returns we establish reserves against revenue for product returns in our financial statements based on estimated returns and we closely monitor product sales and inventory in the retail channel in an effort to maintain adequate reserves in the past returns have not differed significantly from these reserves however if we experience actual returns that significantly exceed reserves it may result in lower net revenue 

unanticipated changes in our income tax rates may affect our future financial results 

our future effective income tax rates may be favorably or unfavorably affected by unanticipated changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or by changes in tax laws or their interpretation in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes these continuous examinations may result in unforeseen taxrelated liabilities which may harm our future financial results

amortization of acquired intangible assets and impairment charges may cause significant fluctuation in our net income 

our acquisitions have resulted in significant expenses including amortization and impairment of acquired technology and other acquired intangible assets and impairment of goodwill total costs and expenses in these categories were 34 million in fiscal 2016  339 million in fiscal 2015  of which 149 million was classified as discontinued operations and 25 million in fiscal 2014  although under current accounting rules goodwill is not amortized we may incur impairment charges related to the goodwill already recorded and to goodwill arising out of future acquisitions we test the impairment of goodwill annually in our fourth fiscal quarter or more frequently if indicators of impairment arise the timing of the formal annual test may result in charges to our statement of operations in our fourth fiscal quarter that may not have been reasonably foreseen in prior periods the total costs and expenses for fiscal 2015 included goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges of 297 million of which 149 million was classified as discontinued operations at july 31 2016  we had 13 billion  in goodwill and 44  million in net acquired intangible assets on our balance sheet both of which may be subject to impairment charges in the future new acquisitions and any impairment of the value of acquired intangible assets may have a significant negative impact on our future financial results 

our acquisition and divestiture activities may disrupt our ongoing business may involve increased expenses and may present risks not contemplated at the time of the transactions 

we have acquired and may continue to acquire companies products and technologies that complement our strategic direction acquisitions involve significant risks and uncertainties including 

 we have divested and may in the future divest certain assets or businesses that no longer fit with our strategic direction or growth targets divestitures involve significant risks and uncertainties including

tables of contents 

because acquisitions and divestitures are inherently risky our transactions may not be successful and may in some cases harm our operating results or financial condition although we typically fund our acquisitions through cash available from operations if we were to use debt to fund acquisitions or for other purposes our interest expense and leverage would increase significantly and if we were to issue equity securities as consideration in an acquisition current shareholders’ percentage ownership and earnings per share would be diluted 

we have 1 billion in debt outstanding and may incur other debt in the future which may adversely affect our financial condition and future financial results 

in fiscal 2007 we issued 500 million in senior unsecured notes due in march 2017 as the debt matures we will have to expend significant resources to either repay or refinance these notes if we decide to refinance the notes we may be required to do so on different or less favorable terms or we may be unable to refinance the notes at all both of which may adversely affect our financial condition 

on february 1 2016 we entered into a master credit agreement with certain institutional lenders for a new fiveyear credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of 15 billion the master credit agreement includes a 500 million unsecured term loan and a 1 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that will expire on february 1 2021 as of july 31 2016  500 million was outstanding on the term loan and no amounts were outstanding under the revolving credit facility we may use the proceeds of any advances against the credit facility for general corporate purposes including future acquisitions and share repurchases 

this debt may adversely affect our financial condition and future financial results by among other things 

 our current revolving credit facility imposes restrictions on us including restrictions on our ability to create liens on our assets and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur indebtedness and require us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios our ability to comply with these ratios may be affected by events beyond our control in addition our short and longterm debt includes covenants that may adversely affect our ability to incur certain liens or engage in certain types of sale and leaseback transactions if we breach any of the covenants under our short and longterm debt or our revolving credit facility and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders then subject to applicable cure periods any outstanding indebtedness may be declared immediately due and payable

legal proceedings 

in fiscal 2015 intuit was contacted by regulatory authorities including congress the federal trade commission the sec the department of justice and certain state attorneys general which are conducting inquiries in connection with the increase during the 2015 tax season in attempts by criminals using stolen identity information to file fraudulent tax returns and claim refunds at the state and federal levels intuit is cooperating with all such government inquiries including formal requests for information in addition we are the subject of certain actions including a consolidated putative class action lawsuits by individuals who claim to have suffered damages in connection with the foregoing events we believe that the allegations contained within these lawsuits are without merit and we intend to vigorously defend against them 

intuit is subject to certain routine legal proceedings including class action lawsuits like those described above as well as demands claims government inquiries and threatened litigation that arise in the normal course of our business including assertions that we may be infringing patents or other intellectual property rights of others we currently believe that in addition to any amounts accrued the amount of potential losses if any for any pending claims of any type either alone or combined will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements the ultimate outcome of any litigation is uncertain and regardless of outcome litigation can have an adverse impact on intuit because of defense costs negative publicity diversion of management resources and other factors our failure to obtain necessary license or other rights or litigation arising out of intellectual property claims could adversely affect our business

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda includes the following sections 

 you should note that this mda discussion contains forwardlooking statements that involve risks and uncertainties please see the section entitled “forwardlooking statements and risk factors”  at the beginning of item 1a for important information to consider when evaluating such statements 

you should read this mda in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes in item 8 of this annual report in fiscal 2014 we acquired check inc we have included their results of operations in our consolidated results of operations from the date of acquisition 

in fiscal 2014 we completed the sales of our intuit financial services ifs and intuit health businesses in fiscal 2016 we completed the sales of our demandforce quickbase and quicken businesses we accounted for all of these businesses as discontinued operations and have therefore reclassified our statements of operations for all periods presented to reflect them as such we have also segregated the net assets of our demandforce quickbase and quicken businesses from continuing operations on our balance sheet at july 31 2015 because the cash flows of these discontinued operations were not material for any period presented we have not segregated them on our statements of cash flows see “results of operations – nonoperating income and expense – discontinued operations”  later in this item 7 for more information unless otherwise noted the following discussion pertains to our continuing operations 

executive overview 

this overview provides a high level discussion of our operating results and some of the trends that affect our business we believe that an understanding of these trends is important in order to understand our financial results for fiscal 2016  as well as our future prospects this summary is not intended to be exhaustive nor is it intended to be a substitute for the detailed discussion and analysis provided elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

industry trends and seasonality 

industry trends 

the industry in which we operate is dynamic and highly competitive and we expect it to remain so in the future the markets for software and related services especially highlyavailable connected services are characterized by rapid technological change shifting customer needs and frequent new product introductions and enhancements competitive interest and expertise 

 29 

tables of contents 

in many of the markets we serve have grown markedly over the past few years and we expect this trend to continue there are also large cloudbased service companies who innovate quickly and serve small businesses and consumers while today our competition with such companies may be limited as we and those companies grow our competition with them may increase in recent years the widespread availability of the internet the emergence of mobile devices and the explosion of social media have accelerated the pace of change and revolutionized the way that people throughout the world manage important financial tasks the result is a global market that is shifting from traditional services that are paperbased humanproduced and brickandmortar bound to one where people understand demand and embrace the benefits of connected services this trend toward connected services is the primary driver of the strategies in all of our businesses 

seasonality 

our consumer tax offerings have significant seasonal patterns as a result during each of the last three fiscal years the total revenue for our third quarter ended april 30 has represented nearly half of our total revenue for those years we expect the seasonality of our consumer tax business to continue to have a significant impact on our quarterly financial results in the future 

key challenges and risks 

our growth strategy depends upon our ability to initiate and embrace disruptive technology trends to enter new markets and to drive broad adoption of the products and services we develop and market our future growth also increasingly depends on the strength of our thirdparty business relationships and our ability to continue to develop maintain and strengthen new and existing relationships to remain competitive and continue to grow we are investing significant resources in our product development marketing and sales capabilities and we expect to continue to do so in the future 

as we continue transitioning to offer more connected services the ongoing operation and availability of our information technology and communication systems and those of our external service providers is becoming increasingly important because we help customers manage their financial lives we face risks associated with the hosting collection use and retention of personal customer information and data we are investing significant management attention and resources in our information technology infrastructure and in our privacy and security capabilities and we expect to continue to do so in the future 

beginning in early calendar year 2015 state taxing authorities the irs and the tax preparation industry experienced an increase in attempts by criminals using stolen identity information to file fraudulent tax returns and claim refunds at the federal level and expanding into the state level we implemented additional security measures in our products and began working with state governments to share information regarding suspicious filings while continuing to share such information with the federal government we continue to invest in security and to work with the broader industry and government to protect our customers against this type of fraud 

for a complete discussion of the most significant risks and uncertainties affecting our business please see “forwardlooking statements and risk factors”  in item 1a of this report 

overview of financial results 

the most important financial indicators that we use to assess our business are revenue growth for the company as a whole for each reportable segment and for product lines within each reportable segment operating income growth and operating income margins for the company as a whole and for each reportable segment earnings per share and cash flow from operations we also track certain nonfinancial drivers of revenue growth and when material identify them in the applicable discussions of segment results below these nonfinancial drivers include for example customer growth and retention for all of our businesses and transaction volume for our payment processing business total credit and debit card transaction volume correlates strongly with the macroeconomic environment and is one of the key drivers of revenue growth in our payment processing business customers for our connected services offerings have generally grown faster than those for our traditional desktop software offerings reflecting our strategic focus on connected services over the past few years connected services total service and other revenue generated 34  billion or 73  of our total revenue in fiscal 2016  compared with about 50 of our total revenue eight years ago we expect connected services revenue as a percentage of our total revenue to continue to grow in the future 

total net revenue for fiscal 2016  was 47 billion  an increase of 12  compared with fiscal 2015  total net revenue results were affected by changes we made to our desktop software offerings in fiscal 2015 starting with the release of quickbooks desktop 2015 in the first quarter of fiscal 2015 and for all subsequent versions we began delivering ongoing enhancements and certain connected services for our quickbooks desktop software products we plan to continue to provide ongoing enhancements and certain connected services for all future versions of these products as a result of these changes we recognize revenue for these quickbooks desktop software products as services are provided over approximately three years revenue in our small business segment increased 9  compared with fiscal 2015  due to growth in small business online ecosystem revenue and the impact of the changes to our quickbooks desktop software products the changes to our desktop software offerings also

affected our proconnect segment whose revenue increased 51  to 428  million in fiscal 2016 in fiscal 2015 we began delivering ongoing enhancements and certain connected services for our proconnect desktop software products and we plan to continue to provide them for all future versions of those products due to these changes we recognize revenue for these offerings as services are provided through the end of each calendar year prior to these changes we recognized a substantial portion of the revenue for these offerings during our third fiscal quarters ended april 30 revenue in our consumer tax segment increased 10  compared with fiscal 2015  due to 12 growth in us federal turbotax units 

operating income from continuing operations increased 68  in fiscal 2016  compared with fiscal 2015  due in part to the increase in revenue described above higher revenue was partially offset by higher costs and operating expenses including higher spending for staffing depreciation advertising and other marketing programs and sharebased compensation we also recorded goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges of 148  million to operating expense in fiscal 2015 

net income from continuing operations increased 95  in fiscal 2016  compared with fiscal 2015  due to the increase in operating income and a lower effective tax rate in fiscal 2016  diluted net income per share from continuing operations for fiscal 2016  increased 110  to 304  as a result of the increase in net income and the decline in weighted average diluted common shares compared with fiscal 2015 

we ended fiscal 2016  with cash cash equivalents and investments totaling 11 billion  in fiscal 2016  we generated cash from operations net sales of investments proceeds from our term loan the sales of our demandforce quickbase and quicken businesses and the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans during the same period we used cash for the repurchase of shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs the payment of cash dividends and capital expenditures including the purchase of certain previously leased facilities at july 31 2016  we had authorization from our board of directors to expend up to an additional 360 million for stock repurchases through may 19 2019 on august 19 2016 our board approved a new stock repurchase program under which we are authorized to repurchase up to an additional 2 billion of our common stock 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

in preparing our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap we are required to make estimates assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on our net revenue operating income or loss and net income or loss as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our balance sheet we believe that the estimates assumptions and judgments involved in the following accounting policies have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies 

 our senior management has reviewed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and their disclosure in this annual report on form 10k with the audit and risk committee of our board of directors 

revenue recognition 

we derive revenue from the sale of software subscriptions hosted services packaged software products financial supplies technical support plans transaction fees merchant services hardware and multiple element arrangements that may include a combination of these items we follow the appropriate revenue recognition rules for each type of revenue for additional information see “revenue recognition”  in note 1 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report we generally recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists we have delivered the product or performed the service the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable however determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves exercising judgment and using estimates that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report for example for multiple element arrangements containing only software and softwarerelated elements we must exercise judgment and use estimates in order to 1 allocate the total price among the various elements we must deliver 2 determine whether undelivered services are essential to the functionality of the delivered products and services 3 determine whether vendorspecific evidence of fair value exists for each undelivered element and 4 determine whether and when each element has been delivered for multiple element arrangements containing nonsoftware elements we must exercise judgment and use estimates in order to 1 determine whether and when each element has been delivered 2

tables of contents 

determine the fair value of each element using the selling price hierarchy of vendorspecific evidence of fair value vsoe if available thirdparty evidence tpe if vsoe is not available and estimated selling price esp if neither vsoe nor tpe is available and 3 allocate the total price among the various elements based on the relative selling price method if we were to change any of these judgments or estimates it could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period amounts for fees collected or invoiced and due relating to arrangements where revenue cannot be recognized are reflected on our balance sheet as deferred revenue and recognized when the applicable revenue recognition criteria are satisfied 

business combinations 

as described in “description of business and summary of significant accounting policies – business combinations”  in note 1 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report under the acquisition method of accounting we generally recognize the identifiable assets acquired the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interests in an acquiree at their fair values as of the date of acquisition we measure goodwill as the excess of consideration transferred which we also measure at fair value over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed the acquisition method of accounting requires us to exercise judgment and make significant estimates and assumptions regarding the fair values of the elements of a business combination as of the date of acquisition including the fair values of identifiable intangible assets deferred tax asset valuation allowances liabilities related to uncertain tax positions and contingencies this method also requires us to refine these estimates over a oneyear measurement period to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that if known would have affected the measurement of the amounts recognized as of that date if we are required to retroactively adjust provisional amounts that we have recorded for the fair values of assets and liabilities in connection with acquisitions these adjustments could materially decrease our operating income and net income and result in lower asset values on our balance sheet 

significant estimates and assumptions that we must make in estimating the fair value of acquired technology customer lists and other identifiable intangible assets include future cash flows that we expect to generate from the acquired assets if the subsequent actual results and updated projections of the underlying business activity change compared with the assumptions and projections used to develop these values we could record impairment charges in addition we have estimated the economic lives of certain acquired assets and these lives are used to calculate depreciation and amortization expense if our estimates of the economic lives change depreciation or amortization expenses could be accelerated or slowed 

goodwill acquired intangible assets and other longlived assets – impairment assessments 

we estimate the fair value of acquired intangible assets and other longlived assets that have finite useful lives whenever an event or change in circumstances indicates that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable we test for potential impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives annually in our fourth fiscal quarter or whenever indicators of impairment arise the timing of the annual test may result in charges to our statement of operations in our fourth fiscal quarter that could not have been reasonably foreseen in prior periods 

as described in “description of business and summary of significant accounting policies – goodwill acquired intangible assets and other longlived assets”  in note 1 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report in order to estimate the fair value of goodwill we use a weighted combination of a discounted cash flow model known as the income approach and comparisons to publicly traded companies engaged in similar businesses known as the market approach the income approach requires us to use a number of assumptions including market factors specific to the business the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows to be generated by the business over an extended period of time longterm growth rates for the business and a rate of return that considers the relative risk of achieving the cash flows and the time value of money we evaluate cash flows at the reporting unit level although the assumptions we use in our discounted cash flow model are consistent with the assumptions we use to generate our internal strategic plans and forecasts significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of future cash flows from each reporting unit and the relative risk of achieving those cash flows when using the market approach we make judgments about the comparability of publicly traded companies engaged in similar businesses we base our judgments on factors such as size growth rates profitability risk and return on investment we also make judgments when adjusting market multiples of revenue operating income and earnings for these companies to reflect their relative similarity to our own businesses we had a total of 13 billion  in goodwill on our balance sheet at july 31 2016  see note 5 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report for a summary of goodwill by reportable segment 

we estimate the recoverability of acquired intangible assets and other longlived assets that have finite useful lives by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows that we expect the asset to generate in order to estimate the fair value of those assets we estimate the present value of future cash flows from those assets the key assumptions that we use in our discounted cash flow model are the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows to be generated by the asset over an extended period of time and a rate of return that considers the relative risk of achieving the cash flows and the time value of money significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of future cash flows and 

 32 

tables of contents 

the relative risk of achieving those cash flows we also make judgments about the remaining useful lives of acquired intangible assets and other longlived assets that have finite lives we had a total of 44 million  in net acquired intangible assets on our balance sheet at july 31 2016  

assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives are complex and often subjective they can be affected by a variety of factors including external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts for example if our future operating results do not meet current forecasts or if we experience a sustained decline in our market capitalization that is determined to be indicative of a reduction in fair value of one or more of our reporting units we may be required to record future impairment charges for goodwill and acquired intangible assets impairment charges could materially decrease our future net income and result in lower asset values on our balance sheet 

during the fourth quarters of fiscal 2016  fiscal 2015  and fiscal 2014  we performed our annual goodwill impairment tests using the methodology described in “description of business and summary of significant accounting policies – goodwill acquired intangible assets and other longlived assets”  in note 1 to the financial statements in part 8 of this annual report we determined that the estimated fair values of all of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values and that they were not impaired in addition during this analysis we concluded that the estimated fair values of all of our reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying values 

during the third quarter of fiscal 2015 there was a significant decline in the revenue and operating income forecast for our consumer ecosystem reporting unit as a result of this development we performed an interim impairment test of goodwill and acquired intangible assets for that reporting unit we concluded that the carrying value of goodwill associated with our consumer ecosystem reporting unit was impaired and we recorded an impairment charge of 263  million that reduced the carrying value of goodwill to 211 million as of april 30 2015 see “ fair value measurements – assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis”  in note 2 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report for more information 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 management approved a plan to sell our quicken business which was part of our consumer ecosystem reporting unit and we accounted for it as discontinued operations as a result we reclassified a portion of the goodwill impairment charge that we recorded in the third quarter of fiscal 2015 to discontinued operations based on the relative fair values of quicken and the remaining components of our consumer ecosystem reporting unit in the third quarter of fiscal 2016 we completed the sale of our quicken business for cash consideration that was not significant 

accounting for sharebased compensation plans 

at july 31 2016  there was 585  million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested sharebased compensation arrangements granted under all equity compensation plans which we will amortize to expense in the future total unrecognized compensation cost will be adjusted for future changes in estimated forfeitures we expect to recognize that cost over a weighted average vesting period of 24  years 

we use a lattice binomial model and the assumptions described in note 11 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report to estimate the fair value of stock options granted we estimate the expected term of options granted based on implied exercise patterns using a binomial model we estimate the volatility of our common stock at the date of grant based on the implied volatility of publicly traded oneyear and twoyear options on our common stock our decision to use implied volatility is based upon the availability of actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility we base the riskfree interest rate that we use in our option valuation model on the implied yield in effect at the time of option grant on constant maturity us treasury issues with equivalent remaining terms we use an annualized expected dividend yield in our option valuation model we estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates we use historical data to estimate prevesting option forfeitures and record sharebased compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest we amortize the fair value of options on a straightline basis over the requisite service periods of the awards which are generally the vesting periods we may elect to use different assumptions under our option valuation model in the future which could materially affect our net income or loss and net income or loss per share 

restricted stock units rsus granted typically vest based on continued service we value these timebased rsus at the date of grant using the intrinsic value method adjusted for estimated forfeitures we amortize the fair value of timebased rsus on a straightline basis adjusted for estimated forfeitures over the service period certain rsus granted to senior management vest based on the achievement of preestablished performance or market goals we estimate the fair value of performancebased rsus at the date of grant using the intrinsic value method and the probability that the specified performance criteria will be met adjusted for estimated forfeitures each quarter we update our assessment of the probability that the specified performance criteria will be achieved and adjust our estimate of the fair value of the performancebased rsus if necessary we amortize the fair values of performancebased rsus over the requisite service period adjusted for estimated forfeitures for each separately

tables of contents 

vesting tranche of the award we estimate the fair value of marketbased rsus at the date of grant using a monte carlo valuation methodology and amortize those fair values over the requisite service period adjusted for estimated forfeitures for each separately vesting tranche of the award the monte carlo methodology that we use to estimate the fair value of marketbased rsus at the date of grant incorporates into the valuation the possibility that the market condition may not be satisfied provided that the requisite service is rendered the total fair value of the marketbased rsus at the date of grant must be recognized as compensation expense even if the market condition is not achieved however the number of shares that ultimately vest can vary significantly with the performance of the specified market criteria all of the rsus we grant have dividend rights that are subject to the same vesting requirements as the underlying equity awards so we do not adjust the intrinsic market value of our rsus for dividends see note 11 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report for more information 

legal contingencies 

we are subject to certain legal proceedings as well as demands claims and threatened litigation that arise in the normal course of our business we review the status of each significant matter quarterly and assess our potential financial exposure if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated we record a liability and an expense for the estimated loss if we determine that a loss is possible and the range of the loss can be reasonably determined then we disclose the range of the possible loss significant judgment is required in the determination of whether a potential loss is probable reasonably possible or remote as well as in the determination of whether a potential exposure is reasonably estimable our accruals are based on the best information available at the time as additional information becomes available we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates potential legal liabilities and the revision of estimates of potential legal liabilities could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 

accounting for income taxes – estimates of deferred taxes valuation allowances and uncertain tax positions 

we estimate our income taxes based on the various jurisdictions where we conduct business significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax rules and the potential for future adjustment of our uncertain tax positions by the united states internal revenue service or other taxing jurisdictions we estimate our current tax liability and assess temporary differences that result from differing treatments of certain items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which we show on our balance sheet we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized to the extent we believe that realization is not likely we establish a valuation allowance when we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in an accounting period we record a corresponding tax expense in our statement of operations 

at july 31 2016  we had net deferred tax assets of 132 million  which included a valuation allowance of 40 million  for loss and tax credit carryforwards related to state tax credits foreign losses and state capital and operating losses we recorded the valuation allowance to reflect uncertainties about whether we will be able to utilize some of our deferred tax assets before they expire while we believe our current valuation allowance is sufficient we could in the future be required to increase the valuation allowance to take into account additional deferred tax assets that we may be unable to realize we assess the need for an adjustment to the valuation allowance on a quarterly basis the assessment is based on our estimates of future sources of taxable income for the jurisdictions in which we operate and the periods over which our deferred tax assets will be realizable see note 10 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report for more information 

we recognize and measure benefits for uncertain tax positions using a twostep approach the first step is to evaluate the tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon audit including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes for tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely of being realized upon settlement significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions we evaluate our uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis our evaluations are based upon a number of factors including changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law correspondence with tax authorities during the course of audits and effective settlement of audit issues changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in material increases or decreases in our income tax expense in the period in which we make the change which could have a material impact on our effective tax rate and operating results

this segment targets professional accountants in the us and canada who are essential to both small business success and doing the nations’ taxes during fiscal 2017 we expect to expand our emphasis on the value that professional accountants bring to small businesses and focus less on growing our proconnect revenue through price increases we expect that this will result in slower proconnect revenue growth in fiscal 2017 than we have experienced historically

interest and other income expense net 



interest income in fiscal 2016  was lower compared with fiscal 2015  due to lower average interest rates and lower average invested balances higher average interest rates and stable average invested balances resulted in higher interest income in fiscal 2015  compared with fiscal 2014  in accordance with authoritative guidance we record gains and losses associated with executive deferred compensation plan assets in interest and other income and gains and losses associated with the related liabilities in operating expenses the total amounts recorded in operating expenses for each period are approximately equal to the total amounts recorded in interest and other income in those periods

net deferred tax assets 

at july 31 2016  we had net deferred tax assets of 132 million which included a valuation allowance of 40  million for loss and tax credit carryforwards related to state tax credits foreign losses and state capital and operating losses we recorded the valuation allowance to reflect uncertainties about whether we will be able to utilize some of our deferred tax assets before they expire while we believe our current valuation allowance is sufficient we could in the future be required to increase the valuation allowance to take into account additional deferred tax assets that we may be unable to realize we assess the need for an adjustment to the valuation allowance on a quarterly basis the assessment is based on our estimates of future sources of taxable income for the jurisdictions in which we operate and the periods over which our deferred tax assets will be realizable see “ critical accounting policies and estimates ” earlier in this item 7 and note 10 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report for more information

liquidity and capital resources 

overview 

at july 31 2016  our cash cash equivalents and investments totaled 11 billion  a decrease of 617  million from july 31 2015  due to the factors described in “statements of cash flows”  below our primary sources of liquidity have been cash from operations which entails the collection of accounts receivable for products and services and borrowings under our credit facilities our primary uses of cash have been for research and development programs selling and marketing activities capital projects acquisitions of businesses debt service costs repurchases of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs and the payment of cash dividends as discussed in “executive overview – industry trends and seasonality”  earlier in this item 7 our business is subject to significant seasonality the balance of our cash cash equivalents and investments generally fluctuates with that seasonal pattern we believe the seasonality of our business is likely to continue in the future 

the following table summarizes selected measures of our liquidity and capital resources at the dates indicated 



nm  not meaningful 

we have historically generated significant cash from operations and we expect to continue to do so during fiscal 2017  our cash cash equivalents and investments totaled 11 billion  at july 31 2016  none of those funds were restricted and approximately 82  of those funds were located in the us our unsecured revolving credit facility is available to us for general corporate purposes including future acquisitions and stock repurchases at july 31 2016  no amounts were outstanding under the revolving credit facility see note 8 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report for more information 

we evaluate on an ongoing basis the merits of acquiring technology or businesses or establishing strategic relationships with and investing in other companies our strong liquidity profile enables us to respond nimbly to these kinds of opportunities 

based on past performance and current expectations we believe that our cash and cash equivalents investments and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet anticipated seasonal working capital needs capital expenditure requirements contractual obligations commitments debt service requirements and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations for at least the next 12 months we expect to return excess cash generated by operations to our stockholders through repurchases of our common stock and payment of cash dividends after taking into account our operating and strategic cash needs

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

investment portfolio and interest rate risk 

we actively monitor market conditions and developments specific to the securities in which we invest we believe that we take a conservative approach to investing our funds in that we invest only in highlyrated securities and diversify our portfolio of investments while we believe we take prudent measures to mitigate investmentrelated risks such risks cannot be fully eliminated because of market circumstances that are outside our control 

our investments consist of instruments that meet quality standards that are consistent with our investment policy this policy specifies that except for direct obligations of the united states government securities issued by agencies of the united states government and money market funds we diversify our investments by limiting our holdings with any individual issuer we do not hold derivative financial instruments or european sovereign debt in our portfolio of investments see note 2 and note 3 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report for a summary of the amortized cost and fair value of our investments by type of issue

tables of contents 

our cash equivalents and investments are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates interest rate movements affect the interest income we earn on cash equivalents and investments and the value of those investments at july 31 2016 our cash equivalents and investments totaled 11 billion  and had a weighted average pretax yield of 094  total interest income for fiscal 2016 was 3 million  if the federal reserve target rate had increased by 25 basis points from the level of july 31 2016  the value of our investments at that date would have decreased by approximately 2  million if the federal reserve target rate had increased by 100 basis points from the level of july 31 2016  the value of our investments at that date would have decreased by approximately 7 million 

we are also exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates as they affect our 1 billion unsecured revolving credit facility and 500 million unsecured term loan advances under the revolving credit facility accrue interest at rates that are equal to bank of america’s alternate base rate plus a margin that ranges from 00  to 05  or the london interbank offered rate libor plus a margin that ranges from 09  to 15  the term loan accrues interest at rates that are equal to at our election either bank of americas alternate base rate plus a margin that ranges from 0125 to 0875 or libor plus a margin that ranges from 1125 to 1875 actual margins under all of these elections are based on our senior debt credit ratings consequently our interest expense fluctuates with changes in the general level of these interest rates at july 31 2016  no amounts were outstanding under the revolving credit facility and 500 million was outstanding under the term loan 

on march 12 2007 we issued 500 million of 575 senior unsecured notes due on march 15 2017 we carry these senior notes at face value less unamortized discount on our balance sheets since these senior notes bear interest at fixed rates we have no financial statement risk associated with changes in interest rates however the fair value of these notes fluctuates when interest rates change see note 2 and note 8 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report for more information 

impact of foreign currency rate changes 

the functional currencies of our international operating subsidiaries are generally the local currencies we translate the assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries at the exchange rates in effect on the balance sheet date we translate their revenue costs and expenses at the average rates of exchange in effect during the period we include translation gains and losses in the stockholders’ equity section of our balance sheets we include net gains and losses resulting from foreign exchange transactions in interest and other income in our statements of operations 

since we translate foreign currencies primarily canadian dollars indian rupees and british pounds into us dollars for financial reporting purposes currency fluctuations can have an impact on our financial results the historical impact of currency fluctuations has generally been immaterial we believe that our exposure to currency exchange fluctuation risk is not significant primarily because our global subsidiaries invoice customers and satisfy their financial obligations almost exclusively in their local currencies although the impact of currency fluctuations on our financial results has generally been immaterial in the past and we believe that for the reasons cited above currency fluctuations will not be significant in the future the impact of currency fluctuations could be material in the future as of july 31 2016  we did not engage in foreign currency hedging activities

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

during our most recent fiscal quarter there has not occurred any change in our internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls 

our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer believes that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and that they are effective at the reasonable assurance level however no matter how well conceived and executed a control system can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met the design of any control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs there are also limitations that are inherent in any control system these limitations include the realities that breakdowns can occur because of errors in judgment or mistakes and that controls can be circumvented by individual persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls because of these inherent limitations in a cost effective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected

tables of contents 

our growth strategy is described below and focuses on two key outcomes 

 we apply this vision globally helping our customers expand their business to domestic and global markets creating and selling our own products internationally and extending our recruiting efforts to new countries to find bestinclass talent 

our business portfolio 

we organize our businesses into three  reportable segments – small business consumer tax and professional tax

consumer tax  this segment targets consumers and includes turbotax income tax preparation products and services

recent developments   in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 management approved a divestiture plan and an organizational realignment to increase our focus on the two strategic outcomes described in “intuit’s mission”  above the divestiture plan included our demandforce and quickbase businesses which were part of the small business segment and our quicken business which was part of the consumer ecosystem product line in the former consumer segment as a result we classified these three businesses as discontinued operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 and have not included them in the description of our portfolio of businesses above the remaining components of the consumer ecosystem product line are now included in the small business segment and the former consumer segment is now called the consumer tax segment 

our growth strategy 

based on our assessment of key technology and demographic trends – an increasingly borderless world the prevalence of mobile devices and the scalability of the cloud – we see significant opportunities to drive future growth by continuing to solve the unmet needs of consumers small businesses and accounting professionals our evolving growth strategy includes three key elements 

 

 

 this strategy recognizes the emergence and influence of the digital generation the increasing relevance of social networks and customers’ growing reliance on the internet mobile devices and informationbased technology to manage important financial tasks it also acknowledges the potential of new market opportunities around the world the result is a global market that is shifting from traditional services that are paperbased humanproduced and brickandmortar bound to one where people understand demand and embrace the benefits of connected services 

we continue to make significant progress in this environment connected services total service and other revenue generated 30 billion or 73 percent of our total revenue in fiscal 2015  compared with about 50 percent of our total revenue seven years ago

product development 

since the markets for software and related services are characterized by rapid technological change shifting customer needs and frequent new product introductions and enhancements a continuous high level of investment is required to innovate and quickly develop new products and services as well as enhance existing offerings our product development efforts are becoming more important than ever as we pursue our connected services strategy which reflects a world where people and businesses are increasingly connected by technology and expect access to services at any time in any place 

we develop many of our products and services internally we have a number of united states and foreign patents and pending applications that relate to various aspects of our products and technology we supplement our internal development efforts by acquiring or licensing products and technology from third parties and establishing other relationships that enable us to enhance or expand our offerings more rapidly we expect to expand our third party technology relationships as we continue to pursue our connected services strategy 

our traditional desktop software products – quickbooks turbotax lacerte and proseries – tend to have predictable annual development and product release cycles we also develop innovative new offerings including mobile applications for which development cycles are often more rapid developing consumer and professional tax software and services presents unique challenges because of the demanding development cycle required to accurately incorporate federal and state tax law and tax form changes within a rigid timetable the development timing for our small business payroll and merchant payment processing services offerings varies with business needs and regulatory requirements and the length of the development cycle depends on the scope and complexity of each project 

we continue to make substantial investments in research and development and we expect to focus our future research and development efforts on enhancing existing products and services and on developing new products and services including new mobile and global offerings we also expect to continue to focus significant research and development efforts on ongoing projects to update the technology platforms for several of our offerings our research and development expenses were 798  million or 19  of total net revenue in fiscal 2015  714 million or 17  of total net revenue in fiscal 2014  and 647 million or 17  of total net revenue in fiscal 2013  

seasonality 

our consumer tax professional tax and quickbooks offerings have significant and distinct seasonal patterns as a result our total net revenue is usually highest during our second quarter ending january 31 and third quarter ending april 30 we typically report losses in our first quarter ending october 31 and fourth quarter ending july 31 when our total net revenue is lower but core operating expenses such as research and development continue at relatively consistent levels although the seasonal patterns for all three of our reporting segments continue to evolve as described below we expect the overall seasonality of our business to continue to have a significant impact on our quarterly financial results in the future 

our consumer tax and professional tax offerings are highly seasonal sales of income tax preparation products and services are heavily concentrated from november through april in addition an increasing proportion of our consumer tax revenue has been shifting to later in this seasonal period and we expect that trend to continue in the future this is due in part to the growth in sales of turbotax online for which we recognize revenue toward the end of the tax preparation process when tax returns are printed or electronically filed the seasonality of our consumer tax and professional tax revenue is also affected by the timing of the availability of tax forms from taxing agencies and the ability of those agencies to receive electronic tax return submissions delays in the availability of tax forms or the ability of taxing agencies to receive submissions can cause consumer tax and professional tax revenue to shift between our fiscal quarters in fiscal 2015 we began delivering ongoing enhancements and certain connected services for our professional tax desktop software offerings as a result of this change we recognize revenue for these offerings as services are provided through the end of each calendar year 

in our small business segment prior to fiscal 2015 we launched annual releases of our quickbooks desktop software products each fall and revenue for those products tended to be highest around calendar year end during our second and third fiscal quarters starting with quickbooks 2015 which was released in the first quarter of fiscal 2015 we began delivering ongoing enhancements and certain connected services for our quickbooks desktop software products as a result of this change we recognize revenue for these quickbooks desktop products as services are provided over approximately three years customers are also increasingly choosing the online and subscription versions of our quickbooks offerings for which we recognize revenue as the services are provided customer acquisition for these offerings tends to be highest around calendar year end during our second and third fiscal quarters for these reasons the seasonality of our small business segment revenue has started to become less pronounced and we expect that trend to continue in the future

competition 

overview 

we face intense competition in all of our businesses both domestically and internationally competitive interest and expertise in many of the markets we serve have grown markedly over the past few years and we expect this trend to continue some of our existing competitors have significantly greater financial technical and marketing resources than we do in addition the competitive landscape can shift rapidly as new companies enter markets in which we compete this is particularly true for online and mobile products and services where the barriers to entry are lower than they are for desktop software products and services to attract customers many online and mobile competitors are offering free or lowpriced entrylevel products which we must take into account in our pricing strategies 

our most obvious competition comes from other companies that offer technology solutions similar to ours however for many of our products and services other important competitive alternatives for customers are third party service providers such as professional accountants and seasonal assisted tax preparation businesses manual tools and processes or generalpurpose software are also important competitive alternatives 

competition specific to segments 

small business segment  our quickbooks desktop product is the leading small business financial management software in the us retail channel our small business products and services face competitive challenges from companies such as the sage group plc which offers software and associated services that directly target small business customers increasingly our small business products and services also face competition from newer online accounting offerings from companies such as xero free or lowcost online accounting offerings and free online banking and bill payment services offered by financial institutions and others in our payroll business we compete directly with automatic data processing inc adp paychex and many other companies with payroll offerings including online payroll offerings in our merchant services business we compete directly with large financial institutions such as wells fargo jp morgan chase and bank of america and with many payment processors including first data corporation elavon global payments fiscertegy paypal and square 

consumer tax segment  in our consumer tax segment our future growth depends on our ability to attract new customers to the selfpreparation tax category from tax stores and other tax preparers in the us private sector we face intense competition from hr block which provides tax preparation services in its stores and a competing software offering called hr block at home we also face competition from several other large tax preparation service providers from a myriad of small tax preparers and from numerous online selfpreparation offerings including blucora’s taxact in canada our turbotax canada offerings face competition from hr block simpletax studiotax and ufile these competing offerings subject us to significant price pressure in both the us and canada 

we also face competitive challenges from publicly funded government entities that offer electronic tax preparation and filing services at no cost to individual taxpayers we are a member of the free file alliance a consortium of private sector companies that has entered into an agreement with the federal government under this agreement the member companies provide online federal tax preparation and filing services at no cost to eligible federal taxpayers and the federal government has agreed not to provide a competing service approximately 22 states have also adopted free file alliance publicprivate agreements while approximately 20 other states offer some form of direct government tax preparation and filing services free to qualified taxpayers we continue to actively work with others in the private and public sectors to advance the goals of the free file alliance policy initiative and to support successful publicprivate partnerships however future administrative regulatory or legislative activity in this area could harm our consumer tax business 

professional tax segment  in the us lacerte professional tax offerings face competition from competitivelypriced tax and accounting solutions that include integration with nontax functionality these include cch’s prosystems fx office suite and thomson reuters’ cs professional suite and gosystems tax our proseries professional tax offerings face competition from cch’s atx and taxwise offerings drake and other smaller providers in canada our profile professional tax offerings face competition from cch’s cantax and taxprep offerings and from thomson reuters’ dtmax and ufile pro offerings we also face growing competition from online tax and accounting offerings which may be marketed more effectively or have lower pricing than our offerings for accounting professionals

competitive factors 

we believe the most important competitive factors for our core offerings – quickbooks turbotax lacerte and proseries – are ease of use product features size of the installed customer base brand name recognition value proposition cost reliability and product and support quality access to distribution channels is also important for our quickbooks and turbotax software products in addition support from accounting professionals and the ability for customers to upgrade within product families as their businesses grow are significant competitive factors for our quickbooks products productivity is an important competitive factor for the fullservice accounting firms to which we market our lacerte software products we believe we compete effectively on these factors as our quickbooks and turbotax products are the leading products in the us for their respective categories 

for our service offerings such as small business payroll and merchant payment processing we believe the most important competitive factors are functionality ease of use high availability the integration of these products with related software brand name recognition effective distribution quality of support and cost 

customer service and technical support 

we provide customer service and technical support by telephone email online chat text messaging online communities and our customer service and technical support websites we have fulltime and outsourced customer service and technical support staffs we supplement these staffs with seasonal employees and additional outsourcing during periods of peak call volumes such as during the tax return filing season or following a major product launch we outsource to several firms domestically and internationally most of our internationally outsourced consumer and small business customer service and technical support personnel are currently located in india and the philippines 

we offer free selfhelp information through our technical support websites for our quickbooks turbotax and professional tax software products customers can also use our websites to find answers to commonly asked questions and check on the status of orders under certain paid support plans customers can also use our websites to receive product updates electronically support alternatives and fees vary by product we sponsor online user communities such as intuit community for small businesses and accounting professionals and turbotax answer exchange where consumers can share knowledge and product advice with each other we also offer live tax advice from usbased tax professionals to turbotax users 

manufacturing and distribution 

online products and services 

intuit’s data centers house most of the systems networks and databases required to operate and deliver our online products and services these include quickbooks online online payroll services merchant payment processing services turbotax online intuit tax online and consumer and professional electronic tax filing services through our data centers we connect customers to our products and services and store customer and business information as our businesses continue to move toward delivering more online and mobile products and services in conjunction with our connected services strategy we expect that our infrastructure will become even more critical to our business in the future 

our primary data centers are a facility we own in washington state and a colocated data center in nevada we also have a number of other data centers that are primarily located in the western united states and canada we continue to execute on a multiyear plan to transition to fewer data centers in more geographically diverse locations in addition we have an enterprise agreement with amazon web services and over time will be hosting an increasing number of our applications and services in their secure online environment 

desktop software and supplies 

although an increasing proportion of our desktop software customers choose to electronically download software many customers continue to choose to purchase these products in the form of physical media the key processes in manufacturing desktop software are manufacturing compact discs cds and digital video discs dvds printing boxes and related materials and assembling and shipping the final products 

for retail manufacturing we have an agreement with arvato digital services inc a division of bertelsmann ag under which arvato provides a majority of the manufacturing volume for our launches of quickbooks and turbotax as well as for daytoday replenishment after product launches arvato has operations in multiple locations that can provide redundancy if necessary we also have an agreement with cinram corp under which cinram provides outsourced manufacturing volume for these launches and for daytoday replenishment 

for retail distribution we have an agreement with arvato under which arvato handles all logistics services our retail product launches are operationally complex our model for product delivery for retail launches and replenishment is a hybrid of direct to store deliveries and shipments to central warehouse locations this allows improved inventory management by our retailers we also ship products for many of our smaller retail customers through distributors

arvato also provides most of the manufacturing volume and distribution services for our direct desktop software orders we have an exclusive agreement with harland clarke a division of mf worldwide corporation to fulfill orders for all of our printed checks and most other products for our financial supplies business 

we have multiple sources for all of our raw materials and availability has historically not been a significant problem for us we continue to see consolidation among cddvd suppliers and reduced demand overall for this media type as a result we believe cddvd media may become more difficult to obtain in the next three to five years 

backlog is minimal and we typically ship products within a few days of receiving an order 

privacy and security of customer information and transactions 

we are subject to various federal state and international laws and regulations and to financial institution and healthcare provider requirements relating to the privacy and security of customer and employee personal information we are also subject to laws and regulations that apply to the internet behavioral tracking and advertising mobile applications and messaging telemarketing email activities data hosting and retention financial and health information and credit reporting additional laws in all of these areas are likely to be passed in the future which could result in significant limitations on or changes to the ways in which we can collect use host store or transmit the personal information and data of our customers or employees communicate with our customers and deliver products and services or may significantly increase our compliance costs as our business expands to new industry segments and new uses of data that are regulated for privacy and security or to countries outside the united states that have strict data protections laws our compliance requirements and costs will increase 

through a master privacy policy framework designed to be consistent with globally recognized privacy principles we comply with united states federal and other country guidelines and practices to help ensure that customers and employees are aware of and can control how we use information about them our primary websites and online products such as intuitcom quickbooks and turbotax have been certified by truste an independent organization that operates a website and online product privacy certification program representing industry standard practices to address users’ and regulators’ concerns about online privacy we also use privacy statements to provide notice to customers of our privacy practices as well as provide them the opportunity to furnish instructions with respect to use of their personal information we participate in industry groups whose purpose is to develop or shape industry best practices and to influence public policy for privacy and security 

to address security concerns we use security safeguards to help protect the systems and the information customers give to us from loss misuse and unauthorized alteration whenever customers transmit sensitive information such as credit card information or tax return data through one of our websites or products we use industry standards to encrypt the data as it is transmitted to us we work to protect our systems from unauthorized internal or external access using numerous commercially available computer security products as well as internally developed security procedures and practices 

government regulation 

our consumer tax and professional tax segments are subject to federal and state government requirements including regulations related to the electronic filing of tax returns the provision of tax preparer assistance and the use and disclosure of customer information in addition we offer certain other products and services to small businesses and consumers such as payroll payments and financing which are also subject to regulatory requirements as we expand our products and services both domestically and internationally we may become subject to additional government regulation further regulators may adopt new laws or regulations or their interpretation of existing laws or regulations may differ from ours or expand to cover additional products and services these increased regulatory requirements could impose significant limitations on our business and increase our cost of compliance 

we are subject to federal and state laws and government regulations concerning employee safety and health and environmental matters the occupational safety and health administration the environmental protection agency and other federal and state agencies have the authority to put regulations in place that may have an impact on our operations

intellectual property 

our success depends on the proprietary technology embodied in our offerings we protect this proprietary technology by relying on a variety of intellectual property mechanisms including copyright patent trade secret and trademark laws restrictions on disclosure and other methods for example we regularly file applications for patents copyrights and trademarks and service marks in order to protect intellectual property that we believe is important to our business we hold a growing patent portfolio that we believe is important to intuit’s overall competitive advantage although we are not materially dependent on any one patent or particular group of patents in our portfolio at this time we also have a number of registered trademarks that include intuit quickbooks turbotax lacerte proseries and mint we have registered these and other trademarks and service marks in the united states and depending on the relevance of each brand to other markets in many foreign countries most registrations can be renewed perpetually at 10year intervals we also license intellectual property from third parties for use in our products 

although our portfolio of patents is growing the patents that have been issued to us could be determined to be invalid and may not be enforceable against competitive products in every jurisdiction in addition third parties have asserted and may in the future assert infringement claims against us and our customers these claims and any litigation may result in invalidation of our proprietary rights or a finding of infringement along with an assessment of damages litigation even if without merit could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention in addition third party licenses may not continue to be available to us on commercially acceptable terms or at all 

employees 

as of july 31 2015  we had approximately 7700  fulltime employees in major offices in the united states canada india the united kingdom and other locations we also employ a significant number of seasonal and contract employees during the second and third quarters of our fiscal years to support our consumer tax customers for example at the peak of the 2014  tax season we employed approximately 985 seasonal employees we believe our future success and growth will depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees in all areas of our business we do not currently have any collective bargaining agreements with our employees and we believe employee relations are generally good although we have employmentrelated agreements with a number of key employees these agreements do not guarantee continued service we believe we offer competitive compensation and a good working environment we were named one of fortune  magazine’s “100 best companies to work for” in each of the last fourteen years however we face intense competition for qualified employees and we expect to face continuing challenges in recruiting and retention

forwardlooking statements and risk factors 

this annual report on form 10k contains forwardlooking statements all statements in this report other than statements that are purely historical are forwardlooking statements words such as “expect” “anticipate” “intend” “plan” “believe” “forecast” “estimate” “seek” and similar expressions also identify forwardlooking statements in this report forwardlooking statements include without limitation the following

tables of contents 

 we caution investors that forwardlooking statements are only predictions based on our current expectations about future events and are not guarantees of future performance we encourage you to read carefully all information provided in this report and in our other filings with the sec before deciding to invest in our stock or to maintain or change your investment these forwardlooking statements are based on information as of the filing date of this annual report and we undertake no obligation to revise or update any forwardlooking statement for any reason 

because forwardlooking statements involve risks and uncertainties there are important factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forwardlooking statements these factors include the following 

we face intense competitive pressures that may harm our operating results 

we face intense competition in all of our businesses and we expect competition to remain intense in the future our competitors and potential competitors range from large and established entities to emerging startups our competitors may introduce superior products and services reduce prices have greater technical marketing and other resources have greater name recognition have larger installed bases of customers have wellestablished relationships with our current and potential customers advertise aggressively or beat us to market with new products and services in addition we may face competition from existing companies with large established consumer userbases and broadbased platforms who may change or expand the focus of their business strategies and marketing to target our customers including small businesses and tax customers we also face intensified competition from providers of free accounting tax payments and other financial services in order to compete we have also introduced free offerings in several categories but we may not be able to attract customers or effectively monetize all of these offerings and customers who have formerly paid for intuit’s products and services may elect to use free offerings instead these competitive factors may diminish our revenue and profitability and harm our ability to acquire and retain customers 

our consumer tax business also faces significant competition from the public sector where we face the risk of federal and state taxing authorities developing software or other systems to facilitate tax return preparation and electronic filing at no charge to taxpayers these or similar programs may be introduced or expanded in the future which may cause us to lose customers and revenue although the free file alliance has kept the federal government from being a direct competitor to intuit’s tax offerings it has fostered additional online competition and may cause us to lose significant revenue opportunities the current agreement with the free file alliance is scheduled to expire in october 2020 we anticipate that governmental encroachment at both the federal and state levels may present a continued competitive threat to our business for the foreseeable future 

future revenue growth depends upon our ability to adapt to technological change and successfully introduce new and enhanced products services and business models 

the software as a service desktop software and mobile technology industries are characterized by rapidly changing technology evolving industry standards and frequent new product introductions as we continue to grow our software as a service mobile and other offerings we must continue to innovate and develop new products and features to meet changing customer needs and attract and retain talented software developers we need to continue to develop our skills tools and capabilities to capitalize on existing and emerging technologies which require us to devote significant resources 

a number of our businesses also derive a significant amount of their sales from onetime upfront license fees and rely on customer upgrades and service offerings to generate a significant portion of their revenues in addition our consumer and professional tax businesses depend significantly on revenue from customers who return each year to use our updated tax preparation and filing software and services as our existing products mature encouraging customers to purchase product upgrades becomes more challenging unless new product releases provide features and functionality that have meaningful incremental value if we are not able to develop and clearly demonstrate the value of new or upgraded products or services to our customers our revenues may be harmed in addition as we continue to introduce and expand our new business models including offerings that are subscriptionbased or that are free to end users we may be unsuccessful in monetizing or increasing customer adoption of these offerings 

the number of people who access products and services through devices other than personal computers including mobile phones smartphones and handheld computers such as tablets continues to increase we have devoted significant resources to 

 14 

tables of contents 

develop products and services for users of these alternative devices but the versions of our products and services developed for these devices may not be compelling to users even if we are able to attract new users through these mobile offerings the amount of revenue that we derive per user from mobile offerings may be less than the revenue that we have historically derived from users of personal computers as new devices and new platforms are continually being released it is difficult to predict the problems we may encounter in developing versions of our products and services for use on these alternative devices and we may need to devote significant resources to the creation support and maintenance of such offerings if we are slow to develop products and technologies that are compatible with these alternative devices or if our competitors are able to achieve those results more quickly than us we will fail to capture a significant share of an increasingly important portion of the market for online services which could adversely affect our business 

in some cases we may expend a significant amount of resources and management attention on offerings that do not ultimately succeed in their markets we have encountered difficulty in launching new products and services in the past if we misjudge customer needs in the future our new products and services may not succeed and our revenues and earnings may be harmed we have also invested and in the future expect to invest in new business models geographies strategies and initiatives such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties including distraction of management from current operations expenses associated with the initiatives and inadequate return on investments because these new initiatives are inherently risky they may not be successful and may harm our financial condition and operating results 

business interruption or failure of our information technology and communication systems may impair the availability of our products and services which may damage our reputation and harm our future financial results 

as we continue to transition our business to more connected services we become more dependent on the continuing operation and availability of our information technology and communication systems and those of our external service providers including for example third party internetbased or “cloud” computing services we do not have redundancy for all of our systems many of our critical applications reside in only one of our data centers and our disaster recovery planning may not account for all eventualities in the event of significant system disruption we may experience loss of data or processing capabilities which may cause us to lose customers and may materially harm our reputation and our operating results in addition we are in the process of updating our customer facing applications and the supporting information technology infrastructure to meet our customers’ expectations for continuous service availability any difficulties in upgrading these applications or infrastructure or failure of our systems or those of our thirdparty service providers may result in interruptions in our service which may reduce our revenues and profits cause us to lose customers and damage our reputation any prolonged interruptions at any time may result in lost customers additional refunds of customer charges negative publicity and increased operating costs any of which may significantly harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are in the process of migrating our applications and infrastructure to new data centers and to third party hosted environments if we do not execute the transition to these new environments in an effective manner we may experience unplanned service disruptions or unforeseen increases in costs which may harm our operating results and our business 

our business operations data centers information technology and communications systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters human error malicious attacks fire power loss telecommunications failures computer viruses computer denial of service attacks terrorist attacks and other events beyond our control the majority of our activities our corporate headquarters our principal information technology systems and other critical business operations are located near major seismic faults we do not carry earthquake insurance for direct quakerelated losses our future financial results may be materially harmed in the event of a major earthquake or other natural or manmade disaster 

we rely on internal systems and external systems maintained by manufacturers distributors and other service providers to take and fulfill customer orders handle customer service requests and host certain online activities any interruption or failure of our internal or external systems may prevent us or our service providers from accepting and fulfilling customer orders or cause company and customer data to be unintentionally disclosed our continuing efforts to upgrade and expand our network security and other information systems as well as our highavailability capabilities may be costly and problems with the design or implementation of system enhancements may harm our business and our results of operations 

we host collect use and retain sensitive and personal customer information and data a security breach resulting in third party access to this information and data could materially disrupt our businesses result in the disclosure of confidential information significantly damage our reputation and cause material losses 

we host collect use and retain large amounts of sensitive and personal customer information and data including credit card information tax return information bank account numbers and passwords personal and business financial data and transactions social security numbers healthcare information and payroll information in addition we collect and maintain 

 15 

tables of contents 

sensitive and personal information of our employees in the ordinary course of our business the volume of sensitive and personal information that we collect has been increasing and will continue to increase as we further transition our businesses to connected services we and our vendors use commercially available security technologies to protect this information and data and we also use security and business controls to limit access to and use of such sensitive and personal customer information and data however such measures cannot provide absolute security and we have experienced instances in the past 

where criminals using stolen identity information obtained outside of our systems have gained unauthorized and illegal access 

to our customers’ data as the accessibility of stolen identity information increases we may experience additional instances of unauthorized and illegal access to our systems using our customers’ stolen identity information in the future in addition third parties may fraudulently induce employees customers or users to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data or customers’ data the security measures that we implement may not be able to prevent access to our systems from unauthorized users who have fraudulently obtained our customers’ personal information in addition because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access change frequently and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventive measures a major breach of our security measures or those of third parties that provide hosting services or have access to our sensitive and personal customer information may have serious negative consequences for our businesses including possible fines penalties and damages reduced customer demand for our services material harm to our reputation and brands further regulation and oversight by federal or state agencies and loss of our ability to provide financial transaction services or accept and process customer credit card orders or tax returns 

from time to time we detect or receive notices from customers or public or private agencies that they have detected vulnerabilities in our servers our software or thirdparty software components that are distributed with our products or fraudulent activity by unauthorized persons utilizing our products with stolen customer identity information the existence of such vulnerabilities or fraudulent activity even if they do not result in a security breach may undermine customer confidence as well as the confidence of government agencies that we rely on to ensure that we can implement our offerings and require substantial resources to address and we may not be able to discover or remediate such security vulnerabilities before they are exploited in addition our technologies systems and networks and our customers’ devices have been subject to and are likely to continue to be the target of cyber attacks computer viruses worms phishing attacks malicious software programs and other information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release gathering monitoring misuse loss or destruction of our customers’ sensitive and personal information and data or otherwise disrupt our or our customers’ or other third parties’ business operations although this is an industrywide problem that affects software across platforms it is increasingly affecting our offerings because cybercriminals tend to focus their efforts on wellknown offerings that are popular among customers and we expect them to continue to do so if these cybercriminals are able to circumvent our security measures or if we are unable to detect an intrusion into our systems and contain such intrusion in a reasonable amount of time our customers’ sensitive and personal information and data may be compromised 

in addition our employees contractors temporary and seasonal employees may have access to sensitive and personal information of our customers and employees while we conduct background checks of our employees and these other individuals and limit access to systems and data it is possible that one or more of these individuals may circumvent these controls resulting in a security breach in addition we rely on third party vendors to host certain of our sensitive and personal information and data while we conduct due diligence on these third party partners with respect to their security and business controls we may not have the ability to effectively monitor or oversee the implementation of these controls measures and in any event individuals or third parties may be able to circumvent andor exploit vulnerabilities that may exist in these security and business controls resulting in a loss of sensitive and personal customer or employee information and data 

if we are unable to develop manage and maintain critical third party business relationships our business may be adversely affected 

our growth is dependent on the strength of our business relationships and our ability to continue to develop maintain and leverage new and existing relationships we rely on various third party partners including software and service providers suppliers vendors manufacturers distributors contractors financial institutions core processors licensing partners and development partners among others in many areas of our business in order to deliver our offerings and operate our business we also rely on third parties to support the operation of our business by maintaining our physical facilities equipment power systems and infrastructure in certain instances these third party relationships are sole source or limited source relationships and can be difficult to replace or substitute depending on the level of integration of the third party’s products or services into or with our offerings andor the general availability of such third party’s products and services in addition there may be few or no alternative third party providers or vendors in the market further there can be no assurance that we will be able to adequately retain third party contractors engaged to help us operate our business the failure of third parties to provide acceptable and high quality products services and technologies or to update their products services and technologies may result in a disruption to our business operations and our customers which may reduce our revenues and profits cause us to lose

customers and damage our reputation alternative arrangements and services may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or we may experience business interruptions upon a transition to an alternative partner 

in particular we have relationships with banks credit unions and other financial institutions that support certain critical services we offer to our customers if macroeconomic conditions or other factors cause any of these institutions to fail consolidate stop providing certain services or institute costcutting efforts our business and financial results may suffer and we may be unable to offer those services to our customers 

we have also started to increasingly utilize the distribution platforms of third parties like apple’s app store and google’s play store for the distribution of certain of our product offerings although we benefit from the strong brand recognition and large user base of these distribution platforms to attract new customers the platform owners have wide discretion to change the pricing structure terms of service and other policies with respect to us and other developers any adverse changes by these third parties could adversely affect our financial results     

increased government regulation of our businesses may harm our operating results 

the company is subject to federal state and local laws and regulations that affect the company’s activities including without limitation areas of labor advertising tax financial services data privacy and security requirements digital content consumer protection real estate billing ecommerce promotions quality of services intellectual property ownership and infringement import and export requirements anticorruption foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions anticompetition environmental health and safety there have been significant new regulations and heightened focus by the government on many of these areas as well as in areas such as insurance and healthcare including for example the affordable care act a s we expand our products and services and revise our business models both domestically and internationally we may become subject to additional government regulation or increased regulatory scrutiny further regulators may adopt new laws or regulations or their interpretation of existing laws or regulations may differ from ours as well as the laws of other jurisdictions in which we operate these regulatory requirements could impose significant limitations require changes to our business require notification to customers or employees of a security breach restrict our use of personal information or cause changes in customer purchasing behavior which may make our business more costly less efficient or impossible to conduct and may require us to modify our current or future products or services which may harm our future financial results for example as our business continues to expand to new industry segments that may be more highly regulated for privacy and data security and to countries outside the united states that have more strict data protection laws our compliance requirements and costs may increase we have incurred – and may continue to incur – significant expenses to comply with mandatory privacy and security standards and protocols imposed by law regulation industry standards or contractual obligations 

the tax preparation industry continues to receive heightened attention from federal and state governments new legislation regulation public policy considerations changes in the cybersecurity environment litigation by the government or private entities or new interpretations of existing laws may result in greater oversight of the tax preparation industry restrict the types of products and services that we can offer or the prices we can charge or otherwise cause us to change the way we operate our tax businesses or offer our tax products and services we may not be able to respond quickly to such regulatory legislative and other developments and these changes may in turn increase our cost of doing business and limit our revenue opportunities in addition if our practices are not consistent with new interpretations of existing laws we may become subject to lawsuits penalties and other liabilities that did not previously apply we are also required to comply with a variety of state revenue agency standards in order to successfully operate our tax preparation and electronic filing services changes in stateimposed requirements by one or more of the states including the required use of specific technologies or technology standards may significantly increase the costs of providing those services to our customers and may prevent us from delivering a quality product to our customers in a timely manner 

if we fail to process transactions effectively or fail to adequately protect against disputed or potential fraudulent activities our revenue and earnings may be harmed 

our operations process a significant volume and dollar value of transactions on a daily basis especially in our payroll and payments businesses due to the size and volume of transactions that we handle effective processing systems and controls are essential to ensure that transactions are handled appropriately despite our efforts it is possible that we may make errors or that funds may be misappropriated due to fraud the systems supporting our business are comprised of multiple technology platforms that are difficult to scale if we are unable to effectively manage our systems and processes we may be unable to process customer data in an accurate reliable and timely manner which may harm our business in our payments processing service business if merchants for whom we process payment transactions are unable to pay refunds due to their customers in connection with disputed or fraudulent merchant transactions we may be required to pay those amounts and our payments may exceed the amount of the customer reserves we have established to make such payments

if we are unable to effectively combat the increasing amount and sophistication of fraudulent activities by third parties using our offerings we may lose the confidence of our customers and government agencies and our revenues and earnings may be harmed 

the online tax preparation payroll administration and online payments industries have been experiencing an increasing amount of fraudulent activities by third parties and those fraudulent activities are becoming increasingly sophisticated although we do not believe that any of this activity is uniquely targeted at our products or business this type of fraudulent activity may adversely impact our consumer tax payroll and payments businesses in addition to any direct damages and potential fines that may result from such fraud which may be substantial a loss of confidence by our customers or by governmental agencies in our ability to prevent fraudulent activity that is perpetrated through our offerings may seriously harm our business and damage our brand if we cannot adequately combat such fraudulent activity that is perpetrated through our tax offerings state or federal tax authorities may refuse to allow us to continue to process our customers’ tax returns electronically resulting in a significant adverse impact on our earnings and revenue as fraudulent activities become more pervasive and increasingly sophisticated and fraud detection and prevention measures must become correspondingly more complex to combat them across the various industries in which we operate we may implement risk control mechanisms that could make it more difficult for legitimate customers to obtain and use our products which could result in lost revenue and negatively impact our earnings 

  

third parties claiming that we infringe their proprietary rights may cause us to incur significant legal expenses and prevent us from selling our products 

we may become increasingly subject to infringement claims including patent copyright trade secret and trademark infringement claims litigation may be necessary to determine the validity and scope of the intellectual property rights of others we have received a number of allegations of intellectual property infringement claims in the past and expect to receive more claims in the future based on allegations that our offerings infringe upon the intellectual property held by third parties some of these claims are the subject of pending litigation against us and against some of our customers these claims may involve patent holding companies or other adverse intellectual property owners who have no relevant product revenues of their own and against whom our own intellectual property may provide little or no deterrence the ultimate outcome of any allegation is uncertain and regardless of outcome any such claim with or without merit may be time consuming to defend result in costly litigation divert management’s time and attention from our business require us to stop selling delay shipping or redesign our products or require us to pay monetary damages for royalty or licensing fees or to satisfy indemnification obligations that we have with some of our customers our failure to obtain necessary license or other rights or litigation arising out of intellectual property claims may harm our business 

we rely on third party intellectual property in our products and services 

many of our products and services include intellectual property of third parties which we license under agreements that may need to be renewed or renegotiated from time to time we may not be able to obtain licenses to these third party technologies or content on reasonable terms or at all if we are unable to obtain the rights necessary to use this intellectual property in our products and services we may not be able to sell the affected offerings and customers who are currently using the affected product may be disrupted which may in turn harm our future financial results damage our brand and result in customer loss also we and our customers have been and may continue to be subject to infringement claims as a result of the third party intellectual property incorporated in to our offerings although we try to mitigate this risk and we may not be ultimately liable for any potential infringement pending claims require us to use significant resources require management attention and could result in loss of customers 

some of our offerings include thirdparty software that is licensed under socalled “open source” licenses some of which may include a requirement that under certain circumstances we make available or grant licenses to any modifications or derivative works we create based upon the open source software although we have established internal review and approval processes to mitigate these risks we may not be sure that all open source software is submitted for approval prior to use in our products many of the risks associated with usage of open source may not be eliminated and may if not properly addressed harm our business 

our intellectual property rights are valuable and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products services and brand 

our patents trademarks trade secrets copyrights and other intellectual property rights are important assets for us we aggressively protect our intellectual property rights by relying on federal state and common law rights in the us and internationally as well as a variety of administrative procedures we also rely on contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary rights in products and services the efforts that we take to protect our proprietary rights may not always be

sufficient or effective protecting our intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming and may not be successful in every location any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business our brand and our ability to compete 

policing unauthorized use and copying of our products is difficult expensive and time consuming current us laws that prohibit copying give us only limited practical protection from software piracy and the laws of many other countries provide very little protection we frequently encounter unauthorized copies of our software being sold through online marketplaces although we continue to evaluate and put in place technology solutions to attempt to lessen the impact of piracy and engage in efforts to educate consumers and public policy leaders on these issues and cooperate with industry groups in their efforts to combat piracy we expect piracy to be a persistent problem that results in lost revenues and increased expenses 

because competition for our key employees is intense we may not be able to attract retain and develop the highly skilled employees we need to support our planned growth 

much of our future success depends on the continued service and availability of skilled personnel including members of our executive team and those in technical marketing and staff positions experienced personnel in the software mobile technologies data science data security and software as a service industries are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense especially in california and india where the majority of our employees are located also as we strive to continue to adapt to technological change and introduce new and enhanced products and business models we must be able to secure maintain and develop the right quality and quantity of engaged and committed talent although we strive to be an employer of choice we may not be able to continue to successfully attract retain and develop key personnel which may cause our business to suffer 

the nature of our products and services necessitates timely product launches and if we experience significant product quality problems or delays it may harm our revenue earnings and reputation 

all of our tax products and many of our nontax products have rigid development timetables that increase the risk of errors in our products and the risk of launch delays our tax preparation software product development cycle is particularly challenging due to the need to incorporate unpredictable tax law and tax form changes each year and because our customers expect high levels of accuracy and a timely launch of these products to prepare and file their taxes by the tax filing deadline due to the complexity of our products and the condensed development cycles under which we operate our products sometimes contain glitches that may unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the software the complexity of our products may also make it difficult for us to consistently deliver offerings that contain the features functionality and level of accuracy that our customers expect when we encounter problems we may be required to modify our code distribute patches to customers who have already purchased the product and recall or repackage existing product inventory in our distribution channels if we encounter development challenges or discover errors in our products late in our development cycle it may cause us to delay our product launch date any major defects or launch delays may lead to loss of customers and revenue negative publicity customer and employee dissatisfaction reduced retailer shelf space and promotions and increased operating expenses such as inventory replacement costs legal fees or payments resulting from our commitment to reimburse penalties and interest paid by customers due solely to calculation errors in our consumer tax preparation products 

our businesses are highly seasonal and our quarterly results could fluctuate significantly 

our consumer tax professional tax and quickbooks offerings have significant and distinct seasonal patterns this has caused significant fluctuations in our quarterly financial results sales of income tax preparation products and services are heavily concentrated from november through april revenue from our quickbooks offerings tends to be highest around calendar year end during our second and third fiscal quarters these seasonal patterns mean that our total net revenue is usually highest during the second and third fiscal quarters ending january 31 and april 30 we typically experience lower total net revenues and operating losses in the first and fourth fiscal quarters ending october 31 and july 31 in the near term we expect the seasonality of our overall business to continue in the longer term we expect the seasonality of certain of our businesses to diminish due to our decision to deliver ongoing enhancements and certain connected services for desktop offerings sold after fiscal 2014 and due to increasing customer preference for online and subscription versions of our offerings but we expect the seasonality of certain other businesses particularly our consumer and professional tax businesses to continue our financial results may also fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year due to a variety of factors including factors that may affect the timing of revenue recognition these include changes to our offerings that result in the inclusion or exclusion of ongoing services changes in product pricing strategies or product sales mix the timing of the availability of federal and state tax forms from taxing agencies and the ability of those agencies to receive electronic tax return submissions changes in consumer behavior and the timing of our discontinuation of support for older product offerings other factors that may affect our quarterly or annual financial results include the timing of acquisitions divestitures and goodwill and acquired intangible asset impairment charges any fluctuations in our operating results may adversely affect our stock price

we are frequently a party to litigation and regulatory inquiries which could result in an unfavorable outcome and have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operation and cash flows 

we are subject to various legal proceedings including class action lawsuits claims and regulatory inquiries that have arisen out of the ordinary conduct of our business and are not yet resolved and additional claims and inquiries may arise in the future the number and significance of these claims and inquiries have increased as our businesses have evolved any proceedings claims or inquiries initiated by or against us whether successful or not may be time consuming result in costly litigation damage awards consent decrees injunctive relief or increased costs of business require us to change our business practices or products require significant amounts of management time result in diversion of significant operations resources or otherwise harm our business and future financial results 

adverse global economic conditions could harm our business and financial condition 

adverse macroeconomic developments could negatively affect our business and financial condition adverse global economic events have caused and could in the future cause disruptions and volatility in global financial markets and increased rates of default and bankruptcy and could impact consumer and small business spending in particular because the majority of our revenue is derived from sales within the us economic conditions in the us have an even greater impact on us than companies with a more diverse international presence challenging economic times could cause potential new customers not to purchase or to delay purchasing of our products and services and could cause our existing customers to discontinue purchasing or delay upgrades of our existing products and services thereby negatively impacting our revenues and future financial results decreased consumer spending levels could also reduce credit and debit card transaction processing volumes causing reductions in our payments revenue poor economic conditions and high unemployment have caused and could in the future cause a significant decrease in the number of tax returns filed which may have a significant effect on the number of tax returns we prepare and file in addition weakness in the enduser consumer and small business markets could negatively affect the cash flow of our distributors and resellers who could in turn delay paying their obligations to us which could increase our credit risk exposure and cause delays in our recognition of revenue or future sales to these customers any of these events could harm our business and our future financial results 

we regularly invest resources to update and improve our internal information technology systems and software platforms should our investments not succeed or if delays or other issues with new or existing internal technology systems and software platforms disrupt our operations our business could be harmed 

we rely on our network and data center infrastructure and internal technology systems for many of our development marketing operational support sales accounting and financial reporting activities we are continually investing resources to update and improve these systems and environments in order to meet existing as well as the growing and changing requirements of our business and customers if we experience prolonged delays or unforeseen difficulties in updating and upgrading our systems and architecture we may experience outages and may not be able to deliver certain offerings and develop new offerings and enhancements that we need to remain competitive such improvements and upgrades are often complex costly and time consuming in addition such improvements can be challenging to integrate with our existing technology systems or may uncover problems with our existing technology systems unsuccessful implementation of hardware or software updates and improvements could result in outages disruption in our business operations loss of revenue or damage to our reputation 

our international operations are subject to increased risks which may harm our business operating results and financial condition 

in addition to uncertainty about our ability to generate revenues from our foreign operations and expand into international markets there are risks inherent in doing business internationally including 

  20 

tables of contents 

 violations of the complex foreign and us laws and regulations that apply to our international operations may result in fines criminal actions or sanctions against us our officers or our employees prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with these laws there can be no assurance that our employees contractors or agents will not violate our policies these risks inherent in our international operations and expansion increase our costs of doing business internationally and may result in harm to our business operating results and financial condition 

if actual product returns exceed returns reserves our future financial results may be harmed 

we ship more desktop software products to our distributors and retailers than we expect them to sell in order to reduce the risk that distributors or retailers may run out of products this is particularly true for our consumer tax products which have a short selling season and for which returns occur primarily in our fiscal third and fourth quarters like many software companies that sell their products through distributors and retailers we have historically accepted significant product returns we establish reserves against revenue for product returns in our financial statements based on estimated returns and we closely monitor product sales and inventory in the retail channel in an effort to maintain adequate reserves in the past returns have not differed significantly from these reserves however if we experience actual returns that significantly exceed reserves it may result in lower net revenue 

unanticipated changes in our income tax rates may affect our future financial results 

our future effective income tax rates may be favorably or unfavorably affected by unanticipated changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or by changes in tax laws or their interpretation in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes these continuous examinations may result in unforeseen taxrelated liabilities which may harm our future financial results 

amortization of acquired intangible assets and impairment charges may cause significant fluctuation in our net income 

our acquisitions have resulted in significant expenses including amortization and impairment of acquired technology and other acquired intangible assets and impairment of goodwill total costs and expenses in these categories were approximately 339 million in fiscal 2015  25 million in fiscal 2014  and 76 million in fiscal 2013  although under current accounting rules goodwill is not amortized we may incur impairment charges related to the goodwill already recorded and to goodwill arising out of future acquisitions we test the impairment of goodwill annually in our fourth fiscal quarter or more frequently if indicators of impairment arise the timing of the formal annual test may result in charges to our statement of operations in our fourth fiscal quarter that may not have been reasonably foreseen in prior periods the total costs and expenses for fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2013 included goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges of 297 million and 46 million at july 31 2015  we had 13 billion  in goodwill and 87  million in net acquired intangible assets on our balance sheet both of which may be subject to impairment charges in the future new acquisitions and any impairment of the value of acquired intangible assets may have a significant negative impact on our future financial results

our acquisition and divestiture activities may disrupt our ongoing business may involve increased expenses and may present risks not contemplated at the time of the transactions 

we have acquired and may continue to acquire companies products and technologies that complement our strategic direction acquisitions involve significant risks and uncertainties including 

 we have divested and may in the future divest certain assets or businesses that no longer fit with our strategic direction or growth targets divestitures involve significant risks and uncertainties including 

 because acquisitions and divestitures are inherently risky our transactions may not be successful and may in some cases harm our operating results or financial condition although we typically fund our acquisitions through cash available from operations if we were to use debt to fund acquisitions or for other purposes our interest expense and leverage would increase significantly and if we were to issue equity securities as consideration in an acquisition current shareholders’ percentage ownership and earnings per share would be diluted 

we have 500 million in debt outstanding and may incur other debt in the future which may adversely affect our financial condition and future financial results 

in fiscal 2007 we issued 500 million in senior unsecured notes due in march 2017 as the debt matures we will have to expend significant resources to either repay or refinance these notes if we decide to refinance the notes we may be required to do so on different or less favorable terms or we may be unable to refinance the notes at all both of which may adversely affect our financial condition

we also have a 500 million fiveyear revolving credit facility we may use the proceeds of any advances against the credit facility for general corporate purposes including future acquisitions and share repurchases 

this debt may adversely affect our financial condition and future financial results by among other things 

 our current revolving credit facility imposes restrictions on us including restrictions on our ability to create liens on our assets and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur indebtedness and require us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios our ability to comply with these ratios may be affected by events beyond our control in addition our short and longterm debt includes covenants that may adversely affect our ability to incur certain liens or engage in certain types of sale and leaseback transactions if we breach any of the covenants under our short and longterm debt or our revolving credit facility and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders then subject to applicable cure periods any outstanding indebtedness may be declared immediately due and payable 

in addition changes by any rating agency to our credit rating may negatively impact the value and liquidity of both our debt and equity securities if our credit ratings are downgraded or other negative action is taken the interest rate payable by us under our revolving credit facility may increase in addition any downgrades in our credit ratings may affect our ability to obtain additional financing in the future and may affect the terms of any such financing 

we are subject to risks associated with information disseminated through our services 

the laws relating to the liability of online services companies for information such as online content disseminated through their services are subject to frequent challenges in spite of settled law in the us claims are made against online services companies by parties who disagree with the content where our online content is accessed on the internet outside of the us challenges may be brought under foreign laws which do not provide the same protections for online services companies as in the us these challenges in either us or foreign jurisdictions may rise to legal claims alleging defamation libel invasion of privacy negligence copyright or trademark infringement or other theories based on the nature and content of the materials disseminated through the services certain of our services include content generated by users of our online services although this content is not generated by us claims of defamation or other injury may be made against us for that content any costs incurred as a result of this potential liability may harm our business 

our stock price may be volatile and your investment could lose value 

our stock price is subject to changes in recommendations or earnings estimates by financial analysts changes in investors’ or analysts’ valuation measures for our stock our credit ratings and market trends unrelated to our performance furthermore speculation in the press or investment community about our strategic position financial condition results of operations business or security of our products can cause changes in our stock price these factors as well as general economic and political conditions and the timing of announcements in the public market regarding new products product enhancements or technological advances by our competitors or us and any announcements by us of acquisitions major transactions or management changes may adversely affect our stock price further any changes in the amounts or frequency of share repurchases or dividends may also adversely affect our stock price a significant drop in our stock price could expose us to the risk of securities class actions lawsuits which may result in substantial costs and divert management’s attention and resources which may adversely affect our business 

our business depends on our strong reputation and the value of our brands 

developing and maintaining awareness of our brands is critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our existing and future products and services and is an important element in attracting new customers adverse publicity whether or not justified relating to events or activities attributed to us our employees or agents may tarnish our reputation and reduce the value of our brands damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity may reduce demand for our products and services and thus have an adverse effect on our future financial results as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of the brands

legal proceedings 

intuit has been contacted by regulatory authorities including congress the federal trade commission the sec the department of justice and certain state attorneys general in connection with the increase during the 2015 tax season in attempts by criminals using stolen identity information to file fraudulent tax returns and claim refunds at the state and federal levels intuit is cooperating with all such government inquiries including formal requests for information in addition we are the subject of certain actions including putative class action lawsuits by individuals who claim to have suffered damages in connection with the foregoing events we believe that the allegations contained within these lawsuits are without merit and we intend to vigorously defend against them 

intuit is subject to certain routine legal proceedings including class action lawsuits like those described above as well as demands claims government inquiries and threatened litigation that arise in the normal course of our business including assertions that we may be infringing patents or other intellectual property rights of others we currently believe that in addition to any amounts accrued the amount of potential losses if any for any pending claims of any type either alone or combined will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements the ultimate outcome of any litigation is uncertain and regardless of outcome litigation can have an adverse impact on intuit because of defense costs negative publicity diversion of management resources and other factors our failure to obtain necessary license or other rights or litigation arising out of intellectual property claims could adversely affect our business

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda includes the following sections 

 you should note that this mda discussion contains forwardlooking statements that involve risks and uncertainties please see the section entitled “forwardlooking statements and risk factors”  at the beginning of item 1a for important information to consider when evaluating such statements 

you should read this mda in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes in item 8 of this annual report in fiscal 2014 we acquired check inc we have included their results of operations in our consolidated results of operations from the date of acquisition 

in fiscal 2013 we completed the sale of our intuit websites business and in fiscal 2014 we completed the sales of our intuit financial services ifs and intuit health businesses in the fourth quarter fiscal 2015 we determined that our demandforce quickbase and quicken businesses became longlived assets held for sale we accounted for all of these businesses as discontinued operations and have therefore reclassified our statements of operations and balance sheets for all periods presented to reflect them as such because the cash flows of these discontinued operations were not material for any period presented we have not segregated the cash flows of those businesses from continuing operations on our statements of cash flows see “results of operations – nonoperating income and expense – discontinued operations”  later in this item 7 for more information unless otherwise noted the following discussion pertains to our continuing operations 

executive overview 

this overview provides a high level discussion of our operating results and some of the trends that affect our business we believe that an understanding of these trends is important in order to understand our financial results for fiscal 2015  as well as our future prospects this summary is not intended to be exhaustive nor is it intended to be a substitute for the detailed discussion and analysis provided elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

industry trends and seasonality 

industry trends 

the industry in which we operate is dynamic and highly competitive and we expect it to remain so in the future the markets for software and related services especially highlyavailable connected services are characterized by rapid technological change shifting customer needs and frequent new product introductions and enhancements competitive interest and expertise 

 29 

tables of contents 

in many of the markets we serve have grown markedly over the past few years and we expect this trend to continue there are also large cloudbased service companies who innovate quickly and serve small businesses and consumers while today our competition with such companies may be limited as we and those companies grow our competition with them may increase in recent years the widespread availability of the internet the emergence of mobile devices and the explosion of social media have accelerated the pace of change and revolutionized the way that people throughout the world manage important financial tasks the result is a global market that is shifting from traditional services that are paperbased humanproduced and brickandmortar bound to one where people understand demand and embrace the benefits of connected services this trend toward connected services is the primary driver of the strategies in all of our businesses 

seasonality 

our consumer tax professional tax and quickbooks offerings have significant and distinct seasonal patterns as a result our total net revenue is usually highest during our second quarter ending january 31 and third quarter ending april 30 we typically report losses in our first quarter ending october 31 and fourth quarter ending july 31 when our total net revenue is lower but core operating expenses such as research and development continue at relatively consistent levels although the seasonal patterns for all three of our reporting segments continue to evolve as described below we expect the overall seasonality of our business to continue to have a significant impact on our quarterly financial results in the future 

our consumer tax and professional tax offerings are highly seasonal sales of income tax preparation products and services are heavily concentrated from november through april in addition an increasing proportion of our consumer tax revenue has been shifting to later in this seasonal period and we expect that trend to continue in the future this is due in part to the growth in sales of turbotax online for which we recognize revenue toward the end of the tax preparation process when tax returns are printed or electronically filed the seasonality of our consumer tax and professional tax revenue is also affected by the timing of the availability of tax forms from taxing agencies and the ability of those agencies to receive electronic tax return submissions delays in the availability of tax forms or the ability of taxing agencies to receive submissions can cause consumer tax and professional tax revenue to shift between our fiscal quarters in fiscal 2015 we began delivering ongoing enhancements and certain connected services for our professional tax desktop software offerings as a result of this change we recognize revenue for these offerings as services are provided through the end of each calendar year 

in our small business segment prior to fiscal 2015 we launched annual releases of our quickbooks desktop software products each fall and revenue for those products tended to be highest around calendar year end during our second and third fiscal quarters starting with quickbooks 2015 which was released in the first quarter of fiscal 2015 we began delivering ongoing enhancements and certain connected services for our quickbooks desktop software products as a result of this change we recognize revenue for these quickbooks desktop products as services are provided over approximately three years customers are also increasingly choosing the online and subscription versions of our quickbooks offerings for which we recognize revenue as the services are provided customer acquisition for these offerings tends to be highest around calendar year end during our second and third fiscal quarters for these reasons the seasonality of our small business segment revenue has started to become less pronounced and we expect that trend to continue in the future 

key challenges and risks 

our growth strategy depends upon our ability to initiate and embrace disruptive technology trends to enter new markets and to drive broad adoption of the products and services we develop and market our future growth also increasingly depends on the strength of our thirdparty business relationships and our ability to continue to develop maintain and strengthen new and existing relationships to remain competitive and continue to grow we are investing significant resources in our product development marketing and sales capabilities and we expect to continue to do so in the future 

as we continue transitioning to offer more connected services the ongoing operation and availability of our information technology and communication systems and those of our external service providers is becoming increasingly important because we help customers manage their financial lives we face risks associated with the hosting collection use and retention of personal customer information and data we are investing significant management attention and resources in our information technology infrastructure and in our privacy and security capabilities and we expect to continue to do so in the future 

during this tax season state taxing authorities the irs and the tax preparation industry experienced an increase in attempts by criminals using stolen identity information to file fraudulent tax returns and claim refunds at the federal level and expanding into the state level in the third quarter of fiscal 2015 we and certain states took the precautionary step of suspending the electronic filing of state tax returns for a short period of time to assess this activity and the measures used to combat it as part of this effort we implemented additional security measures in our products and began working with state governments to share information regarding suspicious filings while continuing to share such information with the federal government in addition as a result of recent events and with the continued focus on the growing industrywide challenge of cyberfraud during this tax season intuit has been contacted by regulatory authorities including congress the federal trade commission the sec the department of justice and certain state attorneys general as previously disclosed intuit is cooperating with all such inquiries

including formal requests for information going forward we expect to continue to invest in security and to work with the broader industry and government to protect our customers against this type of fraud while we have experienced negative publicity associated with this industrywide issue we do not believe our recent financial performance has been materially adversely impacted by this fraudulent activity or by the actions we have taken to combat it however there can be no assurance that our future financial performance will not be adversely impacted 

for a complete discussion of the most significant risks and uncertainties affecting our business please see “forwardlooking statements and risk factors”  in item 1a of this report 

overview of financial results 

the most important financial indicators that we use to assess our business are revenue growth for the company as a whole for each reportable segment and for product lines within each reportable segment operating income growth and operating income margins for the company as a whole and for each reportable segment earnings per share and cash flow from operations we also track certain nonfinancial drivers of revenue growth and when material identify them in the applicable discussions of segment results below these nonfinancial drivers include for example customer growth and retention for all of our businesses and transaction volume for our payment processing business total credit and debit card transaction volume correlates strongly with the macroeconomic environment and is one of the key drivers of revenue growth in our payment processing business customers for our connected services offerings have generally grown faster than those for our traditional desktop software offerings reflecting our strategic focus on connected services over the past few years connected services total service and other revenue generated 30 billion or 73 of our total revenue in fiscal 2015  compared with about 50 of our total revenue seven years ago we expect connected services revenue as a percentage of our total revenue to continue to grow in the future 

total net revenue for fiscal 2015  was 42 billion  a decrease of 1  compared with fiscal 2014  total net revenue results were affected by the change to our desktop software offerings described in “ industry trends and seasonality ” above revenue in our small business segment decreased 2  compared with fiscal 2014  due to the impact of this change on our quickbooks desktop offerings which more than offset quickbooks online revenue growth the change to our desktop software offerings also impacted our professional tax segment whose revenue decreased 33  compared with fiscal 2014 revenue in our consumer tax segment increased 8  compared with fiscal 2014  due to 7 growth in us federal turbotax units 

operating income from continuing operations decreased 43  in fiscal 2015  compared with fiscal 2014  due to the impact of the change to our desktop software offerings on fiscal 2015 revenue and due to higher expenses for staffing sharebased compensation and outside services we also recorded goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges of 148  million to operating expense in fiscal 2015 

net income from continuing operations decreased 52  in fiscal 2015  compared with fiscal 2014  due to the decrease in operating income and a higher effective tax rate that related to the goodwill impairment charge in the fiscal 2015  period diluted net income per share from continuing operations for fiscal 2015  decreased 51  to 145  in line with the decrease in net income for that period 

we ended fiscal 2015  with cash cash equivalents and investments totaling 17 billion  in fiscal 2015  we generated cash from operations net sales of investments and the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans during the same period we used cash for the repurchase of shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs the payment of cash dividends and capital expenditures at july 31 2015  we had authorization from our board of directors to expend up to an additional 26 billion for stock repurchases through may 19 2019

critical accounting policies and estimates 

in preparing our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap we are required to make estimates assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on our net revenue operating income or loss and net income or loss as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our balance sheet we believe that the estimates assumptions and judgments involved in the following accounting policies have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies 

 our senior management has reviewed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and their disclosure in this annual report on form 10k with the audit and risk committee of our board of directors 

revenue recognition 

we derive revenue from the sale of software subscriptions hosted services packaged software products financial supplies technical support plans transaction fees merchant services hardware and multiple element arrangements that may include a combination of these items we follow the appropriate revenue recognition rules for each type of revenue for additional information see “revenue recognition”  in note 1 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report we generally recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists we have delivered the product or performed the service the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable however determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves exercising judgment and using estimates that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report for example for multiple element arrangements containing only software and softwarerelated elements we must exercise judgment and use estimates in order to 1 allocate the total price among the various elements we must deliver 2 determine whether undelivered services are essential to the functionality of the delivered products and services 3 determine whether vendorspecific evidence of fair value exists for each undelivered element and 4 determine whether and when each element has been delivered for multiple element arrangements containing nonsoftware elements we must exercise judgment and use estimates in order to 1 determine whether and when each element has been delivered 2 determine the fair value of each element using the selling price hierarchy of vendorspecific evidence vsoe of fair value if available thirdparty evidence tpe if vsoe is not available and estimated selling price esp if neither vsoe nor tpe is available and 3 allocate the total price among the various elements based on the relative selling price method if we were to change any of these judgments or estimates it could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period amounts for fees collected or invoiced and due relating to arrangements where revenue cannot be recognized are reflected on our balance sheet as deferred revenue and recognized when the applicable revenue recognition criteria are satisfied

as described in “description of business and summary of significant accounting policies – business combinations”  in note 1 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report under the acquisition method of accounting we generally recognize the identifiable assets acquired the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interests in an acquiree at their fair values as of the date of acquisition we measure goodwill as the excess of consideration transferred which we also measure at fair value over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed the acquisition method of accounting requires us to exercise judgment and make significant estimates and assumptions regarding the fair values of the elements of a business combination as of the date of acquisition including the fair values of identifiable intangible assets deferred tax asset valuation allowances liabilities related to uncertain tax positions and contingencies this method also requires us to refine these estimates over a oneyear measurement period to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that if known would have affected the measurement of the amounts recognized as of that date if we are required to retroactively adjust provisional amounts that we have recorded for the fair values of assets and liabilities in connection with acquisitions these adjustments could materially decrease our operating income and net income and result in lower asset values on our balance sheet

significant estimates and assumptions that we must make in estimating the fair value of acquired technology customer lists and other identifiable intangible assets include future cash flows that we expect to generate from the acquired assets if the subsequent actual results and updated projections of the underlying business activity change compared with the assumptions and projections used to develop these values we could record impairment charges in addition we have estimated the economic lives of certain acquired assets and these lives are used to calculate depreciation and amortization expense if our estimates of the economic lives change depreciation or amortization expenses could be accelerated or slowed 

goodwill acquired intangible assets and other longlived assets – impairment assessments 

we estimate the fair value of acquired intangible assets and other longlived assets that have finite useful lives whenever an event or change in circumstances indicates that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable we test for potential impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives annually in our fourth fiscal quarter or whenever indicators of impairment arise the timing of the annual test may result in charges to our statement of operations in our fourth fiscal quarter that could not have been reasonably foreseen in prior periods 

as described in “description of business and summary of significant accounting policies – goodwill acquired intangible assets and other longlived assets”  in note 1 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report in order to estimate the fair value of goodwill we use a weighted combination of a discounted cash flow model known as the income approach and comparisons to publicly traded companies engaged in similar businesses known as the market approach the income approach requires us to use a number of assumptions including market factors specific to the business the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows to be generated by the business over an extended period of time longterm growth rates for the business and a rate of return that considers the relative risk of achieving the cash flows and the time value of money we evaluate cash flows at the reporting unit level although the assumptions we use in our discounted cash flow model are consistent with the assumptions we use to generate our internal strategic plans and forecasts significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of future cash flows from each reporting unit and the relative risk of achieving those cash flows when using the market approach we make judgments about the comparability of publicly traded companies engaged in similar businesses we base our judgments on factors such as size growth rates profitability risk and return on investment we also make judgments when adjusting market multiples of revenue operating income and earnings for these companies to reflect their relative similarity to our own businesses we had a total of 13 billion  in goodwill on our balance sheet at july 31 2015  see note 5 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report for a summary of goodwill by reportable segment 

we estimate the recoverability of acquired intangible assets and other longlived assets that have finite useful lives by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows that we expect the asset to generate in order to estimate the fair value of those assets we estimate the present value of future cash flows from those assets the key assumptions that we use in our discounted cash flow model are the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows to be generated by the asset over an extended period of time and a rate of return that considers the relative risk of achieving the cash flows and the time value of money significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of future cash flows and the relative risk of achieving those cash flows we also make judgments about the remaining useful lives of acquired intangible assets and other longlived assets that have finite lives we had a total of 87 million  in net acquired intangible assets on our balance sheet at july 31 2015  

assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives are complex and often subjective they can be affected by a variety of factors including external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts for example if our future operating results do not meet current forecasts or if we experience a sustained decline in our market capitalization that is determined to be indicative of a reduction in fair value of one or more of our reporting units we may be required to record future impairment charges for goodwill and acquired intangible assets impairment charges could materially decrease our future net income and result in lower asset values on our balance sheet 

during the fourth quarters of fiscal 2015  fiscal 2014  and fiscal 2013  we performed our annual goodwill impairment tests using the methodology described in “description of business and summary of significant accounting policies – goodwill acquired intangible assets and other longlived assets”  in note 1 to the financial statements in part 8 of this annual report we determined that the estimated fair values of all of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values and that they were not impaired in addition during this analysis we concluded that the estimated fair values of all of our reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying values 

during the third quarter of fiscal 2015 there was a significant decline in the revenue and operating income forecast for our consumer ecosystem reporting unit as a result of this development we performed an interim impairment test of goodwill and acquired intangible assets for that reporting unit we concluded that the carrying value of goodwill associated with our consumer ecosystem reporting unit was impaired and we recorded an impairment charge of 263  million that reduced the carrying value of goodwill to 211 million as of april 30 2015 see “ fair value measurements – assets and liabilities

measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis”  in note 2 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report for more information 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 management approved a plan to sell our quicken business which was part of our consumer ecosystem reporting unit and we accounted for it as discontinued operations as a result we reclassified a portion of the goodwill impairment charge that we recorded in the third quarter of fiscal 2015 to discontinued operations based on the relative fair values of quicken and the remaining components of our consumer ecosystem reporting unit 

in march 2013 the largest customer for our intuit health business acquired a company that offered similar solutions and competed with us directly in that market space as a result we performed an interim impairment test of goodwill and acquired intangible assets during the third quarter of fiscal 2013 we concluded that the carrying amounts of goodwill and certain definitelived acquired intangible assets associated with our intuit health business were impaired and recorded an impairment charge of approximately 46 million that reduced the carrying value of those assets to zero see “ fair value measurements – assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis”  in note 2 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report for more information in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 management approved a plan to sell our intuit health business and we accounted for it as discontinued operations in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 we completed the sale for cash consideration that was not significant intuit health was part of our former other businesses reportable segment 

accounting for sharebased compensation plans 

at july 31 2015  there was 513  million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested sharebased compensation arrangements granted under all equity compensation plans which we will amortize to expense in the future total unrecognized compensation cost will be adjusted for future changes in estimated forfeitures we expect to recognize that cost over a weighted average vesting period of 23  years 

we use a lattice binomial model and the assumptions described in note 11 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report to estimate the fair value of stock options granted we estimate the expected term of options granted based on implied exercise patterns using a binomial model we estimate the volatility of our common stock at the date of grant based on the implied volatility of publicly traded oneyear and twoyear options on our common stock our decision to use implied volatility is based upon the availability of actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility we base the riskfree interest rate that we use in our option valuation model on the implied yield in effect at the time of option grant on constant maturity us treasury issues with equivalent remaining terms we use an annualized expected dividend yield in our option valuation model we estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates we use historical data to estimate prevesting option forfeitures and record sharebased compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest we amortize the fair value of options on a straightline basis over the requisite service periods of the awards which are generally the vesting periods we may elect to use different assumptions under our option valuation model in the future which could materially affect our net income or loss and net income or loss per share 

restricted stock units rsus granted typically vest based on continued service we value these timebased rsus at the date of grant using the intrinsic value method adjusted for estimated forfeitures we amortize the fair value of timebased rsus on a straightline basis adjusted for estimated forfeitures over the service period certain rsus granted to senior management vest based on the achievement of preestablished performance or market goals we estimate the fair value of performancebased rsus at the date of grant using the intrinsic value method and the probability that the specified performance criteria will be met adjusted for estimated forfeitures each quarter we update our assessment of the probability that the specified performance criteria will be achieved and adjust our estimate of the fair value of the performancebased rsus if necessary we amortize the fair values of performancebased rsus over the requisite service period adjusted for estimated forfeitures for each separately vesting tranche of the award we estimate the fair value of marketbased rsus at the date of grant using a monte carlo valuation methodology and amortize those fair values over the requisite service period adjusted for estimated forfeitures for each separately vesting tranche of the award the monte carlo methodology that we use to estimate the fair value of marketbased rsus at the date of grant incorporates into the valuation the possibility that the market condition may not be satisfied provided that the requisite service is rendered the total fair value of the marketbased rsus at the date of grant must be recognized as compensation expense even if the market condition is not achieved however the number of shares that ultimately vest can vary significantly with the performance of the specified market criteria all of the rsus we grant have dividend rights that are subject to the same vesting requirements as the underlying equity awards so we do not adjust the intrinsic market value of our rsus for dividends see note 11 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report for more information

legal contingencies 

we are subject to certain legal proceedings as well as demands claims and threatened litigation that arise in the normal course of our business we review the status of each significant matter quarterly and assess our potential financial exposure if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated we record a liability and an expense for the estimated loss if we determine that a loss is possible and the range of the loss can be reasonably determined then we disclose the range of the possible loss significant judgment is required in the determination of whether a potential loss is probable reasonably possible or remote as well as in the determination of whether a potential exposure is reasonably estimable our accruals are based on the best information available at the time as additional information becomes available we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates potential legal liabilities and the revision of estimates of potential legal liabilities could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 

accounting for income taxes – estimates of deferred taxes valuation allowances and uncertain tax positions 

we estimate our income taxes based on the various jurisdictions where we conduct business significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax rules and the potential for future adjustment of our uncertain tax positions by the united states internal revenue service or other taxing jurisdictions we estimate our current tax liability and assess temporary differences that result from differing treatments of certain items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which we show on our balance sheet we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized to the extent we believe that realization is not likely we establish a valuation allowance when we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in an accounting period we record a corresponding tax expense in our statement of operations 

at july 31 2015  we had net deferred tax assets of 185 million  which included a valuation allowance of 30 million  for loss and tax credit carryforwards related to state tax credits state capital and operating losses and foreign losses we recorded the valuation allowance to reflect uncertainties about whether we will be able to utilize some of our deferred tax assets before they expire while we believe our current valuation allowance is sufficient we could in the future be required to increase the valuation allowance to take into account additional deferred tax assets that we may be unable to realize we assess the need for an adjustment to the valuation allowance on a quarterly basis the assessment is based on our estimates of future sources of taxable income for the jurisdictions in which we operate and the periods over which our deferred tax assets will be realizable see note 10 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report for more information 

we recognize and measure benefits for uncertain tax positions using a twostep approach the first step is to evaluate the tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon audit including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes for tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely of being realized upon settlement significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions we evaluate our uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis our evaluations are based upon a number of factors including changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law correspondence with tax authorities during the course of audits and effective settlement of audit issues changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in material increases or decreases in our income tax expense in the period in which we make the change which could have a material impact on our effective tax rate and operating results

income taxes 

effective tax rate 

our effective tax rates for fiscal 2015  fiscal 2014  and fiscal 2013  were approximately 42  34  and 32  excluding discrete tax items primarily related to the goodwill impairment charge our effective tax rate for fiscal 2015 was approximately 36 the differences between these rates and the federal statutory rate of 35 were primarily related to the tax benefit received from the domestic production activities deduction and the federal research and experimentation credit partially offset by state income taxes see note 10 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report for more information about our effective tax rates 

net deferred tax assets 

at july 31 2015  we had net deferred tax assets of 185 million which included a valuation allowance of 30  million for loss and tax credit carryforwards related to state tax credits state capital and operating losses and foreign losses we recorded the valuation allowance to reflect uncertainties about whether we will be able to utilize some of our deferred tax assets before they expire while we believe our current valuation allowance is sufficient we could in the future be required to increase the valuation allowance to take into account additional deferred tax assets that we may be unable to realize we assess the need for an adjustment to the valuation allowance on a quarterly basis the assessment is based on our estimates of future sources of taxable income for the jurisdictions in which we operate and the periods over which our deferred tax assets will be realizable see note 10 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report for more information 

discontinued operations 

we have reclassified our statements of operations for all periods presented to reflect the businesses below as discontinued operations see note 7 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report for a more complete description of these discontinued operations and the impact that they have had on our statements of operations for the fiscal periods presented

tables of contents 

discussed in “executive overview – industry trends and seasonality”  earlier in this item 7 our business is subject to significant seasonality the balance of our cash cash equivalents and investments generally fluctuates with that seasonal pattern we believe the seasonality of our business is likely to continue in the future 

the following table summarizes selected measures of our liquidity and capital resources at the dates indicated 



we have historically generated significant cash from operations and we expect to continue to do so during fiscal 2016  since our operations are primarily domestic approximately 90  of our cash cash equivalents and investments at july 31 2015  were located in the us and none of those funds were restricted our only significant debt consists of 500 million in senior unsecured notes due in march 2017 we also have an unused 500 million unsecured revolving line of credit facility available to us for general corporate purposes including future acquisitions and stock repurchases 

we evaluate on an ongoing basis the merits of acquiring technology or businesses or establishing strategic relationships with and investing in other companies our strong liquidity profile enables us to respond nimbly to these kinds of opportunities 

based on past performance and current expectations we believe that our cash and cash equivalents investments and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet anticipated seasonal working capital needs capital expenditure requirements contractual obligations commitments debt service requirements and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations for at least the next 12 months we expect to return excess cash generated by operations to our stockholders through repurchases of our common stock and payment of cash dividends after taking into account our operating and strategic cash needs

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

investment portfolio 

we actively monitor market conditions and developments specific to the securities in which we invest we believe that we take a conservative approach to investing our funds in that we invest only in highlyrated securities and diversify our portfolio of investments while we believe we take prudent measures to mitigate investment related risks such risks cannot be fully eliminated because of market circumstances that are outside our control 

our investments consist of instruments that meet quality standards that are consistent with our investment policy this policy specifies that except for direct obligations of the united states government securities issued by agencies of the united states government and money market funds we diversify our investments by limiting our holdings with any individual issuer we do not hold derivative financial instruments or european sovereign debt in our portfolio of investments see note 3 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report for a summary of the amortized cost and fair value of our investments by type of issue

tables of contents 

the following table presents our portfolio of cash equivalents and availableforsale debt securities as of july 31 2015  by stated maturity the table is classified by the original maturity date listed on the security and includes cash equivalents which consist primarily of money market funds at july 31 2015  the weighted average tax adjusted interest rate earned on our money market accounts was 03  and the weighted average tax adjusted interest rate earned on our investments was 061  



interest rate risk 

our cash equivalents and investments are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates interest rate movements affect the interest income we earn on cash equivalents and investments and the value of those investments if the federal reserve target rate had increased by 25 basis points from the level of july 31 2015  the value of our investments at that date would have decreased by approximately 3  million if the federal reserve target rate had increased by 100 basis points from the level of july 31 2015  the value of our investments at that date would have decreased by approximately 11 million 

we are also exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates as they affect our 500 million revolving credit facility advances under the credit facility accrue interest at rates that are equal to jp morgan’s alternate base rate plus a margin that ranges from 00  to 05  or the london interbank offered rate libor plus a margin that ranges from 09  to 15  in both cases based on our senior debt credit ratings consequently our interest expense would fluctuate with changes in the general level of these interest rates if we were to borrow any amounts under the credit facility at july 31 2015  no amounts were outstanding under the credit facility 

on march 12 2007 we issued 500 million of 575 senior unsecured notes due on march 15 2017 we carry these senior notes at face value less unamortized discount on our balance sheets since these senior notes bear interest at fixed rates we have no financial statement risk associated with changes in interest rates however the fair value of these notes fluctuates when interest rates change see note 2 and note 9 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report for more information 

impact of foreign currency rate changes 

the functional currencies of our international operating subsidiaries are generally the local currencies we translate the assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries at the exchange rates in effect on the balance sheet date we translate their revenue costs and expenses at the average rates of exchange in effect during the period we include translation gains and losses in the stockholders’ equity section of our balance sheets we include net gains and losses resulting from foreign exchange transactions in interest and other income in our statements of operations 

since we translate foreign currencies primarily canadian dollars indian rupees and british pounds into us dollars for financial reporting purposes currency fluctuations can have an impact on our financial results the historical impact of currency fluctuations has generally been immaterial we believe that our exposure to currency exchange fluctuation risk is not significant primarily because our global subsidiaries invoice customers and satisfy their financial obligations almost exclusively in their local currencies although the impact of currency fluctuations on our financial results has generally been immaterial in the past and we believe that for the reasons cited above currency fluctuations will not be significant in the future the impact of currency fluctuations could be material in the future as of july 31 2015  we did not engage in foreign currency hedging activities

based upon an evaluation of the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures intuit’s chief executive officer ceo and chief financial officer cfo have concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on form 10k our disclosure controls and procedures as defined under exchange act rules 13a15e and 15d15e were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our exchange act reports is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the securities and exchange commission and is accumulated and communicated to management including the ceo and cfo as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in exchange act rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of july 31 2015  based on the guidelines established in internal control – integrated framework  issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso based on the results of this evaluation our management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of july 31 2015  to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles we reviewed the results of management’s assessment with the audit and risk committee of intuit’s board of directors 

ernst  young llp an independent registered public accounting firm has audited the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of july 31 2015  their report is included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

during our most recent fiscal quarter there has not occurred any change in our internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls 

our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer believes that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and that they are effective at the reasonable assurance level however no matter how well conceived and executed a control system can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met the design of any control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs there are also limitations that are inherent in any control system these limitations include the realities that breakdowns can occur because of errors in judgment or mistakes and that controls can be circumvented by individual persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls because of these inherent limitations in a cost effective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected

our tax offerings for accounting professionals are lacerte proseries and intuit tax online lacerte software is designed for fullservice accounting firms that prepare the most complex returns we offer two versions of our proseries software proseries professional edition designed for yearround tax practices that prepare moderately complex tax returns and proseries basic edition designed for the needs of smaller and seasonal tax practices intuit tax online is designed for yearround tax practices that prepare moderately complex tax returns and want the advantages of an online offering accounting professionals license these tax products for a flat fee for unlimited use or use them to print or electronically file tax returns on a “payperreturn” basis accountants and tax preparers using lacerte proseries and intuit tax online can file their clients’ tax returns using our electronic filing services 

product development 

since the markets for software and related services are characterized by rapid technological change shifting customer needs and frequent new product introductions and enhancements a continuous high level of investment is required to innovate and quickly develop new products and services as well as enhance existing offerings our product development efforts are becoming more important than ever as we pursue our connected services strategy which reflects a world where people and businesses are increasingly connected by technology and expect access to services at any time in any place 

we develop many of our products and services internally we have a number of united states and foreign patents and pending applications that relate to various aspects of our products and technology we supplement our internal development efforts by acquiring or licensing products and technology from third parties and establishing other relationships that enable us to enhance or expand our offerings more rapidly we expect to expand our third party technology relationships as we continue to pursue our connected services strategy 

our traditional desktop software products – quickbooks turbotax lacerte proseries and quicken – tend to have predictable annual development and product release cycles we also develop innovative new offerings such as snaptax snap payroll gopayment mint mobile and other mobile applications for which development cycles are often more rapid developing consumer and professional tax software and services presents unique challenges because of the demanding development cycle required to accurately incorporate federal and state tax law and tax form changes within a rigid timetable the development timing for our small business payroll and merchant payment processing services offerings varies with business needs and regulatory requirements and the length of the development cycle depends on the scope and complexity of each project 

we continue to make substantial investments in research and development and we expect to focus our future research and development efforts on enhancing existing products and services and on developing new products and services including new mobile and global offerings we also expect to continue to focus significant research and development efforts on ongoing projects to update the technology platforms for several of our offerings our research and development expenses were 758  million or 17  of total net revenue in fiscal 2014  685 million or 17  of total net revenue in fiscal 2013  and 618 million or 16  of total net revenue in fiscal 2012  

seasonality 

historically our quickbooks consumer tax and professional tax offerings have been highly seasonal revenue from our quickbooks desktop software products has tended to be highest during our second and third fiscal quarters sales of income tax preparation products and services are heavily concentrated from november through april in our consumer tax business a greater proportion of our revenue has shifted to later in this seasonal period due in part to the growth in sales of turbotax online for which we recognize revenue when tax returns are printed or electronically filed the seasonality of our consumer tax and professional tax revenue is also affected by the timing of the availability of tax forms from taxing agencies and the ability of those agencies to receive electronic tax return submissions delays in the availability of tax forms or the ability of taxing agencies to receive submissions can cause revenue to shift between our fiscal quarters these seasonal patterns mean that our total net revenue is usually highest during our second quarter ending january 31 and third quarter ending april 30 we typically report losses in our first quarter ending october 31 and fourth quarter ending july 31 during these quarters revenue from our tax businesses is minimal while core operating expenses such as research and development continue at relatively consistent levels

tables of contents 

in august 2014 we announced that we will begin delivering ongoing releases for our future desktop offerings in order to continuously improve the product experience accommodate operating system updates and provide access to connected services this decision will affect the timing of revenue recognition for future sales of our quickbooks and quicken desktop products where revenue will be recognized over approximately three years and our professional tax solutions where more revenue will be recognized later in the tax year we expect the seasonality of our small business and professional tax offerings to be partially mitigated by this change beginning in fiscal 2015 

marketing sales and distribution channels 

markets 

our primary target customers are small businesses consumers and accounting professionals the markets in which we compete have always been characterized by rapid technological change shifting customer needs and frequent new product introductions and enhancements by competitors over the past several years the widespread availability of the internet mobile devices and the explosion of social media have accelerated the pace of change and revolutionized the way that customers learn about evaluate and purchase products and services 

realtime personalized online and mobile shopping experiences are rapidly becoming the standard in addition many customers now begin shopping in one channel and ultimately purchase in another this creates a need for integrated multichannel shopandbuy experiences market and industry changes quickly make existing products and services obsolete our success depends on our ability to respond rapidly to these changes with new business models updated competitive strategies new or enhanced products and services alternative distribution methods and other changes in the way we do business 

marketing programs 

to sell our products and services to small businesses consumers and accounting professionals we use a variety of traditional and innovative marketing programs to generate software orders stimulate demand and generally maintain and increase customer awareness of our product portfolio these programs include web marketing and targeted advertising such as search engine optimization and purchasing key words from major search engine companies placing and promoting our mobile applications in proprietary online stores directresponse mail and email campaigns telephone solicitations newspaper magazine billboard radio and television advertising social media campaigns and coordinated promotional offers with major retailers we also use workflowintegrated inproduct discovery in some of our software products to market other related products and services including thirdparty products and services in addition we create marketing campaigns that attract new users through free promotional offerings that are designed to ultimately convert them to paying customers 

sales and distribution channels 

multichannel shopandbuy experiences  our consumer and small business customers increasingly use the internet and mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets to research products and services some customers buy and use our products and services entirely online or through their mobile devices others purchase desktop products and services using the internet still others make their final decision at a retail location we coordinate our websites promotions and retail displays to support this integrated multichannel shopandbuy model 

direct sales channel  we sell many of our products and services for small businesses consumers and accounting professionals directly through our websites and call centers telesales continues to be an effective channel for serving customers that want live help to select the products and services that are right for their needs 

retail channel  we sell our quickbooks turbotax and quicken desktop software as well as payroll services and merchant credit card payment processing services at retail locations across the united states we sell these products and services directly and through distributors to office supply superstores warehouse clubs consumer electronics retailers general mass merchandisers online retailers and catalogs in canada and other international markets we also rely on distributors and other third parties who sell products into the retail channel the retail channel provides broad customer reach through retailersponsored advertising and exposure to retail foot traffic this channel also gives us the opportunity to communicate our products services and messages through multiple touch points and allows us to serve our customers at relatively modest cost 

online mobile application stores   we distribute many of our offerings for mobile devices through proprietary online stores that provide applications for specific devices these include the apple app store which provides apps for the apple iphone and ipad and google’s play store which provides apps for androidcompatible smartphones and tablets

other channels  we have strategies to address the alliance partner solution provider and personal computer hardware manufacturer channels we sell our consumer and small business products and services through selected alliance partners primarily banks credit unions and securities and investment firms these alliance partners help us reach new customers at the point of transaction and drive growth and market share by extending our online reach solution providers combine our products and services with valueadded marketing sales and technical expertise to deliver a complete solution at the local level relationships with selected personal computer hardware manufacturers help us attract new customers for our core software offerings as we expand our mobile and global offerings we expect that strategic partnerships will become increasingly important to our business 

competition 

overview 

we face intense competition in all of our businesses both domestically and internationally competitive interest and expertise in many of the markets we serve have grown markedly over the past few years and we expect this trend to continue some of our existing competitors have significantly greater financial technical and marketing resources than we do in addition the competitive landscape can shift rapidly as new companies enter markets in which we compete this is particularly true for online and mobile products and services where the barriers to entry are lower than they are for desktop software products and services to attract customers many online and mobile competitors are offering free or lowpriced entrylevel products which we must take into account in our pricing strategies 

our most obvious competition comes from other companies that offer technology solutions similar to ours however for many of our products and services other important competitive alternatives for customers are third party service providers such as professional accountants and seasonal assisted tax preparation businesses manual tools and processes or generalpurpose software are also important competitive alternatives 

competition specific to segments 

small business segment  our quickbooks desktop product is the leading small business financial management software in the us retail channel our small business products and services face competitive challenges from companies such as the sage group plc which offers software and associated services that directly target small business customers increasingly our small business products and services also face competition from newer online accounting offerings from companies such as xero free or lowcost online accounting offerings and free online banking and bill payment services offered by financial institutions and others in our payroll business we compete directly with automatic data processing inc adp paychex and many other companies with payroll offerings including online payroll offerings in our merchant services business we compete directly with large financial institutions such as wells fargo jp morgan chase and bank of america and with many payment processors including first data corporation elavon global payments fiscertegy paypal and square 

consumer segment  in our consumer tax business our future growth depends on our ability to attract new customers to the selfpreparation tax category from tax stores and other seasonal assisted tax preparers in the private sector we face intense competition from hr block which provides assisted tax preparation services in its stores and a competing software offering called hr block at home we also face competition from several other large assisted tax preparation service providers from a myriad of small seasonal tax preparers and from numerous online selfpreparation offerings including 2nd story software’s taxact these competing offerings subject us to significant price pressure 

we also face competitive challenges in our consumer tax business from publicly funded government entities that offer electronic tax preparation and filing services at no cost to individual taxpayers we are a member of the free file alliance a consortium of private sector companies that has entered into an agreement with the federal government under this agreement the member companies provide online federal tax preparation and filing services at no cost to eligible federal taxpayers and the federal government has agreed not to provide a competing service approximately 23 states have also adopted free file alliance publicprivate agreements while approximately 19 other states offer some form of direct government tax preparation and filing services free to qualified taxpayers we continue to actively work with others in the private and public sectors to advance the goals of the free file alliance policy initiative and to support successful publicprivate partnerships however future administrative regulatory or legislative activity in this area could harm our consumer tax business

tables of contents 

in our consumer ecosytem business we face competition from newer online and mobile personal finance offerings as well as from traditional financial institutions some of these newer competitors are solving specific consumer tasks such as budgeting and credit scores while online and mobileonly banks are offering alternatives to traditional banking traditional financial institutions continue to offer bill payment and personal finance solutions 

professional tax segment  our lacerte professional tax offerings face competition from competitivelypriced tax and accounting solutions that include integration with nontax functionality these include cch’s prosystems fx office suite and thomson reuters’ cs professional suite and gosystems tax our proseries professional tax offerings face competition from cch’s atx and taxwise offerings we also face growing competition from online tax and accounting offerings which may be marketed more effectively or have lower pricing than our offerings for accounting professionals 

competitive factors 

we believe the most important competitive factors for our core offerings – quickbooks turbotax lacerte proseries and quicken – are ease of use product features size of the installed customer base brand name recognition value proposition cost reliability and product and support quality access to distribution channels is also important for our quickbooks turbotax and quicken software products in addition support from accounting professionals and the ability for customers to upgrade within product families as their businesses grow are significant competitive factors for our quickbooks products productivity is an important competitive factor for the fullservice accounting firms to which we market our lacerte software products we believe we compete effectively on these factors as our quickbooks turbotax and quicken products are the leading products in the us retail sales channel for their respective categories 

for our service offerings such as small business payroll and merchant payment processing we believe the most important competitive factors are functionality ease of use high availability the integration of these products with related software brand name recognition effective distribution quality of support and cost 

customer service and technical support 

we provide customer service and technical support by telephone email online chat text messaging online communities and our customer service and technical support websites we have fulltime and outsourced customer service and technical support staffs we supplement these staffs with seasonal employees and additional outsourcing during periods of peak call volumes such as during the tax return filing season or following a major product launch we outsource to several firms domestically and internationally most of our internationally outsourced consumer and small business customer service and technical support personnel are currently located in india and the philippines 

we offer free selfhelp information through our technical support websites for our quickbooks turbotax professional tax and quicken software products customers can use our websites to find answers to commonly asked questions and check on the status of orders under certain paid support plans customers can also use our websites to receive product updates electronically support alternatives and fees vary by product we sponsor online user communities such as intuit community for small businesses and accounting professionals and turbotax live community where consumers can share knowledge and product advice with each other we also offer live tax advice from usbased tax professionals to turbotax users 

manufacturing and distribution 

online products and services 

intuit’s data centers house most of the systems networks and databases required to operate and deliver our online products and services these include quickbooks online online payroll services merchant payment processing services online customer marketing and communication services for small businesses turbotax online intuit tax online consumer and professional electronic tax filing services and mint through our data centers we connect customers to our products and services and store customer and business information as our businesses continue to move toward delivering more online and mobile products and services in conjunction with our connected services strategy we expect that our infrastructure will become even more critical to our business in the future 

our primary data centers are a facility we own in washington state and a colocated data center in nevada we also have a number of other data centers that are primarily located in the western united states and canada we continue to execute on a multiyear plan to transition to fewer data centers in more geographically diverse locations in addition we have an enterprise agreement with amazon web services and over time will be hosting an increasing number of our applications and services in their secure online environment 

desktop software and supplies 

the key processes in manufacturing desktop software are manufacturing compact discs cds and digital video discs dvds printing boxes and related materials and assembling and shipping the final products 

for retail manufacturing we have an agreement with arvato digital services inc adis a division of bertelsmann ag under which adis provides a majority of the manufacturing volume for our launches of quickbooks turbotax and quicken as well as for daytoday replenishment after product launches adis has operations in multiple locations that can provide

tables of contents 

redundancy if necessary we also have an agreement with jvc america inc under which jvc provides outsourced manufacturing volume for these launches and for daytoday replenishment 

for retail distribution we have an agreement with adis under which adis handles all logistics services our retail product launches are operationally complex our model for product delivery for retail launches and replenishment is a hybrid of direct to store deliveries and shipments to central warehouse locations this allows improved inventory management by our retailers we also ship products for many of our smaller retail customers through distributors 

adis also provides most of the manufacturing volume and distribution services for our direct desktop software orders we have an exclusive agreement with harland clarke a division of mf worldwide corporation to fulfill orders for all of our printed checks and most other products for our financial supplies business 

we have multiple sources for all of our raw materials and availability has historically not been a significant problem for us we continue to see consolidation among cddvd suppliers and reduced demand overall for this media type as a result we believe cddvd media may become more difficult to obtain in the next three to five years 

prior to major product releases for our core desktop software products we tend to have significant levels of backlog but at other times backlog is minimal and we typically ship products within a few days of receiving an order because of this fluctuation in backlog we believe that backlog is not a reliable predictor of our future core desktop software sales 

privacy and security of customer information and transactions 

we are subject to various federal state and international laws and regulations and to financial institution and healthcare provider requirements relating to the privacy and security of customer and employee personal information we are also subject to laws and regulations that apply to the internet behavioral tracking mobile applications telemarketing email activities data hosting and retention financial and health information and credit reporting additional laws in all of these areas are likely to be passed in the future which could result in significant limitations on or changes to the ways in which we can collect use host store or transmit the personal information and data of our customers or employees communicate with our customers and deliver products and services or may significantly increase our compliance costs as our business expands to new industry segments and new uses of data that are regulated for privacy and security or to countries outside the united states that have strict data protections laws our compliance requirements and costs will increase 

through a master privacy policy framework designed to be consistent with globally recognized privacy principles we comply with united states federal and other country guidelines and practices to help ensure that customers and employees are aware of and can control how we use information about them our primary websites and online products such as intuitcom quickbooks and turbotax have been certified by truste an independent organization that operates a website and online product privacy certification program representing industry standard practices to address users’ and regulators’ concerns about online privacy we also use privacy statements to provide notice to customers of our privacy practices as well as provide them the opportunity to furnish instructions with respect to use of their personal information we participate in industry groups whose purpose is to develop or influence industry best practices and to influence public policy for privacy and security 

to address security concerns we use security safeguards to help protect the systems and the information customers give to us from loss misuse and unauthorized alteration whenever customers transmit sensitive information such as a credit card number or tax return data through one of our websites or products we use industry standards to encrypt the data as it is transmitted to us we work to protect our systems from unauthorized internal or external access using numerous commercially available computer security products as well as internally developed security procedures and practices

government regulation 

our consumer tax and professional tax businesses are subject to federal and state government requirements including regulations related to the electronic filing of tax returns the provision of tax preparer assistance and the use and disclosure of customer information in addition we offer certain other products and services such as small business payroll and merchant payment processing services which are subject to special regulatory requirements as we expand our products and services both domestically and internationally we may become subject to additional government regulation further regulators may adopt new laws or regulations or their interpretation of existing laws or regulations may differ from ours these increased regulatory requirements could impose significant limitations on our business and increase our cost of compliance 

we are subject to federal and state laws and government regulations concerning employee safety and health and environmental matters the occupational safety and health administration the environmental protection agency and other federal and state agencies have the authority to put regulations in place that may have an impact on our operations 

intellectual property 

our success depends on the proprietary technology embodied in our offerings we protect this proprietary technology by relying on a variety of intellectual property mechanisms including copyright patent trade secret and trademark laws restrictions on disclosure and other methods for example we regularly file applications for patents copyrights and trademarks and service marks in order to protect intellectual property that we believe is important to our business we hold a growing patent portfolio that we believe is important to intuits overall competitive advantage although we are not materially dependent on any one patent or particular group of patents in our portfolio at this time we also have a number of registered trademarks that include intuit quickbooks turbotax lacerte proseries quicken and mint we have registered these and other trademarks and service marks in the united states and depending on the relevance of each brand to other markets in many foreign countries most registrations can be renewed perpetually at 10year intervals we also license intellectual property from third parties for use in our products 

although our portfolio of patents is growing the patents that have been issued to us could be determined to be invalid and may not be enforceable against competitive products in every jurisdiction in addition third parties have asserted and may in the future assert infringement claims against us and our customers these claims and any litigation may result in invalidation of our proprietary rights or a finding of infringement along with an assessment of damages litigation even if without merit could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention in addition third party licenses may not continue to be available to us on commercially acceptable terms or at all 

employees 

as of july 31 2014  we had approximately 8000  fulltime employees in major offices in the united states canada india the united kingdom and other locations we also employ a significant number of seasonal and contract employees during the second and third quarters of our fiscal years to support our consumer tax customers for example at the peak of the 2013  tax season we employed approximately  750  seasonal employees we believe our future success and growth will depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees in all areas of our business we do not currently have any collective bargaining agreements with our employees and we believe employee relations are generally good although we have employmentrelated agreements with a number of key employees these agreements do not guarantee continued service we believe we offer competitive compensation and a good working environment we were named one of fortune  magazine’s “100 best companies to work for” in each of the last thirteen years however we face intense competition for qualified employees and we expect to face continuing challenges in recruiting and retention

we face intense competitive pressures that may harm our operating results 

we face intense competition in all of our businesses and we expect competition to remain intense in the future our competitors and potential competitors range from large and established entities to emerging startups our competitors may introduce superior products and services reduce prices have greater technical marketing and other resources have greater name recognition have larger installed bases of customers have wellestablished relationships with our current and potential customers advertise aggressively or beat us to market with new products and services in addition we may face competition from existing companies with large established consumer userbases and broadbased platforms who may change or expand the focus of their business strategies and marketing to target our customers including small businesses and tax customers we also face intensified competition from providers of free accounting tax payments and other financial services in order to compete we have also introduced free offerings in several categories but we may not be able to attract customers or effectively monetize all of these offerings and customers who have formerly paid for intuit’s products and services may elect to use free offerings instead these competitive factors may diminish our revenue and profitability and harm our ability to acquire and retain customers 

our consumer tax business also faces significant competition from the public sector where we face the risk of federal and state taxing authorities developing software or other systems to facilitate tax return preparation and electronic filing at no charge to taxpayers these or similar programs may be introduced or expanded in the future which may cause us to lose customers and revenue although the free file alliance has kept the federal government from being a direct competitor to intuit’s tax offerings it has fostered additional online competition and may cause us to lose significant revenue opportunities the current agreement with the free file alliance is scheduled to expire in october 2015 we anticipate that governmental encroachment at both the federal and state levels may present a continued competitive threat to our business for the foreseeable future 

future revenue growth depends upon our ability to adapt to technological change and successfully introduce new and enhanced products services and business models 

the software as a service desktop software and mobile technology industries are characterized by rapidly changing technology evolving industry standards and frequent new product introductions as we continue to grow our software as a service mobile and other offerings we must continue to innovate and develop new products and features to meet changing customer needs and attract and retain talented software developers we need to continue to develop our skills tools and capabilities to capitalize on existing and emerging technologies which require us to devote significant resources 

a number of our businesses also derive a significant amount of their revenue from onetime upfront license fees and rely on customer upgrades and service offerings to generate a significant portion of their revenues in addition our consumer and professional tax businesses depend significantly on revenue from customers who return each year to use our updated tax preparation and filing software and services as our existing products mature encouraging customers to purchase product upgrades becomes more challenging unless new product releases provide features and functionality that have meaningful incremental value if we are not able to develop and clearly demonstrate the value of new or upgraded products or services to our customers our revenues may be harmed in addition as we continue to introduce and expand our new business models including offerings that are subscriptionbased or that are free to end users we may be unsuccessful in monetizing or increasing customer adoption of these offerings 

the number of people who access products and services through devices other than personal computers including mobile phones smartphones and handheld computers such as tablets continues to increase we have devoted significant resources to develop products and services for users of these alternative devices but the versions of our products and services developed for these devices may not be compelling to users even if we are able to attract new users through these mobile offerings the amount of revenue that we derive per user from mobile offerings may be less than the revenue that we have historically derived from users of personal computers as new devices and new platforms are continually being released it is difficult to predict the problems we may encounter in developing versions of our products and services for use on these alternative devices and we may need to devote significant resources to the creation support and maintenance of such offerings if we are slow to develop products and technologies that are compatible with these alternative devices or if our competitors are able to achieve those results more quickly than us we will fail to capture a significant share of an increasingly important portion of the market for online services which could adversely affect our business 

in some cases we may expend a significant amount of resources and management attention on offerings that do not ultimately succeed in their markets we have encountered difficulty in launching new products and services in the past if we misjudge customer needs in the future our new products and services may not succeed and our revenues and earnings may be harmed we have also invested and in the future expect to invest in new business models geographies strategies and initiatives such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties including distraction of management from current operations

as we continue to transition our business to more connected services we become more dependent on the continuing operation and availability of our information technology and communication systems and those of our external service providers including for example third party internetbased or cloud computing services we do not have redundancy for all of our systems many of our critical applications reside in only one of our data centers and our disaster recovery planning may not account for all eventualities we also do not maintain realtime backup of all our data and in the event of significant system disruption we may experience loss of data or processing capabilities which may cause us to lose customers and may materially harm our reputation and our operating results in addition we are in the process of updating our customer facing applications and the supporting information technology infrastructure to meet our customers’ expectations for continuous service availability any difficulties in upgrading these applications or infrastructure or failure of our systems or those of our thirdparty service providers may result in interruptions in our service which may reduce our revenues and profits cause us to lose customers and damage our reputation any prolonged interruptions at any time may result in lost customers additional refunds of customer charges negative publicity and increased operating costs any of which may significantly harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are in the process of migrating our applications and infrastructure to new data centers and to third party hosted environments if we do not execute the transition to these new environments in an effective manner we may experience unplanned service disruptions or unforeseen increases in costs which may harm our operating results and our business 

our business operations data centers information technology and communications systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters human error malicious attacks fire power loss telecommunications failures computer viruses computer denial of service attacks terrorist attacks and other events beyond our control the majority of our research and development activities our corporate headquarters our principal information technology systems and other critical business operations are located near major seismic faults we do not carry earthquake insurance for direct quakerelated losses our future financial results may be materially harmed in the event of a major earthquake or other natural or manmade disaster 

we rely on internal systems and external systems maintained by manufacturers distributors and other service providers to take and fulfill customer orders handle customer service requests and host certain online activities any interruption or failure of our internal or external systems may prevent us or our service providers from accepting and fulfilling customer orders or cause company and customer data to be unintentionally disclosed our continuing efforts to upgrade and expand our network security and other information systems as well as our highavailability capabilities may be costly and problems with the design or implementation of system enhancements may harm our business and our results of operations 

we host collect use and retain sensitive and personal customer information and data a security breach resulting in third party access to this information and data could materially disrupt our businesses result in the disclosure of confidential information significantly damage our reputation and cause material losses 

we host collect use and retain large amounts of sensitive and personal customer information and data including credit card numbers tax return information bank account numbers and passwords personal and business financial data and transactions social security numbers healthcare information and payroll information in addition we collect and maintain sensitive and personal information of our employees in the ordinary course of our business the volume of sensitive and personal information that we collect has been increasing and will continue to increase as we further transition our businesses to connected services we and our vendors use commercially available security technologies to protect this information and data and we also use security and business controls to limit access to and use of such sensitive and personal customer information and data however a major breach of our security measures or those of third parties that provide hosting services or have access to our sensitive and personal customer information may have serious negative consequences for our businesses including possible fines penalties and damages reduced customer demand for our services material harm to our reputation and brands further regulation and oversight by federal or state agencies and loss of our ability to provide financial transaction services or accept and process customer credit card orders or tax returns 

from time to time we detect or receive notices from customers or public or private agencies that they have detected vulnerabilities in our servers our software or thirdparty software components that are distributed with our products the existence of vulnerabilities even if they do not result in a security breach may harm customer confidence and require substantial resources to address and we may not be able to discover or remediate such security vulnerabilities before they are

exploited in addition our technologies systems and networks and our customers devices have been subject to and are likely to continue to be the target of cyber attacks computer viruses worms phishing attacks malicious software programs and other information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release gathering monitoring misuse loss or destruction of our customers sensitive and personal information and data or otherwise disrupt our or our customers or other third parties business operations although this is an industrywide problem that affects software across platforms it is increasingly affecting our offerings because cybercriminals tend to focus their efforts on wellknown offerings that are popular among customers and we expect them to continue to do so if these cybercriminals are able to circumvent our security measures or if we are unable to detect an intrusion into our systems and contain such intrusion in a reasonable amount of time our customers sensitive and personal information and data may be compromised 

in addition our employees contractors temporary and seasonal employees may have access to sensitive and personal information of our customers and employees while we conduct background checks of our employees and these other individuals and limit access to systems and data it is possible that one or more of these individuals may circumvent these controls resulting in a security breach in addition we rely on third party vendors to host certain of our sensitive and personal information and data while we conduct due diligence on these third party parters with respect to their security and business controls we may not not have the ability to effectively monitor or oversee the implementation of these controls measures and in any event individuals or third parties may be able to circumvent andor exploit vulnerabilities that may exist in these security and business controls resulting in a loss of sensitive and personal customer or employee information and data 

if we are unable to develop manage and maintain critical third party business relationships our business may be adversely affected 

our growth is dependent on the strength of our business relationships and our ability to continue to develop maintain and leverage new and existing relationships we rely on various third party partners including software and service providers suppliers vendors manufacturers distributors contractors financial institutions core processors licensing partners and development partners among others in many areas of our business in order to deliver our offerings and operate our business we also rely on third parties to support the operation of our business by maintaining our physical facilities equipment power systems and infrastructure in certain instances these third party relationships are sole source or limited source relationships and can be difficult to replace or substitute depending on the level of integration of the third party’s products or services into or with our offerings andor the general availability of such third party’s products and services in addition there may be few or no alternative third party providers or vendors in the market further there can be no assurance that we will be able to adequately retain third party contractors engaged to help us operate our business the failure of third parties to provide acceptable and high quality products services and technologies or to update their products services and technologies may result in a disruption to our business operations and our customers which may reduce our revenues and profits cause us to lose customers and damage our reputation alternative arrangements and services may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or we may experience business interruptions upon a transition to an alternative partner 

in particular we have relationships with banks credit unions and other financial institutions that support certain critical services we offer to our customers if macroeconomic conditions or other factors cause any of these institutions to fail consolidate stop providing certain services or institute costcutting efforts our business and financial results may suffer and we may be unable to offer those services to our customers 

we have also started to increasingly utilize the distribution platforms of third parties like apples app store and googles play store for the distribution of certain of our product offerings although we benefit from the strong brand recognition and large user base of these distribution platforms to attract new customers the platform owners have wide discretion to change the pricing structure terms of service and other policies with respect to us and other developers any adverse changes by these third parties could adversely affect our financial results     

increased government regulation of our businesses may harm our operating results 

many of our businesses are regulated under federal state and local laws including our tax accounting professionals payroll and payments businesses there have been significant new regulations and heightened focus by the government on many of these areas as well as in areas such as insurance and healthcare including for example the affordable care act and the collection use and security of user data a s we expand our products and services and revise our business models both domestically and internationally we may become subject to additional government regulation or increased regulatory scrutiny further regulators may adopt new laws or regulations or their interpretation of existing laws or regulations may differ from ours as well as the laws of other jurisdictions in which we operate these regulatory requirements could impose significant limitations require changes to our business require notification to customers or employees of a security breach restrict our use of personal information or cause changes in customer purchasing behavior which may make our business more costly less

efficient or impossible to conduct and may require us to modify our current or future products or services which may harm our future financial results in particular as our business continues to expand to new industry segments that may be more highly regulated for privacy and data security and to countries outside the united states that have more strict data protection laws our compliance requirements and costs may increase we have incurred – and may continue to incur – significant expenses to comply with mandatory privacy and security standards and protocols imposed by law regulation industry standards or contractual obligations 

the tax preparation industry continues to receive heightened attention from federal and state governments new legislation regulation public policy considerations litigation by the government or private entities or new interpretations of existing laws may result in greater oversight of the tax preparation industry restrict the types of products and services that we can offer or the prices we can charge or otherwise cause us to change the way we operate our tax businesses or offer our tax products and services we may not be able to respond quickly to such regulatory legislative and other developments and these changes may in turn increase our cost of doing business and limit our revenue opportunities in addition if our practices are not consistent with new interpretations of existing laws we may become subject to lawsuits penalties and other liabilities that did not previously apply we are also required to comply with a variety of state revenue agency standards in order to successfully operate our tax preparation and electronic filing services changes in stateimposed requirements by one or more of the states including the required use of specific technologies or technology standards may significantly increase the costs of providing those services to our customers and may prevent us from delivering a quality product to our customers in a timely manner 

if we fail to process transactions effectively or fail to adequately protect against disputed or potential fraudulent activities our revenue and earnings may be harmed 

our operations process a significant volume and dollar value of transactions on a daily basis especially in our payroll and payments businesses due to the size and volume of transactions that we handle effective processing systems and controls are essential to ensure that transactions are handled appropriately despite our efforts it is possible that we may make errors or that funds may be misappropriated due to fraud the systems supporting our business are comprised of multiple technology platforms that are difficult to scale if we are unable to effectively manage our systems and processes we may be unable to process customer data in an accurate reliable and timely manner which may harm our business in our payments processing service business if merchants for whom we process payment transactions are unable to pay refunds due to their customers in connection with disputed or fraudulent merchant transactions we may be required to pay those amounts and our payments may exceed the amount of the customer reserves we have established to make such payments 

the online tax preparation payroll administration and online payments industries have been experiencing an increasing amount of fraudulent activities by third parties although we do not believe that any of this activity is uniquely targeted at our business this type of fraudulent activity may adversely impact our own operations in our consumer tax payroll and payments businesses in addition to any direct damages and potential fines that may result from such fraud which may be substantial a loss of confidence in our controls may seriously harm our business and damage our brand as fraud detection and prevention abilities improve across the various industries in which we operate we may implement risk control mechanisms that could make it more difficult for legitimate customers to obtain and use our products as well as prevent the sale of our products to those parties seeking to facilitate fraudulent activity which could result in lost revenue and negatively impact our operating results 

  

third parties claiming that we infringe their proprietary rights may cause us to incur significant legal expenses and prevent us from selling our products 

we may become increasingly subject to infringement claims including patent copyright trade secret and trademark infringement claims litigation may be necessary to determine the validity and scope of the intellectual property rights of others we have received a number of allegations of intellectual property infringement claims in the past and expect to receive more claims in the future based on allegations that our offerings infringe upon the intellectual property held by third parties some of these claims are the subject of pending litigation against us and against some of our customers these claims may involve patent holding companies or other adverse intellectual property owners who have no relevant product revenues of their own and against whom our own intellectual property may provide little or no deterrence the ultimate outcome of any allegation is uncertain and regardless of outcome any such claim with or without merit may be time consuming to defend result in costly litigation divert management’s time and attention from our business require us to stop selling delay shipping or redesign our products or require us to pay monetary damages for royalty or licensing fees or to satisfy indemnification obligations that we have with some of our customers our failure to obtain necessary license or other rights or litigation arising out of intellectual property claims may harm our business

we rely on third party intellectual property in our products and services 

many of our products and services include intellectual property of third parties which we license under agreements that may need to be renewed or renegotiated from time to time we may not be able to obtain licenses to these third party technologies or content on reasonable terms or at all if we are unable to obtain the rights necessary to use this intellectual property in our products and services we may not be able to sell the affected offerings and customers who are currently using the affected product may be disrupted which may in turn harm our future financial results damage our brand and result in customer loss also we and our customers have been and may continue to be subject to infringement claims as a result of the third party intellectual property incorporated in to our offerings although we try to mitigate this risk and we may not be ultimately liable for any potential infringement pending claims require us to use significant resources require management attention and could result in loss of customers 

some of our offerings include thirdparty software that is licensed under socalled “open source” licenses some of which may include a requirement that under certain circumstances we make available or grant licenses to any modifications or derivative works we create based upon the open source software although we have established internal review and approval processes to mitigate these risks we may not be sure that all open source software is submitted for approval prior to use in our products many of the risks associated with usage of open source may not be eliminated and may if not properly addressed harm our business 

our intellectual property rights are valuable and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products services and brand 

our patents trademarks trade secrets copyrights and other intellectual property rights are important assets for us we aggressively protect our intellectual property rights by relying on federal state and common law rights in the us and internationally as well as a variety of administrative procedures we also rely on contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary rights in products and services the efforts that we take to protect our proprietary rights may not always be sufficient or effective protecting our intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming and may not be successful in every location any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business our brand and our ability to compete 

policing unauthorized use and copying of our products is difficult expensive and time consuming current us laws that prohibit copying give us only limited practical protection from software piracy and the laws of many other countries provide very little protection we frequently encounter unauthorized copies of our software being sold through online marketplaces although we continue to evaluate and put in place technology solutions to attempt to lessen the impact of piracy and engage in efforts to educate consumers and public policy leaders on these issues and cooperate with industry groups in their efforts to combat piracy we expect piracy to be a persistent problem that results in lost revenues and increased expenses 

because competition for our key employees is intense we may not be able to attract retain and develop the highly skilled employees we need to support our planned growth 

much of our future success depends on the continued service and availability of skilled personnel including members of our executive team and those in technical marketing and staff positions experienced personnel in the software mobile technologies data science data security and software as a service industries are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense especially in california and india where the majority of our employees are located also as we strive to continue to adapt to technological change and introduce new and enhanced products and business models we must be able to secure maintain and develop the right quality and quantity of engaged and committed talent although we strive to be an employer of choice we may not be able to continue to successfully attract retain and develop key personnel which may cause our business to suffer 

as our product and service offerings become more tightly integrated we may be required to recognize the related revenue over relatively longer periods of time 

our expanding range of products and services and the combinations in which we offer them generate different revenue streams than our traditional desktop software businesses and the accounting policies that apply to revenue from these offerings are complex for example as we offer more online services bundled with software products we may be required to defer a higher percentage of our software product revenue into future fiscal periods in addition as we offer more services on a subscription basis we recognize revenue from those services over the periods in which the services are provided this may result in significant shifts of revenue from quarter to quarter or from one fiscal year to the next

the nature of our products and services necessitates timely product launches and if we experience significant product quality problems or delays it may harm our revenue earnings and reputation 

all of our tax products and many of our nontax products have rigid development timetables that increase the risk of errors in our products and the risk of launch delays our tax preparation software product development cycle is particularly challenging due to the need to incorporate unpredictable tax law and tax form changes each year and because our customers expect high levels of accuracy and a timely launch of these products to prepare and file their taxes by the tax filing deadline due to the complexity of our products and the condensed development cycles under which we operate our products sometimes contain glitches that may unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the software the complexity of our products may also make it difficult for us to consistently deliver offerings that contain the features functionality and level of accuracy that our customers expect when we encounter problems we may be required to modify our code distribute patches to customers who have already purchased the product and recall or repackage existing product inventory in our distribution channels if we encounter development challenges or discover errors in our products late in our development cycle it may cause us to delay our product launch date any major defects or launch delays may lead to loss of customers and revenue negative publicity customer and employee dissatisfaction reduced retailer shelf space and promotions and increased operating expenses such as inventory replacement costs legal fees or payments resulting from our commitment to reimburse penalties and interest paid by customers due solely to calculation errors in our consumer tax preparation products 

our businesses are highly seasonal and our quarterly results could fluctuate significantly 

historically several of our businesses have been highly seasonal and this has caused significant fluctuations in our quarterly financial results due to the timing of annual product releases revenue from our quickbooks desktop software products has tended to be highest during our second and third fiscal quarters sales of income tax preparation products and services are heavily concentrated from november through april these seasonal patterns mean that our total revenue is usually highest during the second and third fiscal quarters ending january 31 and april 30 we typically experience lower revenues and operating losses in the first and fourth fiscal quarters ending october 31 and july 31 although in the longer term we expect the seasonality of certain of our businesses to diminish due to our decision to deliver ongoing releases for our future desktop offerings and due to increasing customer preference for online and subscription versions of our offerings we expect the seasonality of certain other businesses particularly our consumer tax business to continue in the near term we expect the seasonality of our overall business to continue our financial results may also fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year due to a variety of factors including factors that may affect the timing of revenue recognition these include changes to our offerings that result in the inclusion or exclusion of ongoing services changes in product pricing strategies or product sales mix the timing of the availability of federal and state tax forms from taxing agencies and the ability of those agencies to receive electronic tax return submissions changes in consumer behavior and the timing of our discontinuation of support for older product offerings other factors that may affect our quarterly or annual financial results include the timing of acquisitions divestitures and goodwill and acquired intangible asset impairment charges any fluctuations in our operating results may adversely affect our stock price 

we are frequently a party to litigation and regulatory inquiries which could result in an unfavorable outcome and have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operation and cash flows 

we are subject to various legal proceedings claims and regulatory inquiries that have arisen out of the ordinary conduct of our business and are not yet resolved and additional claims and inquiries may arise in the future the number and significance of these claims and inquiries have increased as our businesses have evolved any proceedings claims or inquiries initiated by or against us whether successful or not may be time consuming result in costly litigation damage awards consent decrees injunctive relief or increased costs of business require us to change our business practices or products require significant amounts of management time result in diversion of significant operations resources or otherwise harm our business and future financial results 

adverse global economic conditions could harm our business and financial condition 

the onset or continuation of adverse macroeconomic developments could negatively affect our business and financial condition adverse global economic events have caused and could in the future cause disruptions and volatility in global financial markets and increased rates of default and bankruptcy and could impact consumer and small business spending in particular because the majority of our revenue is derived from sales within the us economic conditions in the us have an even greater impact on us than companies with a more diverse international presence challenging economic times could cause potential new customers not to purchase or to delay purchasing of our products and services and could cause our existing customers to discontinue purchasing or delay upgrades of our existing products and services thereby negatively impacting our revenues and future financial results decreased consumer spending levels could also reduce credit and debit card transaction processing volumes causing reductions in our payments revenue poor economic conditions and high unemployment have 

 21

caused and could in the future cause a significant decrease in the number of tax returns filed which may have a significant effect on the number of tax returns we prepare and file in addition weakness in the enduser consumer and small business markets could negatively affect the cash flow of our distributors and resellers who could in turn delay paying their obligations to us which could increase our credit risk exposure and cause delays in our recognition of revenue or future sales to these customers any of these events could harm our business and our future financial results 

we regularly invest resources to update and improve our internal information technology systems and software platforms should our investments not succeed or if delays or other issues with new or existing internal technology systems and software platforms disrupt our operations our business could be harmed 

we rely on our network and data center infrastructure and internal technology systems for many of our development marketing operational support sales accounting and financial reporting activities we are continually investing resources to update and improve these systems and environments in order to meet existing as well as the growing and changing requirements of our business and customers if we experience prolonged delays or unforeseen difficulties in updating and upgrading our systems and architecture we may experience outages and may not be able to deliver certain offerings and develop new offerings and enhancements that we need to remain competitive such improvements and upgrades are often complex costly and time consuming in addition such improvements can be challenging to integrate with our existing technology systems or may uncover problems with our existing technology systems unsuccessful implementation of hardware or software updates and improvements could result in outages disruption in our business operations loss of revenue or damage to our reputation 

our international operations are subject to increased risks which may harm our business operating results and financial condition 

in addition to uncertainty about our ability to generate revenues from our foreign operations and expand into international markets there are risks inherent in doing business internationally including 

 

violations of the complex foreign and us laws and regulations that apply to our international operations may result in fines criminal actions or sanctions against us our officers or our employees prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with these laws there can be no assurance that our employees contractors or agents will not violate our policies these risks inherent in our international operations and expansion increase our costs of doing business internationally and may result in harm to our business operating results and financial condition

if actual product returns exceed returns reserves our future financial results may be harmed 

we ship more desktop software products to our distributors and retailers than we expect them to sell in order to reduce the risk that distributors or retailers may run out of products this is particularly true for our consumer tax products which have a short selling season and for which returns occur primarily in our fiscal third and fourth quarters like many software companies that sell their products through distributors and retailers we have historically accepted significant product returns we establish reserves against revenue for product returns in our financial statements based on estimated returns and we closely monitor product sales and inventory in the retail channel in an effort to maintain adequate reserves in the past returns have not differed significantly from these reserves however if we experience actual returns that significantly exceed reserves it may result in lower net revenue 

unanticipated changes in our income tax rates may affect our future financial results 

our future effective income tax rates may be favorably or unfavorably affected by unanticipated changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or by changes in tax laws or their interpretation in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes these continuous examinations may result in unforeseen taxrelated liabilities which may harm our future financial results 

amortization of acquired intangible assets and impairment charges may cause significant fluctuation in our net income 

our acquisitions have resulted in significant expenses including amortization and impairment of acquired technology and other acquired intangible assets and impairment of goodwill total costs and expenses in these categories were approximately 46 million in fiscal 2014  99 million in fiscal 2013  and 33 million in fiscal 2012  although under current accounting rules goodwill is not amortized we may incur impairment charges related to the goodwill already recorded and to goodwill arising out of future acquisitions we test the impairment of goodwill annually in our fourth fiscal quarter or more frequently if indicators of impairment arise the timing of the formal annual test may result in charges to our statement of operations in our fourth fiscal quarter that may not have been reasonably foreseen in prior periods the total costs and expenses for fiscal 2013 included a goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges of 46 million that reduced the carrying value of our intuit health goodwill and intangible assets to zero we completed the sale of that business in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 at july 31 2014  we had 16 billion  in goodwill and 199  million in net acquired intangible assets on our balance sheet both of which may be subject to impairment charges in the future new acquisitions and any impairment of the value of acquired intangible assets may have a significant negative impact on our future financial results 

our acquisition and divestiture activities may disrupt our ongoing business may involve increased expenses and may present risks not contemplated at the time of the transactions 

we have acquired and may continue to acquire companies products and technologies that complement our strategic direction acquisitions involve significant risks and uncertainties including

tables of contents 

we have divested and may in the future divest certain assets or businesses that no longer fit with our strategic direction or growth targets divestitures involve significant risks and uncertainties including 

 

because acquisitions and divestitures are inherently risky our transactions may not be successful and may in some cases harm our operating results or financial condition although we typically fund our acquisitions through cash available from operations if we were to use debt to fund acquisitions or for other purposes our interest expense and leverage would increase significantly and if we were to issue equity securities as consideration in an acquisition current shareholders’ percentage ownership and earnings per share would be diluted 

we have 500 million in debt outstanding and may incur other debt in the future which may adversely affect our financial condition and future financial results 

in fiscal 2007 we issued 500 million in senior unsecured notes due in march 2012 and 500 million in senior unsecured notes due in march 2017 we repaid the march 2012 notes when they became due using cash from operations as the march 2017 debt matures we will have to expend significant resources to either repay or refinance these notes if we decide to refinance the notes we may be required to do so on different or less favorable terms or we may be unable to refinance the notes at all both of which may adversely affect our financial condition 

we have also entered into a 500 million fiveyear revolving credit facility although we have no current plans to request any advances under this credit facility we may use the proceeds of any future borrowing for general corporate purposes including future acquisitions 

this debt may adversely affect our financial condition and future financial results by among other things 

 

our current revolving credit facility imposes restrictions on us including restrictions on our ability to create liens on our assets and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur indebtedness and require us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios our ability to comply with these ratios may be affected by events beyond our control in addition our short and longterm debt includes covenants that may adversely affect our ability to incur certain liens or engage in certain types of sale and leaseback transactions if we breach any of the covenants under our short and longterm debt or our revolving credit facility and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders then subject to applicable cure periods any outstanding indebtedness may be declared immediately due and payable

in addition changes by any rating agency to our credit rating may negatively impact the value and liquidity of both our debt and equity securities if our credit ratings are downgraded or other negative action is taken the interest rate payable by us under our revolving credit facility may increase in addition any downgrades in our credit ratings may affect our ability to obtain additional financing in the future and may affect the terms of any such financing 

we are subject to risks associated with information disseminated through our services 

the laws relating to the liability of online services companies for information such as online content disseminated through their services are subject to frequent challenges in spite of settled law in the us claims are made against online services companies by parties who disagree with the content where our online content is accessed on the internet outside of the us challenges may be brought under foreign laws which do not provide the same protections for online services companies as in the us these challenges in either us or foreign jurisdictions may rise to legal claims alleging defamation libel invasion of privacy negligence copyright or trademark infringement or other theories based on the nature and content of the materials disseminated through the services certain of our services include content generated by users of our online services although this content is not generated by us claims of defamation or other injury may be made against us for that content any costs incurred as a result of this potential liability may harm our business 

our stock price may be volatile and your investment could lose value 

our stock price is subject to changes in recommendations or earnings estimates by financial analysts changes in investors or analysts valuation measures for our stock our credit ratings and market trends unrelated to our performance furthermore speculation in the press or investment community about our strategic position financial condition results of operations business or security of our products can cause changes in our stock price these factors as well as general economic and political conditions and the timing of announcements in the public market regarding new products product enhancements or technological advances by our competitors or us and any announcements by us of acquisitions major transactions or management changes may adversely affect our stock price further any changes in the amounts or frequency of share repurchases or dividends may also adversely affect our stock price a significant drop in our stock price could expose us to the risk of securities class actions lawsuits which may result in substantial costs and divert managements attention and resources which may adversely affect our business 

our business depends on our strong reputation and the value of our brands 

developing and maintaining awareness of our brands is critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our existing and future products and services and is an important element in attracting new customers adverse publicity whether or not justified relating to events or activities attributed to us our employees or agents may tarnish our reputation and reduce the value of our brands damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity may reduce demand for our products and services and thus have an adverse effect on our future financial results as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of the brands

you should note that this mda discussion contains forwardlooking statements that involve risks and uncertainties please see the section entitled “forwardlooking statements and risk factors”  at the beginning of item 1a for important information to consider when evaluating such statements 

you should read this mda in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes in item 8 of this annual report in fiscal 2014 we acquired check inc and in fiscal 2012 we acquired demandforce inc we have included their results of operations in our consolidated results of operations from the dates of acquisition 

in fiscal 2013 we completed the sale of our intuit websites business and in fiscal 2014 we completed the sales of our intuit financial services ifs and intuit health businesses we accounted for all of these businesses as discontinued operations and have therefore reclassified our statements of operations for all periods presented to reflect them as such we have also reclassified our balance sheets for all periods presented to reflect ifs as discontinued operations the net assets of intuit websites and intuit health were not significant so we have not reclassified our balance sheets for any period presented to reflect them as discontinued operations because the cash flows of our intuit websites ifs and intuit health discontinued operations were not material for any period presented we have not segregated the cash flows of those businesses from continuing operations on our statements of cash flows see “results of operations – nonoperating income and expense – discontinued operations”  later in this item 7 for more information unless otherwise noted the following discussion pertains to our continuing operations 

executive overview 

this overview provides a high level discussion of our operating results and some of the trends that affect our business we believe that an understanding of these trends is important in order to understand our financial results for fiscal 2014  as well as our future prospects this summary is not intended to be exhaustive nor is it intended to be a substitute for the detailed discussion and analysis provided elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k

industry trends and seasonality 

the industry in which we operate is dynamic and highly competitive and we expect it to remain so in the future the markets for software and related services especially highlyavailable connected services are characterized by rapid technological change shifting customer needs and frequent new product introductions and enhancements competitive interest and expertise in many of the markets we serve have grown markedly over the past few years and we expect this trend to continue there are also large cloudbased service companies who innovate quickly and serve small businesses and consumers while today our competition with such companies may be limited as we and those companies grow our competition with them may increase in recent years the widespread availability of the internet the emergence of mobile devices and the explosion of social media have accelerated the pace of change and revolutionized the way that people throughout the world manage important financial tasks the result is a global market that is shifting from traditional services that are paperbased humanproduced and brickandmortar bound to one where people understand demand and embrace the benefits of connected services this trend toward connected services is the primary driver of the strategies in all of our businesses 

historically our quickbooks consumer tax and professional tax offerings have been highly seasonal revenue from our quickbooks software products have tended to be highest during our second and third fiscal quarters sales of income tax preparation products and services are heavily concentrated from november through april in our consumer tax business a greater proportion of our revenue has shifted to later in this seasonal period due in part to the growth in sales of turbotax online for which we recognize revenue when tax returns are printed or electronically filed the seasonality of our consumer tax and professional tax revenue is also affected by the timing of the availability of tax forms from taxing agencies and the ability of those agencies to receive electronic tax return submissions delays in the availability of tax forms or the ability of taxing agencies to receive submissions can cause revenue to shift between our fiscal quarters these seasonal patterns mean that our total net revenue is usually highest during our second quarter ending january 31 and third quarter ending april 30 we typically report losses in our first quarter ending october 31 and fourth quarter ending july 31 during these quarters revenue from our tax businesses is minimal while core operating expenses such as research and development continue at relatively consistent levels 

in august 2014 we announced that we will begin delivering ongoing releases for our future desktop offerings in order to improve the product experience accommodate operating system updates and provide access to connected services we believe that providing more frequent releases will create a better experience for customers who choose our desktop offerings as well as a more seamless transition to our online offerings in the future this decision will affect the timing of revenue recognition for future sales of our quickbooks and quicken desktop products where revenue will be recognized over approximately three years and our professional tax solutions where more revenue will be recognized later in the tax year as a result of this decision in fiscal 2015 we expect to defer approximately 400 million in revenue to future periods we expect the seasonality of our small business and professional tax offerings to be partially mitigated by this change beginning in fiscal 2015 

key challenges and risks 

our growth strategy depends upon our ability to initiate and embrace disruptive technology trends to enter new markets and to drive broad adoption of the products and services we develop and market our future growth also increasingly depends on the strength of our thirdparty business relationships and our ability to continue to develop maintain and strengthen new and existing relationships to remain competitive and continue to grow we are investing significant resources in our product development marketing and sales capabilities and we expect to continue to do so in the future 

as we continue transitioning to offer more connected services the ongoing operation and availability of our information technology and communication systems and those of our external service providers is becoming increasingly important because we help customers manage their financial lives we face risks associated with the hosting collection use and retention of personal customer information and data we are investing significant management attention and resources in our information technology infrastructure and in our privacy and security capabilities and we expect to continue to do so in the future 

for a complete discussion of the most significant risks and uncertainties affecting our business please see “forwardlooking statements and risk factors”  in item 1a of this report 

overview of financial results 

the most important financial indicators that we use to assess our business are revenue growth for the company as a whole for each reportable segment and for product lines within each reportable segment operating income growth and operating income margins for the company as a whole and for each reportable segment earnings per share and cash flow from operations we also track certain nonfinancial drivers of revenue growth and when material identify them in the applicable discussions of segment results below these nonfinancial drivers include for example customer growth and retention for all of our

businesses annualized recurring revenue arr for our small business online ecosystem and transaction volume for our payment processing business we define arr as four times the most recent fiscal quarter revenue for our online small business offerings including quickbooks online online payroll online payments demandforce and quickbase total credit and debit card transaction volume correlates strongly with the macroeconomic environment and is one of the key drivers of revenue growth in our payment processing business customers for our connected services offerings have generally grown faster than those for our traditional desktop software offerings reflecting our strategic focus on connected services over the past few years connected services generated 30 billion or 66 of our total revenue in fiscal 2014  compared with 50 of our total revenue six years ago we expect connected services revenue as a percentage of our total revenue to continue to grow in the future 

total net revenue for fiscal 2014  was 45 billion  an increase of 8  compared with fiscal 2013  our small business and consumer segments were the key drivers of revenue growth revenue in our small business segment increased 10  compared with fiscal 2013  due to growth in connected services offerings revenue in our consumer segment increased 7  compared with fiscal 2013  due to 10 growth in paid federal turbotax units partially offset by changes in product mix 

operating income from continuing operations increased 7  in fiscal 2014  compared with fiscal 2013  due to higher revenue partially offset by higher costs and expenses operating expenses were higher due to increases in staffing expenses and to a lesser extent to increases in expenses for marketing programs and sharebased compensation net income from continuing operations increased 5  in fiscal 2014  compared with fiscal 2013  due to the increase in operating income and a gain on the sale of an equity investment partially offset by a higher effective tax rate in the fiscal 2014  period diluted net income per share from continuing operations for fiscal 2014  increased 9  to 296  as a result of the increase in net income and the decline in weighted average diluted common shares compared with fiscal 2013  

we ended fiscal 2014  with cash cash equivalents and investments totaling 19 billion  in fiscal 2014  we generated cash from operations from the sale of our intuit financial services business and to a lesser extent from the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans during the same period we used cash for the repurchase of shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs acquisitions of businesses the payment of cash dividends and capital expenditures at july 31 2014  we had authorization from our board of directors to expend up to an additional 19 billion for stock repurchases through august 19 2017 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

in preparing our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap we are required to make estimates assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on our net revenue operating income or loss and net income or loss as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our balance sheet we believe that the estimates assumptions and judgments involved in the following accounting policies have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies 

 

our senior management has reviewed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and their disclosure in this annual report on form 10k with the audit and risk committee of our board of directors 

revenue recognition 

we derive revenue from the sale of software subscriptions hosted services packaged software products financial supplies technical support plans transaction fees merchant services hardware and multiple element arrangements that may include a combination of these items we follow the appropriate revenue recognition rules for each type of revenue for additional information see “revenue recognition”  in note 1 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report we generally recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists we have delivered the product or performed the service the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable however determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves exercising judgment and using estimates that can have a significant impact on the timing and

tables of contents 

amount of revenue we report for example for multiple element arrangements containing only software and softwarerelated elements we must exercise judgment and use estimates in order to 1 allocate the total price among the various elements we must deliver 2 determine whether undelivered services are essential to the functionality of the delivered products and services 3 determine whether vendorspecific evidence of fair value exists for each undelivered element and 4 determine whether and when each element has been delivered for multiple element arrangements containing nonsoftware elements we must exercise judgment and use estimates in order to 1 determine whether and when each element has been delivered 2 determine the fair value of each element using the selling price hierarchy of vendorspecific evidence vsoe of fair value if available thirdparty evidence tpe if vsoe is not available and estimated selling price esp if neither vsoe nor tpe is available and 3 allocate the total price among the various elements based on the relative selling price method if we were to change any of these judgments or estimates it could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period amounts for fees collected or invoiced and due relating to arrangements where revenue cannot be recognized are reflected on our balance sheet as deferred revenue and recognized when the applicable revenue recognition criteria are satisfied 

in connection with the sale of certain products we provide a limited amount of free technical support assistance to customers we do not defer the recognition of any revenue associated with sales of these products since the cost of providing this free technical support is insignificant the technical support is generally provided within one year after the associated revenue is recognized and free product enhancements are minimal and infrequent we accrue the estimated cost of providing this free support upon product shipment 

business combinations 

as described in “description of business and summary of significant accounting policies — business combinations”  in note 1 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report under the acquisition method of accounting we generally recognize the identifiable assets acquired the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interests in an acquiree at their fair values as of the date of acquisition we measure goodwill as the excess of consideration transferred which we also measure at fair value over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed the acquisition method of accounting requires us to exercise judgment and make significant estimates and assumptions regarding the fair values of the elements of a business combination as of the date of acquisition including the fair values of identifiable intangible assets deferred tax asset valuation allowances liabilities related to uncertain tax positions and contingencies this method also requires us to refine these estimates over a oneyear measurement period to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that if known would have affected the measurement of the amounts recognized as of that date if we are required to retroactively adjust provisional amounts that we have recorded for the fair values of assets and liabilities in connection with acquisitions these adjustments could materially decrease our operating income and net income and result in lower asset values on our balance sheet 

significant estimates and assumptions that we must make in estimating the fair value of acquired technology customer lists and other identifiable intangible assets include future cash flows that we expect to generate from the acquired assets if the subsequent actual results and updated projections of the underlying business activity change compared with the assumptions and projections used to develop these values we could record impairment charges in addition we have estimated the economic lives of certain acquired assets and these lives are used to calculate depreciation and amortization expense if our estimates of the economic lives change depreciation or amortization expenses could be accelerated or slowed 

goodwill acquired intangible assets and other longlived assets – impairment assessments 

we estimate the fair value of acquired intangible assets and other longlived assets that have finite useful lives whenever an event or change in circumstances indicates that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable we test for potential impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives annually in our fourth fiscal quarter or whenever indicators of impairment arise the timing of the annual test may result in charges to our statement of operations in our fourth fiscal quarter that could not have been reasonably foreseen in prior periods 

as described in “description of business and summary of significant accounting policies – goodwill acquired intangible assets and other longlived assets”  in note 1 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report in order to estimate the fair value of goodwill we use a weighted combination of a discounted cash flow model known as the income approach and comparisons to publicly traded companies engaged in similar businesses known as the market approach the income approach requires us to use a number of assumptions including market factors specific to the business the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows to be generated by the business over an extended period of time longterm growth rates for the business and a rate of return that considers the relative risk of achieving the cash flows and the time value of money we evaluate cash flows at the reporting unit level although the assumptions we use in our discounted cash flow model are 

 34 

tables of contents 

consistent with the assumptions we use to generate our internal strategic plans and forecasts significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of future cash flows from each reporting unit and the relative risk of achieving those cash flows when using the market approach we make judgments about the comparability of publicly traded companies engaged in similar businesses we base our judgments on factors such as size growth rates profitability risk and return on investment we also make judgments when adjusting market multiples of revenue operating income and earnings for these companies to reflect their relative similarity to our own businesses we had a total of 16 billion  in goodwill on our balance sheet at july 31 2014  see note 5 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report for a summary of goodwill by reportable segment 

we estimate the recoverability of acquired intangible assets and other longlived assets that have finite useful lives by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows that we expect the asset to generate in order to estimate the fair value of those assets we estimate the present value of future cash flows from those assets the key assumptions that we use in our discounted cash flow model are the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows to be generated by the asset over an extended period of time and a rate of return that considers the relative risk of achieving the cash flows and the time value of money significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of future cash flows and the relative risk of achieving those cash flows we also make judgments about the remaining useful lives of acquired intangible assets and other longlived assets that have finite lives we had a total of  199 million  in net acquired intangible assets on our balance sheet at july 31 2014  

assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives are complex and often subjective they can be affected by a variety of factors including external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts for example if our future operating results do not meet current forecasts or if we experience a sustained decline in our market capitalization that is determined to be indicative of a reduction in fair value of one or more of our reporting units we may be required to record future impairment charges for goodwill and acquired intangible assets impairment charges could materially decrease our future net income and result in lower asset values on our balance sheet 

during the fourth quarters of fiscal 2014  fiscal 2013  and fiscal 2012  we performed our annual goodwill impairment tests using the methodology described in “description of business and summary of significant accounting policies – goodwill acquired intangible assets and other longlived assets”  in note 1 to the financial statements in part 8 of this annual report we determined that the estimated fair values of all of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values and that they were not impaired in addition during this analysis we concluded that the estimated fair values of all of our reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying values 

in march 2013 the largest customer for our intuit health business acquired a company that offered similar solutions and competed with us directly in that market space as a result we performed an interim impairment test of goodwill and acquired intangible assets during the third quarter of fiscal 2013 we concluded that the carrying amounts of goodwill and certain definitelived acquired intangible assets associated with our intuit health business were impaired and recorded an impairment charge of approximately 46 million that reduced the carrying value of those assets to zero see “ fair value measurements – assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis”  in note 2 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report for more information in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 management approved a plan to sell our intuit health business and we accounted for it as discontinued operations in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 we completed the sale for cash consideration that was not significant intuit health was part of our former other businesses reportable segment 

accounting for sharebased compensation plans 

at july 31 2014  there was 455  million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested sharebased compensation arrangements granted under all equity compensation plans which we will amortize to expense in the future total unrecognized compensation cost will be adjusted for future changes in estimated forfeitures we expect to recognize that cost over a weighted average vesting period of 24  years 

we use a lattice binomial model and the assumptions described in note 11 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report to estimate the fair value of stock options granted we estimate the expected term of options granted based on implied exercise patterns using a binomial model we estimate the volatility of our common stock at the date of grant based on the implied volatility of publicly traded oneyear and twoyear options on our common stock our decision to use implied volatility is based upon the availability of actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility we base the riskfree interest rate that we use in our option valuation model on the implied yield in effect at the time of option grant on constant maturity us treasury issues with equivalent remaining terms we use an annualized expected dividend yield in our option valuation model we estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 

 35 

tables of contents 

we use historical data to estimate prevesting option forfeitures and record sharebased compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest we amortize the fair value of options on a straightline basis over the requisite service periods of the awards which are generally the vesting periods we may elect to use different assumptions under our option valuation model in the future which could materially affect our net income or loss and net income or loss per share 

restricted stock units rsus granted typically vest based on continued service we value these timebased rsus at the date of grant using the intrinsic value method adjusted for estimated forfeitures we amortize the fair value of timebased rsus on a straightline basis adjusted for estimated forfeitures over the service period certain rsus granted to senior management vest based on the achievement of preestablished performance or market goals we estimate the fair value of performancebased rsus at the date of grant using the intrinsic value method and the probability that the specified performance criteria will be met adjusted for estimated forfeitures each quarter we update our assessment of the probability that the specified performance criteria will be achieved and adjust our estimate of the fair value of the performancebased rsus if necessary we amortize the fair values of performancebased rsus over the requisite service period adjusted for estimated forfeitures for each separately vesting tranche of the award we estimate the fair value of marketbased rsus at the date of grant using a monte carlo valuation methodology and amortize those fair values over the requisite service period adjusted for estimated forfeitures for each separately vesting tranche of the award the monte carlo methodology that we use to estimate the fair value of marketbased rsus at the date of grant incorporates into the valuation the possibility that the market condition may not be satisfied provided that the requisite service is rendered the total fair value of the marketbased rsus at the date of grant must be recognized as compensation expense even if the market condition is not achieved however the number of shares that ultimately vest can vary significantly with the performance of the specified market criteria all of the rsus we grant have dividend rights that are subject to the same vesting requirements as the underlying equity awards so we do not adjust the intrinsic market value of our rsus for dividends see note 11 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report for more information 

legal contingencies 

we are subject to certain legal proceedings as well as demands claims and threatened litigation that arise in the normal course of our business we review the status of each significant matter quarterly and assess our potential financial exposure if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated we record a liability and an expense for the estimated loss if we determine that a loss is possible and the range of the loss can be reasonably determined then we disclose the range of the possible loss significant judgment is required in the determination of whether a potential loss is probable reasonably possible or remote as well as in the determination of whether a potential exposure is reasonably estimable our accruals are based on the best information available at the time as additional information becomes available we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates potential legal liabilities and the revision of estimates of potential legal liabilities could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 

accounting for income taxes – estimates of deferred taxes valuation allowances and uncertain tax positions 

we estimate our income taxes based on the various jurisdictions where we conduct business significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax rules and the potential for future adjustment of our uncertain tax positions by the united states internal revenue service or other taxing jurisdictions we estimate our current tax liability and assess temporary differences that result from differing treatments of certain items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which we show on our balance sheet we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized to the extent we believe that realization is not likely we establish a valuation allowance when we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in an accounting period we record a corresponding tax expense in our statement of operations 

at july 31 2014  we had net deferred tax assets of 72 million  which included a valuation allowance of 24 million  for loss and tax credit carryforwards related to state tax credits state capital and operating losses and foreign losses we recorded the valuation allowance to reflect uncertainties about whether we will be able to utilize some of our deferred tax assets before they expire while we believe our current valuation allowance is sufficient we could in the future be required to increase the valuation allowance to take into account additional deferred tax assets that we may be unable to realize we assess the need for an adjustment to the valuation allowance on a quarterly basis the assessment is based on our estimates of future sources of taxable income for the jurisdictions in which we operate and the periods over which our deferred tax assets will be realizable see note 10 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report for more information

we recognize and measure benefits for uncertain tax positions using a twostep approach the first step is to evaluate the tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon audit including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes for tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely of being realized upon settlement significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions we evaluate our uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis our evaluations are based upon a number of factors including changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law correspondence with tax authorities during the course of audits and effective settlement of audit issues changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in material increases or decreases in our income tax expense in the period in which we make the change which could have a material impact on our effective tax rate and operating results

segment results 

the information below is organized in accordance with our three reportable segments all of our segments operate primarily in the united states and sell primarily to customers in the united states international total net revenue was approximately 5 of consolidated total net revenue for all periods presented 

segment operating income is segment net revenue less segment cost of revenue and operating expenses segment expenses do not include certain costs such as corporate selling and marketing product development and general and administrative expenses and sharebased compensation expenses which are not allocated to specific segments these unallocated costs totaled 890 million in fiscal 2014  809 million in fiscal 2013  and 724 million in fiscal 2012  unallocated costs increased in fiscal 2014  compared with fiscal 2013  and in fiscal 2013  compared with fiscal 2012  due to increases in corporate product development and selling and marketing expenses in support of the growth of our businesses and to a lesser extent due to increases in sharebased compensation expenses segment expenses also do not include amortization of acquired technology amortization of other acquired intangible assets and goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges see note 14 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report for reconciliations of total segment operating income to consolidated operating income from continuing operations for each fiscal year presented 

we calculate revenue growth rates and segment operating margin figures using dollars in thousands those results may vary slightly from figures calculated using the dollars in millions presented 

small business 



service and other revenue in our small business segment is derived primarily from quickbooks online and quickbooks online accountant our hosted financial and business management offerings quickbooks pro plus quickbooks premier plus and quickbooks accountant plus our subscription offerings quickbooks technical support plans small business payroll services including quickbooks online payroll intuit online payroll intuit full service payroll and quickbooks assisted payroll payment processing services for small businesses demandforce and quickbase product revenue in our small business segment is derived primarily from quickbooks desktop software products including quickbooks pro quickbooks premier quickbooks accountant and quickbooks enterprise solutions quickbooks basic payroll and quickbooks enhanced payroll quickbooks point of sale solutions proadvisor program subscriptions for the accounting professionals who serve small businesses and financial supplies 

as part of our connected services strategy over the past several quarters we have been focusing small business segment resources on the enhancement and marketing of our quickbooks online and quickbooks desktop subscription offerings as a result quickbooks desktop license units and revenue have been declining as more customers choose our hosted and subscription offerings and we expect this trend to continue in our payments business we have recently begun focusing resources on core offerings for quickbooks merchants in support of our small business ecosystem approach over the next few quarters we anticipate declining revenue for certain nonquickbooks payments offerings that may slow overall revenue growth in our payments business

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

investment portfolio 

we actively monitor market conditions and developments specific to the securities in which we invest we believe that we take a conservative approach to investing our funds in that we invest only in highlyrated securities and diversify our portfolio of investments while we believe we take prudent measures to mitigate investment related risks such risks cannot be fully eliminated because of market circumstances that are outside our control 

our investments consist of instruments that meet quality standards that are consistent with our investment policy this policy specifies that except for direct obligations of the united states government securities issued by agencies of the united states government and money market funds we diversify our investments by limiting our holdings with any individual issuer we do not hold derivative financial instruments or european sovereign debt in our portfolio of investments see note 3 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report for a summary of the amortized cost and fair value of our investments by type of issue 

 46 

tables of contents 

the following table presents our portfolio of cash equivalents and availableforsale debt securities as of july 31 2014  by stated maturity the table is classified by the original maturity date listed on the security and includes cash equivalents which consist primarily of money market funds at july 31 2014  the weighted average tax adjusted interest rate earned on our money market accounts was 005  and the weighted average tax adjusted interest rate earned on our investments was 037  



interest rate risk 

our cash equivalents and investments are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates interest rate movements affect the interest income we earn on cash equivalents and investments and the value of those investments should the federal reserve target rate increase by 25 basis points from the level of july 31 2014  the value of our investments would decrease by approximately 4  million should the federal reserve target rate increase by 100 basis points from the level of july 31 2014  the value of our investments would decrease by approximately 15 million 

we are also exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates as they affect our 500 million revolving credit facility advances under the credit facility accrue interest at rates that are equal to jp morgans alternate base rate plus a margin that ranges from 00  to 05  or the london interbank offered rate libor plus a margin that ranges from 09  to 15  in both cases based on our senior debt ratings consequently our interest expense would fluctuate with changes in the general level of these interest rates if we were to borrow any amounts under the credit facility at july 31 2014  no amounts were outstanding under the credit facility 

on march 12 2007 we issued 500 million of 575 senior unsecured notes due on march 15 2017 we carry these senior notes at face value less unamortized discount on our balance sheets since these senior notes bear interest at fixed rates we have no financial statement risk associated with changes in interest rates however the fair value of these notes fluctuates when interest rates change see note 2 and note 9 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report for more information 

impact of foreign currency rate changes 

the functional currencies of our international operating subsidiaries are generally the local currencies we translate the assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries at the exchange rates in effect on the balance sheet date we translate their revenue costs and expenses at the average rates of exchange in effect during the period we include translation gains and losses in the stockholders’ equity section of our balance sheets we include net gains and losses resulting from foreign exchange transactions in interest and other income in our statements of operations 

since we translate foreign currencies primarily canadian dollars indian rupees singapore dollars british pounds and australian dollars into us dollars for financial reporting purposes currency fluctuations can have an impact on our financial results the historical impact of currency fluctuations has generally been immaterial we believe that our exposure to currency exchange fluctuation risk is not significant primarily because our global subsidiaries invoice customers and satisfy their financial obligations almost exclusively in their local currencies although the impact of currency fluctuations on our financial results has generally been immaterial in the past and we believe that for the reasons cited above currency fluctuations will not be significant in the future there can be no guarantee that the impact of currency fluctuations will not be material in the future as of july 31 2014  we did not engage in foreign currency hedging activities

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

during our most recent fiscal quarter there has not occurred any change in our internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls 

our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer believes that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and that they are effective at the reasonable assurance level however no matter how well conceived and executed a control system can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met the design of any control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs there are also limitations that are inherent in any control system these limitations include the realities that breakdowns can occur because of errors in judgment or mistakes and that controls can be circumvented by individual persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls because of these inherent limitations in a cost effective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected

this strategy recognizes the emergence and influence of the digital generation the increasing relevance of social networks and customers’ growing reliance on the internet mobile devices and informationbased technology to manage important financial tasks it also acknowledges the potential of new market opportunities around the world the result is a global market that is shifting from traditional services that are paperbased humanproduced and brickandmortar bound to one where people understand demand and embrace the benefits of connected services 

we continue to make significant progress in this environment connected services total service and other revenue generated 27 billion or 64 percent of our total revenue in fiscal 2013  compared with about 50 percent of our total revenue five years ago within connected services software as a service offerings by themselves produced about 15 billion or 37 percent of our total revenue in fiscal 2013

product development 

since the markets for software and related services are characterized by rapid technological change shifting customer needs and frequent new product introductions and enhancements a continuous high level of investment is required to innovate and quickly develop new products and services as well as enhance existing offerings our product development efforts are becoming more important than ever as we pursue our connected services strategy which reflects a world where people and businesses are increasingly connected by technology and expect access to services at any time in any place 

we develop many of our products and services internally we have a number of united states and foreign patents and pending applications that relate to various aspects of our products and technology we supplement our internal development efforts by acquiring or licensing products and technology from third parties and establishing other relationships that enable us to enhance or expand our offerings more rapidly we expect to expand our third party technology relationships as we continue to pursue our connected services strategy 

our traditional core desktop software products – quickbooks turbotax lacerte proseries and quicken – tend to have predictable annual development and product release cycles we also develop innovative new offerings such as snaptax snap payroll gopayment mint mobile and other mobile applications for which development cycles can be more rapid developing consumer and professional tax software and services presents unique challenges because of the demanding development cycle required to accurately incorporate tax law and tax form changes within a rigid timetable the development timing for our payroll and merchant services offerings varies with business needs and regulatory requirements and the length of the development cycle depends on the scope and complexity of each project 

we continue to make substantial investments in research and development and we expect to focus our future research and development efforts on enhancing existing products and services and on developing new products and services including new mobile and global offerings we also expect to continue to focus significant research and development efforts on ongoing projects to update the technology platforms for several of our offerings our research and development expenses were 685  million or 17  of total net revenue in fiscal 2013  618 million or 16  of total net revenue in fiscal 2012  and 566 million or 16  of total net revenue in fiscal 2011  

seasonality 

our quickbooks consumer tax and accounting professionals businesses are highly seasonal revenue from our quickbooks software products tends to be highest during our second and third fiscal quarters sales of income tax preparation products and services are heavily concentrated in the period from november through april in our consumer tax business a greater proportion of our revenue has been occurring later in this seasonal period due in part to the growth in sales of turbotax online for which revenue is recognized upon printing or electronic filing of a tax return the seasonality of our consumer tax and accounting professionals revenue is also affected by the timing of the availability of tax forms from taxing agencies and the ability of those agencies to receive electronic tax return submissions delays in the availability of tax forms or the ability of taxing agencies to receive submissions can cause revenue to shift between our fiscal quarters these seasonal patterns mean that our total net revenue is usually highest during our second quarter ending january 31 and third quarter ending april 30 we typically report losses in our first quarter ending october 31 and fourth quarter ending july 31 during these quarters revenue from our tax businesses is minimal while core operating expenses such as research and development continue at relatively consistent levels we believe the seasonality of our revenue and profitability is likely to continue in the future

marketing sales and distribution channels 

markets 

our primary target customers are small businesses consumers and accounting professionals the markets in which we compete have always been characterized by rapid technological change shifting customer needs and frequent new product introductions and enhancements by competitors over the past several years the widespread availability of the internet mobile devices and the explosion of social media have accelerated the pace of change and revolutionized the way that customers learn about evaluate and purchase products and services

marketing programs 

to sell our products and services to small businesses consumers and accounting professionals we use a variety of traditional and innovative marketing programs to generate software orders stimulate demand and generally maintain and increase customer awareness of our product portfolio these programs include web marketing and targeted advertising such as search engine optimization and purchasing key words from major search engine companies placing and promoting our mobile applications in proprietary online stores directresponse mail and email campaigns telephone solicitations newspaper magazine billboard radio and television advertising social media campaigns and coordinated promotional offers with major retailers we also use workflowintegrated inproduct discovery in some of our software products to market other related products and services including thirdparty products and services in addition we create marketing campaigns that attract new users through free promotional offerings that are designed to ultimately convert them to paying customers 

sales and distribution channels 

multichannel shopandbuy experiences  our consumer and small business customers increasingly use the internet and mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets to research products and services some customers buy and use our products and services entirely online or through their mobile devices others purchase desktop products and services using the internet still others make their final decision at a retail location we coordinate our websites promotions and retail displays to support this integrated multichannel shopandbuy model 

direct sales channel  we sell many of our products and services for small businesses consumers and accounting professionals directly through our websites and call centers telesales continues to be an effective channel for serving customers that want live help to select the products and services that are right for their needs 

retail channel  we sell our quickbooks turbotax and quicken desktop software as well as payroll services and merchant credit card payment processing services at retail locations across the united states we sell these products and services directly and through distributors to office supply superstores warehouse clubs consumer electronics retailers general mass merchandisers online retailers and catalogs in canada and other international markets we also rely on distributors and other third parties who sell products into the retail channel the retail channel provides broad customer reach through retailersponsored advertising and exposure to retail foot traffic this channel also gives us the opportunity to communicate our products services and messages through multiple touch points and allows us to serve our customers at relatively modest cost 

online mobile application stores   we distribute many of our offerings for mobile devices through proprietary online stores that provide applications for specific devices these include the apple app store which provides apps for the apple iphone and ipad and google’s play store which provides apps for androidcompatible smartphones and tablets 

other channels  we have strategies to address the alliance partner solution provider and personal computer hardware manufacturer channels revenue from these channels is currently less significant than revenue from our direct and retail channels but it is growing we sell our consumer and small business products and services through selected alliance partners primarily banks credit unions and securities and investment firms these alliance partners help us reach new customers at the point of transaction and drive growth and market share by extending our online reach solution providers combine our products and services with valueadded marketing sales and technical expertise to deliver a complete solution at the local level relationships with selected personal computer hardware manufacturers help us attract new customers for our core software offerings as we expand our mobile and global offerings we expect that strategic partnerships will become increasingly

competition 

overview 

we face intense competition in all of our businesses both domestically and internationally competitive interest and expertise in many of the markets we serve have grown markedly over the past few years and we expect this trend to continue some of our existing competitors have significantly greater financial technical and marketing resources than we do in addition the competitive landscape can shift rapidly as new companies enter markets in which we compete this is particularly true for online and mobile products and services where the barriers to entry are lower than they are for desktop software products and services to attract customers many online and mobile competitors are offering free or lowpriced entrylevel products which we must take into account in our pricing strategies 

our most obvious competition comes from other companies that offer technology solutions similar to ours however for many of our products and services other important competitive alternatives for customers are third party service providers such as professional accountants and seasonal assisted tax preparation businesses manual tools and processes or generalpurpose software are also important competitive alternatives 

competition specific to business segments 

small business group  our quickbooks desktop product is the leading small business financial management software in the us retail channel our small business products and services face competitive challenges from companies such as the sage group plc which offers software and associated services that directly target small business customers increasingly our small business products and services also face competition from newer online accounting offerings from companies such as xero free or lowcost online accounting offerings and free online banking and bill payment services offered by financial institutions and others in our payroll business we compete directly with automatic data processing inc adp paychex and many other companies with payroll offerings including online payroll offerings in our merchant services business we compete directly with large financial institutions such as wells fargo jp morgan chase and bank of america and with many payment processors including first data corporation elavon global payments and fiscertegy 

consumer tax  our future growth depends on our ability to attract new customers to the selfpreparation tax category from tax stores and other seasonal assisted tax preparers in the private sector we face intense competition from hr block which provides assisted tax preparation services in its stores and a competing software offering called hr block at home we also face competition from several other large assisted tax preparation service providers from a myriad of small seasonal tax preparers and from numerous online selfpreparation offerings including 2nd story software’s taxact these competing offerings subject us to significant price pressure 

we also face competitive challenges in our consumer tax business from publicly funded government entities that offer electronic tax preparation and filing services at no cost to individual taxpayers we are a member of the free file alliance a consortium of private sector companies that has entered into an agreement with the federal government under this agreement the member companies provide online federal tax preparation and filing services at no cost to eligible federal taxpayers and the federal government has agreed not to provide a competing service approximately 20 states have also adopted free file alliance publicprivate agreements while approximately 20 other states offer some form of direct government tax preparation and filing services free to qualified taxpayers we continue to actively work with others in the private and public sectors to advance the goals of the free file alliance policy initiative and to support successful publicprivate partnerships however future administrative regulatory or legislative activity in this area could harm our consumer tax business 

accounting professionals  our lacerte professional tax offerings face competition from competitivelypriced tax and accounting solutions that include integration with nontax functionality these include cch’s prosystems fx office suite and thomson reuters’ cs professional suite and gosystems tax our proseries professional tax offerings face competition from cch’s atx and taxwise offerings we also face growing competition from online tax and accounting offerings which may be marketed more effectively or have lower pricing than our offerings for accounting professionals 

competitive factors 

we believe the most important competitive factors for our core offerings — quickbooks turbotax lacerte proseries and quicken — are ease of use product features size of the installed customer base brand name recognition value proposition 

 11 

tables of contents 

cost reliability and product and support quality access to distribution channels is also important for our quickbooks turbotax and quicken software products in addition support from accounting professionals and the ability for customers to upgrade within product families as their businesses grow are significant competitive factors for our quickbooks products productivity is an important competitive factor for the fullservice accounting firms to which we market our lacerte software products we believe we compete effectively on these factors as our quickbooks turbotax and quicken products are the leading products in the us retail sales channel for their respective categories 

for our service offerings such as small business payroll and merchant payment processing we believe the most important competitive factors are functionality ease of use high availability the integration of these products with related software brand name recognition effective distribution quality of support and cost 

customer service and technical support 

we provide customer service and technical support by telephone email online chat text messaging online communities and our customer service and technical support websites we have fulltime and outsourced customer service and technical support staffs we supplement these staffs with seasonal employees and additional outsourcing during periods of peak call volumes such as during the tax return filing season or following a major product launch we outsource to several firms domestically and internationally most of our internationally outsourced consumer and small business customer service and technical support personnel are currently located in india and the philippines 

we offer free selfhelp information through our technical support websites for our quickbooks turbotax accounting professionals and quicken software products customers can use our websites to find answers to commonly asked questions and check on the status of orders under certain paid support plans customers can also use our websites to receive product updates electronically support alternatives and fees vary by product we also sponsor online user communities such as intuit community for small businesses and accounting professionals and turbotax live community where consumers can share knowledge and product advice with each other beginning with the 2011 tax season we began offering free tax advice from usbased tax professionals to turbotax users 

manufacturing and distribution 

online products and services 

intuit’s data centers house most of the systems networks and databases required to operate and deliver our online products and services these include quickbooks online online payroll services merchant payment processing services online customer marketing and communication services for small businesses turbotax online intuit tax online consumer and professional electronic tax filing services and mint through our data centers we connect customers to our products and services and store customer and business information as our businesses continue to move toward delivering more online and mobile products and services in conjunction with our connected services strategy we expect that our infrastructure will become even more critical to our business in the future 

our primary data center is located at a facility we own in washington state and we have a primary backup facility at a colocated data center in nevada we also have a number of other data centers that are primarily located in the western united states we continue to execute on a multiyear plan to transition to fewer data centers in more geographically diverse locations 

desktop software and supplies 

the key processes in manufacturing desktop software are manufacturing compact discs cds printing boxes and related materials and assembling and shipping the final products 

for retail manufacturing we have an agreement with arvato digital services inc adis a division of bertelsmann ag under which adis provides a majority of the manufacturing volume for our launches of quickbooks turbotax and quicken as well as for daytoday replenishment after product launches adis has operations in multiple locations that can provide redundancy if necessary we also have an agreement with jvc america inc under which jvc provides outsourced manufacturing volume for these launches and for daytoday replenishment 

for retail distribution we have an agreement with adis under which adis handles all logistics services our retail product launches are operationally complex our model for product delivery for retail launches and replenishment is a hybrid of direct

to store deliveries and shipments to central warehouse locations this allows improved inventory management by our retailers we also ship products for many of our smaller retail customers through distributors 

adis also provides most of the manufacturing volume and distribution services for our direct desktop software orders we have an exclusive agreement with harland clarke a division of mf worldwide corporation to fulfill orders for all of our printed checks and most other products for our financial supplies business 

we have multiple sources for all of our raw materials and availability has historically not been a significant problem for us 

prior to major product releases for our core desktop software products we tend to have significant levels of backlog but at other times backlog is minimal and we typically ship products within a few days of receiving an order because of this fluctuation in backlog we believe that backlog is not a reliable predictor of our future core desktop software sales 

privacy and security of customer information and transactions 

we are subject to various federal state and international laws and regulations and to financial institution and healthcare provider requirements relating to the privacy and security of customer and employee personal information we are also subject to laws and regulations that apply to the internet behavioral tracking mobile applications telemarketing email activities data hosting and retention financial and health information and credit reporting additional laws in all of these areas are likely to be passed in the future which could result in significant limitations on or changes to the ways in which we can collect use host store or transmit the personal information and data of our customers or employees communicate with our customers and deliver products and services or may significantly increase our compliance costs as our business expands to new industry segments and new uses of data that are regulated for privacy and security or to countries outside the united states that have strict data protections laws our compliance requirements and costs will increase 

through a master privacy policy framework designed to be consistent with globally recognized privacy principles we comply with united states federal and other country guidelines and practices to help ensure that customers and employees are aware of and can control how we use information about them our primary websites and online products such as intuitcom quickbooks and turbotax have been certified by truste an independent organization that operates a website and online product privacy certification program representing industry standard practices to address users’ and regulators’ concerns about online privacy we also use privacy statements to provide notice to customers of our privacy practices as well as provide them the opportunity to furnish instructions with respect to use of their personal information we participate in industry groups whose purpose is to develop or influence industry best practices and to influence public policy for privacy and security 

to address security concerns we use security safeguards to help protect the systems and the information customers give to us from loss misuse and unauthorized alteration whenever customers transmit sensitive information such as a credit card number or tax return data through one of our websites or products we use industry standards to encrypt the data as it is transmitted to us we work to protect our systems from unauthorized internal or external access using numerous commercially available computer security products as well as internally developed security procedures and practices

our consumer tax and accounting professionals businesses are subject to federal and state government requirements including regulations related to the electronic filing of tax returns the provision of tax preparer assistance and the use and disclosure of customer information in addition we offer certain other products and services such as small business payroll merchant payment processing services and insurance which are subject to special regulatory requirements as we expand our products and services both domestically and internationally we may become subject to additional government regulation further regulators may adopt new laws or regulations or their interpretation of existing laws or regulations may differ from ours these increased regulatory requirements could impose significant limitations on our business and increase our cost of compliance 

we are subject to federal and state laws and government regulations concerning employee safety and health and environmental matters the occupational safety and health administration the environmental protection agency and other federal and state agencies have the authority to put regulations in place that may have an impact on our operations

intellectual property 

our success depends on the proprietary technology embodied in our offerings we protect this proprietary technology by relying on a variety of intellectual property mechanisms including copyright patent trade secret and trademark laws restrictions on disclosure and other methods for example we regularly file applications for patents copyrights and trademarks and service marks in order to protect intellectual property that we believe is important to our business we hold a small but growing patent portfolio that we believe is important to intuits overall competitive advantage although we are not materially dependent on any one patent or particular group of patents in our portfolio at this time we also have a number of registered trademarks that include intuit quickbooks turbotax lacerte proseries quicken and mint we have registered these and other trademarks and service marks in the united states and depending on the relevance of each brand to other markets in many foreign countries most registrations can be renewed perpetually at 10year intervals we also license intellectual property from third parties for use in our products 

although our portfolio of patents is growing the patents that have been issued to us could be determined to be invalid and may not be enforceable against competitive products in every jurisdiction in addition third parties have asserted and may in the future assert infringement claims against us and our customers these claims and any litigation may result in invalidation of our proprietary rights or a finding of infringement along with an assessment of damages litigation even if without merit could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention in addition third party licenses may not continue to be available to us on commercially acceptable terms or at all 

employees 

as of july 31 2013  we had approximately 8000  fulltime employees in major offices in the united states canada india the united kingdom and other locations we also employ a significant number of seasonal and contract employees during the second and third quarters of our fiscal years to support our consumer tax customers for example at the peak of the 2012 tax season we employed approximately 850 seasonal employees we believe our future success and growth will depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees in all areas of our business we do not currently have any collective bargaining agreements with our employees and we believe employee relations are generally good although we have employmentrelated agreements with a number of key employees these agreements do not guarantee continued service we believe we offer competitive compensation and a good working environment we were named one of fortune  magazine’s “100 best companies to work for” in each of the last twelve years however we face intense competition for qualified employees and we expect to face continuing challenges in recruiting and retention

forwardlooking statements and risk factors 

this annual report on form 10k contains forwardlooking statements all statements in this report other than statements that are purely historical are forwardlooking statements words such as “expect” “anticipate” “intend” “plan” “believe” “forecast” “estimate” “seek” and similar expressions also identify forwardlooking statements in this report forwardlooking statements include without limitation the following

tables of contents 

we caution investors that forwardlooking statements are only predictions based on our current expectations about future events and are not guarantees of future performance we encourage you to read carefully all information provided in this report and in our other filings with the sec before deciding to invest in our stock or to maintain or change your investment these forwardlooking statements are based on information as of the filing date of this annual report and we undertake no obligation to revise or update any forwardlooking statement for any reason 

because forwardlooking statements involve risks and uncertainties there are important factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forwardlooking statements these factors include the following 

we face intense competitive pressures that may harm our operating results 

we face intense competition in all of our businesses and we expect competition to remain intense in the future our competitors and potential competitors range from large and established entities to emerging startups our competitors may introduce superior products and services reduce prices have greater technical marketing and other resources have greater name recognition have larger installed bases of customers have wellestablished relationships with our current and potential customers advertise aggressively or beat us to market with new products and services in addition we may face competition from existing companies with large established consumer userbases and broadbased platforms who may change or expand the focus of their business strategies and marketing to target our customers including small businesses and tax customers we also face intensified competition from providers of free accounting tax payments and other financial services in order to compete we have also introduced free offerings in several categories but we may not be able to attract customers or effectively monetize all of these offerings and customers who have formerly paid for intuit’s products and services may elect to use free offerings instead these competitive factors may diminish our revenue and profitability and harm our ability to acquire and retain customers 

our consumer tax business also faces significant competition from the public sector where we face the risk of federal and state taxing authorities developing software or other systems to facilitate tax return preparation and electronic filing at no charge to taxpayers these or similar programs may be introduced or expanded in the future which may cause us to lose customers and revenue although the free file alliance has kept the federal government from being a direct competitor to intuit’s tax offerings it has fostered additional online competition and may cause us to lose significant revenue opportunities the current agreement with the free file alliance is scheduled to expire in october 2014 we anticipate that governmental encroachment at both the federal and state levels may present a continued competitive threat to our business for the foreseeable future 

future revenue growth depends upon our ability to adapt to technological change and successfully introduce new and enhanced products services and business models 

the software as a service desktop software and mobile technology industries are characterized by rapidly changing technology evolving industry standards and frequent new product introductions as we continue to grow our software as a service mobile and other offerings we must continue to innovate and develop new products and features to meet changing customer needs and attract and retain talented software developers we need to continue to develop our skills tools and capabilities to capitalize on existing and emerging technologies which require us to devote significant resources 

a number of our businesses also derive a significant amount of their revenue from onetime upfront license fees and rely on customer upgrades and service offerings to generate a significant portion of their revenues in addition our consumer and professional tax businesses depend significantly on revenue from customers who return each year to use our updated tax preparation and filing software and services as our existing products mature encouraging customers to purchase product upgrades becomes more challenging unless new product releases provide features and functionality that have meaningful incremental value if we are not able to develop and clearly demonstrate the value of new or upgraded products or services to our customers our revenues may be harmed in addition as we continue to introduce and expand our new business models including offerings that are subscriptionbased or that are free to end users we may be unsuccessful in monetizing or increasing customer adoption of these offerings 

the number of people who access products and services through devices other than personal computers including mobile phones smartphones and handheld computers such as tablets has increased dramatically in the past few years we have limited experience to date in developing products and services for users of these alternative devices and the versions of our products and services developed for these devices may not be compelling to users even if we are able to attract new users through these mobile offerings the amount of revenue that we derive per user from mobile offerings may be less than the revenue that we have historically derived from users of personal computers as new devices and new platforms are continually being released it is difficult to predict the problems we may encounter in developing versions of our products and services for use on these alternative devices and we may need to devote significant resources to the creation support and maintenance of 

 16 

tables of contents 

such offerings if we are slow to develop products and technologies that are compatible with these alternative devices of if our competitors are able to achieve those results more quickly than us we will fail to capture a significant share of an increasingly important portion of the market for online services which could adversely affect our business 

in some cases we may expend a significant amount of resources and management attention on offerings that do not ultimately succeed in their markets we have encountered difficulty in launching new products and services in the past if we misjudge customer needs in the future our new products and services may not succeed and our revenues and earnings may be harmed we have also invested and in the future expect to invest in new business models geographies strategies and initiatives such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties including distraction of management from current operations expenses associated with the initiatives and inadequate return on investments because these new initiatives are inherently risky they may not be successful and may harm our financial condition and operating results 

business interruption or failure of our information technology and communication systems may impair the availability of our products and services which may damage our reputation and harm our future financial results 

as we continue to transition our business to more connected services we become more dependent on the continuing operation and availability of our information technology and communication systems and those of our external service providers including for example third party internetbased or cloud computing services we do not have redundancy for all of our systems many of our critical applications reside in only one of our data centers and our disaster recovery planning may not account for all eventualities we also do not maintain realtime backup of all our data and in the event of significant system disruption we may experience loss of data or processing capabilities which may cause us to lose customers and may materially harm our reputation and our operating results in addition we are in the process of updating our customer facing applications and the supporting information technology infrastructure to meet our customers’ expectations for continuous service availability any difficulties in upgrading these applications or infrastructure or failure of our systems or those of our thirdparty service providers may result in interruptions in our service which may reduce our revenues and profits cause us to lose customers and damage our reputation any prolonged interruptions at any time may result in lost customers additional refunds of customer charges negative publicity and increased operating costs any of which may significantly harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are in the process of migrating our applications and infrastructure to new data centers if we do not execute the transition to the new data centers in an effective manner we may experience unplanned service disruptions or unforeseen increases in costs which may harm our operating results and our business 

our business operations data centers information technology and communications systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters human error malicious attacks fire power loss telecommunications failures computer viruses computer denial of service attacks terrorist attacks and other events beyond our control the majority of our research and development activities our corporate headquarters our principal information technology systems and other critical business operations are located near major seismic faults we do not carry earthquake insurance for direct quakerelated losses our future financial results may be materially harmed in the event of a major earthquake or other natural or manmade disaster 

we rely on internal systems and external systems maintained by manufacturers distributors and other service providers to take and fulfill customer orders handle customer service requests and host certain online activities any interruption or failure of our internal or external systems may prevent us or our service providers from accepting and fulfilling customer orders or cause company and customer data to be unintentionally disclosed our continuing efforts to upgrade and expand our network security and other information systems as well as our highavailability capabilities may be costly and problems with the design or implementation of system enhancements may harm our business and our results of operations 

our hosting collection use and retention of personal customer information and data require costly compliance efforts and a breach of our security measures could disrupt our businesses result in the disclosure of confidential information damage our reputation and cause losses 

a number of our businesses collect use and retain large amounts of personal customer information and data including credit card numbers tax return information bank account numbers and passwords personal and business financial data social security numbers healthcare information and payroll information we may also develop new business models that use certain personal information or data derived from personal information in addition we collect and maintain personal information of our employees in the ordinary course of our business some of this personal customer and employee information is held and some transactions are executed by third parties in addition as many of our products and services are webbased and mobile applicationbased the amount of data we store for our users on our servers and the servers of our vendors that provide hosting services including personal information has been increasing and will continue to increase as we further transition our 

 17 

tables of contents 

businesses to connected services we and our vendors use commercially available security technologies to protect transactions and personal information we use security and business controls to limit access and use of personal information and require our vendors to implement similar controls however we may not have the ability to effectively monitor the implementation of the security measures of our vendors and in any event individuals or third parties may be able to circumvent these security and business measures and errors in the storage use or transmission of personal information may result in a breach of customer or employee privacy or theft of assets which may require notification under applicable data privacy regulations we employ contractors temporary and seasonal employees who may have access to the personal information of customers and employees or who may execute transactions in the normal course of their duties while we conduct background checks of our employees and other individuals and limit access to systems and data it is possible that one or more of these individuals may circumvent these controls resulting in a security breach 

we are subject to laws rules and regulations relating to the collection use and security of user data new laws in this area have been passed by several jurisdictions and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions these new laws may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and our current data protection policies and practices may not be consistent with those interpretations and applications in addition the ability to execute transactions and the possession and use of personal information and data in conducting our business subjects us to legislative and regulatory burdens that may require notification to customers or employees of a security breach restrict our use of personal information and hinder our ability to acquire new customers or market to existing customers as our business continues to expand to new industry segments that may be more highly regulated for privacy and data security and to countries outside the united states that have more strict data protection laws our compliance requirements and costs may increase we have incurred – and may continue to incur – significant expenses to comply with mandatory privacy and security standards and protocols imposed by law regulation industry standards or contractual obligations 

a major breach of our security measures or those of third parties that provide hosting services for us execute transactions or hold and manage personal information may have serious negative consequences for our businesses including possible fines penalties and damages reduced customer demand for our services harm to our reputation and brands further regulation and oversight by federal or state agencies and loss of our ability to provide financial transaction services or accept and process customer credit card orders or tax returns from time to time we detect or receive notices from customers or public or private agencies that they have detected vulnerabilities in our servers our software or thirdparty software components that are distributed with our products the existence of vulnerabilities even if they do not result in a security breach may harm customer confidence and require substantial resources to address and we may not be able to discover or remediate such security vulnerabilities before they are exploited in addition our technologies systems and networks and our customers devices have been subject to and are likely to continue to be the target of cyber attacks computer viruses worms phishing attacks malicious software programs and other information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release gathering monitoring misuse loss or destruction of our customers confidential proprietary and other information or otherwise disrupt our or our customers or other third parties business operations although this is an industrywide problem that affects software across platforms it is increasingly affecting our offerings because hackers tend to focus their efforts on wellknown offerings that are popular among customers and we expect them to continue to do so if hackers are able to circumvent our security measures or if we are unable to detect an intrusion into our systems and contain such intrusion in a reasonable amount of time some of our customers personal information may be compromised although we have commercially available network and application security internal control measures and physical security procedures to safeguard our systems there can be no assurance that a security breach intrusion loss or theft of personal information will not occur which may harm our business customer reputation and future financial results and may require us to expend significant resources to address these problems including notification under data privacy regulations 

if we are unable to develop manage and maintain critical third party business relationships our business may be adversely affected 

our growth is dependent on the strength of our business relationships and our ability to continue to develop maintain and leverage new and existing relationships we rely on various third party partners including software and service providers suppliers vendors manufacturers distributors contractors financial institutions core processors licensing partners and development partners among others in many areas of our business in order to deliver our offerings and operate our business we also rely on third parties to support the operation of our business by maintaining our physical facilities equipment power systems and infrastructure in certain instances these third party relationships are sole source or limited source relationships and can be difficult to replace or substitute depending on the level of integration of the third party’s products or services into or with our offerings andor the general availability of such third party’s products and services in addition there may be few or no alternative third party providers or vendors in the market further there can be no assurance that we will be able to adequately retain third party contractors engaged to help us operate our business the failure of third parties to provide acceptable and high quality products services and technologies or to update their products services and technologies may

tables of contents 

result in a disruption to our business operations and our customers which may reduce our revenues and profits cause us to lose customers and damage our reputation alternative arrangements and services may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or we may experience business interruptions upon a transition to an alternative partner 

in particular we have relationships with banks credit unions and other financial institutions that support certain critical services we offer to our other customers if macroeconomic conditions or other factors cause any of these institutions to fail consolidate stop providing certain services or institute costcutting efforts our business and financial results may suffer and we may be unable to offer those services to our customers 

we have also started to increasingly utilize the distribution platforms of third parties like apples app store and googles play store for the distribution of certain of our product offerings although we benefit from the strong brand recognition and large user base of these distribution platforms to attract new customers the platform owners have wide discretion to change the pricing structure terms of service and other policies with respect to us and other developers any adverse changes by these third parties could adversely affect our financial results     

increased government regulation of our businesses may harm our operating results 

many of our businesses are regulated under federal state and local laws including our tax accounting professionals payroll and payments businesses there have been significant new regulations and heightened focus by the government on many of these areas as well as in areas such as insurance and healthcare including for example the affordable care act that affect certain of our products and services in addition as we expand our products and services and revise our business models both domestically and internationally we may become subject to additional government regulation or increased regulatory scrutiny further regulators may adopt new laws or regulations or their interpretation of existing laws or regulations may differ from ours these regulatory requirements could impose significant limitations require changes to our business or cause changes in customer purchasing behavior that may result in reduced revenue or increased costs which may affect our operating results any changes that we may incur as a result of any such regulations may not be sustained over time depending on a number of factors including market and industry reactions to such regulations 

in order to meet regulatory standards we may be required to increase investment in compliance and auditing functions or new technologies in addition government authorities may enact other laws rules or regulations that place new burdens or restrictions on our business or determine that our operations are directly subject to existing rules or regulations such as requirements related to data collection privacy use transmission retention processing and security which may make our business more costly less efficient or impossible to conduct and may require us to modify our current or future products or services which may harm our future financial results 

the tax preparation industry continues to receive heightened attention from federal and state governments new legislation regulation public policy considerations litigation by the government or private entities or new interpretations of existing laws may result in greater oversight of the tax preparation industry restrict the types of products and services that we can offer or the prices we can charge or otherwise cause us to change the way we operate our tax businesses or offer our tax products and services we may not be able to respond quickly to such regulatory legislative and other developments and these changes may in turn increase our cost of doing business and limit our revenue opportunities in addition if our practices are not consistent with new interpretations of existing laws we may become subject to lawsuits penalties and other liabilities that did not previously apply we are also required to comply with a variety of state revenue agency standards in order to successfully operate our tax preparation and electronic filing services changes in stateimposed requirements by one or more of the states including the required use of specific technologies or technology standards may significantly increase the costs of providing those services to our customers and may prevent us from delivering a quality product to our customers in a timely manner 

if we fail to process transactions effectively or fail to adequately protect against disputed or potential fraudulent activities our revenue and earnings may be harmed 

our operations process a significant volume and dollar value of transactions on a daily basis especially in our payroll and payments businesses due to the size and volume of transactions that we handle effective processing systems and controls are essential to ensure that transactions are handled appropriately despite our efforts it is possible that we may make errors or that funds may be misappropriated due to fraud the systems supporting our business are comprised of multiple technology platforms that are difficult to scale if we are unable to effectively manage our systems and processes we may be unable to process customer data in an accurate reliable and timely manner which may harm our business in our payments processing service business if merchants for whom we process payment transactions are unable to pay refunds due to their customers in connection with disputed or fraudulent merchant transactions we may be required to pay those amounts and our payments may exceed the amount of the customer reserves we have established to make such payments 

 19 

tables of contents 

the online tax preparation payroll administration and online payments industries have been experiencing an increasing amount of fraudulent activities by third parties although we do not believe that any of this activity is uniquely targeted at our business this type of fraudulent activity may adversely impact our own operations in our consumer tax payroll and payments businesses in addition to any direct damages and potential fines that may result from such fraud which may be substantial a loss of confidence in our controls may seriously harm our business and damage our brand as fraud detection and prevention abilities improve across the various industries in which we operate we may implement risk control mechanisms that could make it more difficult for legitimate customers to obtain and use our products as well as prevent the sale of our products to those parties seeking to facilitate fraudulent activity which could result in lost revenue and negatively impact our operating results 

  

third parties claiming that we infringe their proprietary rights may cause us to incur significant legal expenses and prevent us from selling our products 

as the number of products in the software industry increases and the functionality of these products further overlap and as we acquire technology through acquisitions or licenses we may become increasingly subject to infringement claims including patent copyright and trademark infringement claims litigation may be necessary to determine the validity and scope of the patent rights of others we have received an increasing number of allegations of patent infringement claims in the past and expect to receive more claims in the future based on allegations that our offerings infringe upon patents held by third parties some of these claims are the subject of pending litigation against us and against some of our customers these claims may involve patent holding companies or other adverse patent owners who have no relevant product revenues of their own and against whom our own patents may provide little or no deterrence the ultimate outcome of any allegation is uncertain and regardless of outcome any such claim with or without merit may be time consuming to defend result in costly litigation divert management’s time and attention from our business require us to stop selling delay shipping or redesign our products or require us to pay monetary damages for royalty or licensing fees or to satisfy indemnification obligations that we have with some of our customers our failure to obtain necessary license or other rights or litigation arising out of intellectual property claims may harm our business 

we rely on third party intellectual property in our products and services 

many of our products and services include intellectual property of third parties which we license under agreements that must be renewed or renegotiated from time to time we may not be able to obtain licenses to these third party technologies or content on reasonable terms or at all if we are unable to obtain the rights necessary to use this intellectual property in our products and services we may not be able to sell the affected offerings and customers who are currently using the affected product may be disrupted which may in turn harm our future financial results damage our brand and result in customer loss also we and our customers have been and may continue to be subject to infringement claims as a result of the third party intellectual property incorporated in to our offerings although we try to mitigate this risk and we may not be ultimately liable for any potential infringement pending claims require us to use significant resources require management attention and could result in loss of customers 

some of our offerings include thirdparty software that is licensed under socalled “open source” licenses some of which may include a requirement that under certain circumstances we make available or grant licenses to any modifications or derivative works we create based upon the open source software although we have established internal review and approval processes to mitigate these risks we may not be sure that all open source software is submitted for approval prior to use in our products many of the risks associated with usage of open source may not be eliminated and may if not properly addressed harm our business 

our intellectual property rights are valuable and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products services and brand 

our patents trademarks trade secrets copyrights and other intellectual property rights are important assets for us we aggressively protect our intellectual property rights by relying on federal state and common law rights in the us and internationally as well as a variety of administrative procedures we also rely on contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary rights in products and services the efforts that we take to protect our proprietary rights may not always be sufficient or effective protecting our intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming and may not be successful in every location any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business our brand and our ability to compete 

policing unauthorized use and copying of our products is difficult expensive and time consuming current us laws that prohibit copying give us only limited practical protection from software piracy and the laws of many other countries provide 

 20 

tables of contents 

very little protection we frequently encounter unauthorized copies of our software being sold through online marketplaces although we continue to evaluate and put in place technology solutions to attempt to lessen the impact of piracy and engage in efforts to educate consumers and public policy leaders on these issues and cooperate with industry groups in their efforts to combat piracy we expect piracy to be a persistent problem that results in lost revenues and increased expenses 

because competition for our key employees is intense we may not be able to attract retain and develop the highly skilled employees we need to support our planned growth 

much of our future success depends on the continued service and availability of skilled personnel including members of our executive team and those in technical marketing and staff positions experienced personnel in the software mobile technologies data security and software as a service industries are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense especially in california and india where the majority of our employees are located also as we strive to continue to adapt to technological change and introduce new and enhanced products and business models we must be able to secure maintain and develop the right quality and quantity of engaged and committed talent although we strive to be an employer of choice we may not be able to continue to successfully attract retain and develop key personnel which may cause our business to suffer 

as our product and service offerings become more tightly integrated we may be required to recognize the related revenue over relatively longer periods of time 

our expanding range of products and services and the combinations in which we offer them generate different revenue streams than our traditional desktop software businesses and the accounting policies that apply to revenue from these offerings are complex for example as we offer more online services bundled with software products we may be required to defer a higher percentage of our software product revenue into future fiscal periods in addition as we offer more services on a subscription basis we recognize revenue from those services over the periods in which the services are provided this may result in significant shifts of revenue from quarter to quarter or from one fiscal year to the next 

the nature of our products and services necessitates timely product launches and if we experience significant product quality problems or delays it may harm our revenue earnings and reputation 

all of our tax products and many of our nontax products have rigid development timetables that increase the risk of errors in our products and the risk of launch delays our tax preparation software product development cycle is particularly challenging due to the need to incorporate unpredictable tax law and tax form changes each year and because our customers expect high levels of accuracy and a timely launch of these products to prepare and file their taxes by the tax filing deadline due to the complexity of our products and the condensed development cycles under which we operate our products sometimes contain “bugs” that may unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the software the complexity of our products may also make it difficult for us to consistently deliver offerings that contain the features functionality and level of accuracy that our customers expect when we encounter problems we may be required to modify our code distribute patches to customers who have already purchased the product and recall or repackage existing product inventory in our distribution channels if we encounter development challenges or discover errors in our products late in our development cycle it may cause us to delay our product launch date any major defects or launch delays may lead to loss of customers and revenue negative publicity customer and employee dissatisfaction reduced retailer shelf space and promotions and increased operating expenses such as inventory replacement costs legal fees or payments resulting from our commitment to reimburse penalties and interest paid by customers due solely to calculation errors in our consumer tax preparation products 

our businesses are highly seasonal and our quarterly results could fluctuate significantly 

several of our businesses are highly seasonal which historically has caused significant quarterly fluctuations in our financial results revenue and operating results are usually strongest during the second and third fiscal quarters ending january 31 and april 30 due to our tax businesses contributing most of their revenue during those quarters and the timing of the release of our small business software products and upgrades we typically experience lower revenues and operating losses in the first and fourth quarters ending october 31 and july 31 our financial results may also fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year due to a variety of factors including changes in product sales mix that affect average selling prices product release dates the timing of delivery of federal and state tax forms any delay in our ability to successfully submit electronically filed tax returns with government agencies changes in consumer behavior the timing of our discontinuation of support for older product offerings changes to our bundling strategy such as the inclusion of upgrades with certain offerings changes to how we communicate the availability of new functionality in the future any of which may impact the pattern of revenue recognition and the timing of acquisitions divestitures and goodwill and acquired intangible asset impairment charges any fluctuations in our operating results may adversely affect our stock price

tables of contents 

we are frequently a party to litigation and regulatory inquiries which could result in an unfavorable outcome and have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operation and cash flows 

we are subject to various legal proceedings claims and regulatory inquiries that have arisen out of the ordinary conduct of our business and are not yet resolved and additional claims and inquiries may arise in the future the number and significance of these claims and inquiries have increased as our businesses have evolved any proceedings claims or inquiries initiated by or against us whether successful or not may be time consuming result in costly litigation damage awards consent decrees injunctive relief or increased costs of business require us to change our business practices or products require significant amounts of management time result in diversion of significant operations resources or otherwise harm of business and future financial results 

adverse global economic conditions could harm our business and financial condition 

the onset or continuation of adverse macroeconomic developments could negatively affect our business and financial condition adverse global economic events have caused and could in the future cause disruptions and volatility in global financial markets and increased rates of default and bankruptcy and could impact consumer and small business spending in particular because the majority of our revenue is derived from sales within the us economic conditions in the us have an even greater impact on us than companies with a more diverse international presence challenging economic times could cause potential new customers not to purchase or to delay purchasing of our products and services and could cause our existing customers to discontinue purchasing or delay upgrades of our existing products and services thereby negatively impacting our revenues and future financial results decreased consumer spending levels could also reduce credit and debit card transaction processing volumes causing reductions in our payments revenue poor economic conditions and high unemployment have caused and could in the future cause a significant decrease in the number of tax returns filed which may have a significant effect on the number of tax returns we prepare and file in addition weakness in the enduser consumer and small business markets could negatively affect the cash flow of our distributors and resellers who could in turn delay paying their obligations to us which could increase our credit risk exposure and cause delays in our recognition of revenue or future sales to these customers any of these events could harm our business and our future financial results 

we regularly invest resources to update and improve our internal information technology systems and software platforms should our investments not succeed or if delays or other issues with new or existing internal technology systems and software platforms disrupt our operations our business could be harmed 

we rely on our network and data center infrastructure and internal technology systems for many of our development marketing operational support sales accounting and financial reporting activities we are continually investing resources to update and improve these systems and environments in order to meet existing as well as the growing and changing requirements of our business and customers if we experience prolonged delays or unforeseen difficulties in updating and upgrading our systems and architecture we may experience outages and may not be able to deliver certain offerings and develop new offerings and enhancements that we need to remain competitive such improvements and upgrades are often complex costly and time consuming in addition such improvements can be challenging to integrate with our existing technology systems or may uncover problems with our existing technology systems unsuccessful implementation of hardware or software updates and improvements could result in outages disruption in our business operations loss of revenue or damage to our reputation 

our international operations are subject to increased risks which may harm our business operating results and financial condition 

in addition to uncertainty about our ability to generate revenues from our foreign operations and expand into international markets there are risks inherent in doing business internationally including 

  22 

tables of contents 

 

violations of the complex foreign and us laws and regulations that apply to our international operations may result in fines criminal actions or sanctions against us our officers or our employees prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with these laws there can be no assurance that our employees contractors or agents will not violate our policies these risks inherent in our international operations and expansion increase our costs of doing business internationally and may result in harm to our business operating results and financial condition 

if actual product returns exceed returns reserves our future financial results may be harmed 

we ship more desktop software products to our distributors and retailers than we expect them to sell in order to reduce the risk that distributors or retailers may run out of products this is particularly true for our consumer tax products which have a short selling season and for which returns occur primarily in our fiscal third and fourth quarters like many software companies that sell their products through distributors and retailers we have historically accepted significant product returns we establish reserves against revenue for product returns in our financial statements based on estimated returns and we closely monitor product sales and inventory in the retail channel in an effort to maintain adequate reserves in the past returns have not differed significantly from these reserves however if we experience actual returns that significantly exceed reserves it may result in lower net revenue 

unanticipated changes in our income tax rates may affect our future financial results 

our future effective income tax rates may be favorably or unfavorably affected by unanticipated changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or by changes in tax laws or their interpretation in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes these continuous examinations may result in unforeseen taxrelated liabilities which may harm our future financial results 

amortization of acquired intangible assets and impairment charges may cause significant fluctuation in our net income 

our acquisitions have resulted in significant expenses including amortization and impairment of acquired technology and other acquired intangible assets and impairment of goodwill total costs and expenses in these categories were approximately 99 million in fiscal 2013  33 million in fiscal 2012  and 50 million in fiscal 2011  although under current accounting rules goodwill is not amortized we may incur impairment charges related to the goodwill already recorded and to goodwill arising out of future acquisitions we test the impairment of goodwill annually in our fourth fiscal quarter or more frequently if indicators of impairment arise the timing of the formal annual test may result in charges to our statement of operations in our fourth fiscal quarter that may not have been reasonably foreseen in prior periods the total costs and expenses for fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2011 included goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges of 46 million and 30 million respectively that reduced the carrying value of our intuit health goodwill and intangible assets to zero we recorded the goodwill and intangible assets for that reporting unit on our balance sheet in may 2010 in connection with our acquisition of medfusion inc at july 31 2013  we had 12 billion  in goodwill and 149  million in net acquired intangible assets on our balance sheet both of which may be subject to impairment charges in the future new acquisitions and any impairment of the value of acquired intangible assets may have a significant negative impact on our future financial results 

our acquisition and divestiture activities may disrupt our ongoing business may involve increased expenses and may present risks not contemplated at the time of the transactions 

we have acquired and may continue to acquire companies products and technologies that complement our strategic direction acquisitions involve significant risks and uncertainties including

we have divested and may in the future divest certain assets or businesses that no longer fit with our strategic direction or growth targets divestitures involve significant risks and uncertainties including 

 

because acquisitions and divestitures are inherently risky our transactions may not be successful and may in some cases harm our operating results or financial condition although we typically fund our acquisitions through cash available from operations if we were to use debt to fund acquisitions or for other purposes our interest expense and leverage would increase significantly and if we were to issue equity securities as consideration in an acquisition current shareholders’ percentage ownership and earnings per share would be diluted 

we have 500 million in debt outstanding and may incur other debt in the future which may adversely affect our financial condition and future financial results 

in fiscal 2007 we issued 500 million in senior unsecured notes due in march 2012 and 500 million in senior unsecured notes due in march 2017 we repaid the march 2012 notes when they became due using cash from operations as the march 2017 debt matures we will have to expend significant resources to either repay or refinance these notes if we decide to refinance the notes we may be required to do so on different or less favorable terms or we may be unable to refinance the notes at all both of which may adversely affect our financial condition 

we have also entered into a 500 million fiveyear revolving credit facility although we have no current plans to request any advances under this credit facility we may use the proceeds of any future borrowing for general corporate purposes including future acquisitions

this debt may adversely affect our financial condition and future financial results by among other things 

 

our current revolving credit facility imposes restrictions on us including restrictions on our ability to create liens on our assets and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur indebtedness and require us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios our ability to comply with these ratios may be affected by events beyond our control in addition our short and longterm debt includes covenants that may adversely affect our ability to incur certain liens or engage in certain types of sale and leaseback transactions if we breach any of the covenants under our short and longterm debt or our revolving credit facility and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders then subject to applicable cure periods any outstanding indebtedness may be declared immediately due and payable 

in addition changes by any rating agency to our credit rating may negatively impact the value and liquidity of both our debt and equity securities if our credit ratings are downgraded or other negative action is taken the interest rate payable by us under our revolving credit facility may increase in addition any downgrades in our credit ratings may affect our ability to obtain additional financing in the future and may affect the terms of any such financing

legal proceedings 

on january 13 2012 two putative class actions were filed against intuit inc in connection with our turbotax income tax preparation software smith v intuit inc  us district court northern district of california and quildon v intuit inc  california superior court santa clara county the plaintiffs in both cases had asserted that the fees charged for the refund processing service offered within turbotax are “refund anticipation loans” and the disclosures about those fees do not comply with california and federal laws the smith  case was brought in federal court on behalf of a proposed nationwide class and subclasses the quildon  case was brought in state court on behalf of a proposed california class and subclasses in january 2013 for the purposes of settlement and without any admission of wrongdoing or liability intuit reached an agreement in principle to resolve all claims raised in the smith and quildon matters for an amount that is not material to our consolidated financial statements we accrued that amount in the second quarter of fiscal 2013 the terms of the proposed settlement are subject to the approval of the court which could approve reject or suggest modifications to those terms we currently believe that the likelihood of a material change to the proposed settlement amount is remote   

intuit is subject to certain routine legal proceedings as well as demands claims and threatened litigation that arise in the normal course of our business including assertions that we may be infringing patents or other intellectual property rights of others we currently believe that in addition to any amounts accrued the amount of potential losses if any for any pending

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda includes the following sections 

 

you should note that this mda discussion contains forwardlooking statements that involve risks and uncertainties please see the section entitled “forwardlooking statements and risk factors”  at the beginning of item 1a for important information to consider when evaluating such statements 

you should read this mda in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes in item 8 of this report in fiscal 2010 we acquired mint software inc and in fiscal 2012 we acquired demandforce inc we have included the results of operations for each of them in our consolidated results of operations from their respective dates of acquisition 

we have reclassified our financial statements for all periods presented to reflect our intuit real estate solutions intuit websites intuit financial services and intuit health businesses as discontinued operations see “results of operations – nonoperating income and expense – discontinued operations”  later in this item 7 for more information unless otherwise noted the following discussion pertains only to our continuing operations 

executive overview 

this overview provides a high level discussion of our operating results and some of the trends that affect our business we believe that an understanding of these trends is important in order to understand our financial results for fiscal 2013  as well as our future prospects this summary is not intended to be exhaustive nor is it intended to be a substitute for the detailed discussion and analysis provided elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

industry trends and seasonality 

the industry in which we operate is dynamic and highly competitive and we expect it to remain so in the future the markets for software and related services especially highlyavailable connected services are characterized by rapid technological change shifting customer needs and frequent new product introductions and enhancements competition and expertise in many of the markets we serve particularly small business services and consumer tax have grown over the past few years and we expect this trend to continue there are also large cloudbased service companies who innovate quickly and serve small businesses and consumers while today our competition with such companies may be limited as we and those companies grow 

 31 

tables of contents 

our competition with them may increase in recent years the widespread availability of the internet the emergence of mobile devices and the explosion of social media have accelerated the pace of change and revolutionized the way that people throughout the world manage important financial tasks the result is a global market that is shifting from traditional services that are paperbased humanproduced and brickandmortar bound to one where people understand demand and embrace the benefits of connected services this trend toward connected services is the primary driver of the strategies in all of our businesses 

our quickbooks consumer tax and accounting professionals offerings are highly seasonal revenue from our quickbooks software products tends to be highest during our second and third fiscal quarters sales of income tax preparation products and services are heavily concentrated in the period from november through april in our consumer tax business a greater proportion of our revenue has been occurring later in this seasonal period due in part to the growth in sales of turbotax online for which revenue is recognized upon printing or electronic filing of a tax return the seasonality of our consumer tax and accounting professionals revenue is also affected by the timing of the availability of tax forms from taxing agencies and the ability of those agencies to receive electronic tax return submissions delays in the availability of tax forms or the ability of taxing agencies to receive submissions can cause revenue to shift between our fiscal quarters these seasonal patterns mean that our total net revenue is usually highest during our second quarter ending january 31 and third quarter ending april 30 we typically report losses in our first quarter ending october 31 and fourth quarter ending july 31 during these quarters revenue from our tax businesses is minimal while core operating expenses such as research and development continue at relatively consistent levels we believe the seasonality of our revenue and profitability is likely to continue in the future 

key challenges and risks 

our growth strategy depends upon our ability to initiate and embrace disruptive technology trends to enter new markets and to drive broad adoption of the products and services we develop and market our future growth also increasingly depends on the strength of our thirdparty business relationships and our ability to continue to develop maintain and strengthen new and existing relationships to remain competitive and continue to grow we are investing significant resources in our product development marketing and sales capabilities and we expect to continue to do so in the future 

as we continue transitioning to offer more connected services the ongoing operation and availability of our information technology and communication systems and those of our external service providers is becoming increasingly important because we help customers manage their financial lives we face risks associated with the hosting collection use and retention of personal customer information and data we are investing significant management attention and resources in our information technology infrastructure and in our privacy and security capabilities and we expect to continue to do so in the future 

for a complete discussion of the most significant risks and uncertainties affecting our business please see “forwardlooking statements and risk factors”  in item 1a of this report 

overview of financial results 

total net revenue for fiscal 2013  was 42 billion  an increase of 10  compared with fiscal 2012  our small business group and our consumer tax segment were the key drivers of revenue growth revenue in our small business group increased 16  compared with fiscal 2012  due to growth in connected services offerings and our may 2012 acquisition of demandforce revenue in our consumer tax segment increased 4  compared with fiscal 2012  due to 4 growth in paid federal units 

operating income from continuing operations increased 6  in fiscal 2013  compared with fiscal 2012  due to higher revenue partially offset by higher costs and expenses operating expenses were higher due to increases in staffing expenses and to a lesser extent to increases in expenses for advertising and other marketing programs and sharebased compensation net income from continuing operations increased 8  in fiscal 2013  compared with fiscal 2012  due to higher operating income and lower interest expense diluted net income per share from continuing operations for fiscal 2013  increased 8  to 272  in line with the increase in net income compared with fiscal 2012  

we ended fiscal 2013  with cash cash equivalents and investments totaling 17 billion  in fiscal 2013  we generated cash from operations from the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans and from the sale of our intuit websites business during the same period we used cash for the repurchase of shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs the payment of cash dividends net purchases of investment securities and capital expenditures at july 31 2013  we had authorization from our board of directors to expend up to an additional 14 billion for stock repurchases through august 15 2014 on august 19 2013 our board approved a new stock repurchase program under which we are authorized to repurchase up to an additional 2 billion of our common stock from time to time over a fouryear period ending on august 19 2017

critical accounting policies and estimates 

in preparing our financial statements we make estimates assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on our net revenue operating income or loss and net income or loss as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our balance sheet we believe that the estimates assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies senior management has reviewed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and their disclosure in this annual report on form 10k with the audit and risk committee of our board of directors 

revenue recognition 

we derive revenue from the sale of packaged software products software subscriptions hosted services technical support plans financial supplies implementation services transaction fees merchant services hardware and multiple element arrangements that may include a combination of these items we follow the appropriate revenue recognition rules for each type of revenue for additional information see “revenue recognition”  in note 1 to the financial statements in item 8 of this report we generally recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists we have delivered the product or performed the service the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable however determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves exercising judgment and using estimates that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report for example for multiple element arrangements containing only software and softwarerelated elements we must exercise judgment and use estimates in order to 1 allocate the total price among the various elements we must deliver 2 determine whether undelivered services are essential to the functionality of the delivered products and services 3 determine whether vendorspecific evidence of fair value exists for each undelivered element and 4 determine whether and when each element has been delivered for multiple element arrangements containing nonsoftware elements we must exercise judgment and use estimates in order to 1 determine whether and when each element has been delivered 2 determine the fair value of each element using the selling price hierarchy of vendorspecific evidence vsoe of fair value if available thirdparty evidence tpe if vsoe is not available and estimated selling price esp if neither vsoe nor tpe is available and 3 allocate the total price among the various elements based on the relative selling price method if we were to change any of these judgments or estimates it could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period amounts for fees collected or invoiced and due relating to arrangements where revenue cannot be recognized are reflected on our balance sheet as deferred revenue and recognized when the applicable revenue recognition criteria are satisfied 

in connection with the sale of certain products we provide a limited amount of free technical support assistance to customers we do not defer the recognition of any revenue associated with sales of these products since the cost of providing this free technical support is insignificant the technical support is generally provided within one year after the associated revenue is recognized and free product enhancements are minimal and infrequent we accrue the estimated cost of providing this free support upon product shipment 

return and rebate reserves 

as part of our revenue recognition policy we estimate future product returns and rebate payments and establish reserves against revenue at the time of sale based on these estimates our return policy allows distributors and retailers subject to contractual limitations to return purchased products product returns by distributors and retailers relate primarily to the return of excess and obsolete products in determining our product returns reserves we consider the volume and price mix of products in the retail channel historical return rates for prior releases of the product trends in retailer inventory and economic trends that might impact customer demand for our products including the competitive environment and the timing of new releases of our products we fully reserve for excess and obsolete products in the distribution channels 

our rebate reserves include distributor and retailer sales incentive rebates and enduser rebates our estimated reserves for distributor and retailer incentive rebates are based on distributors’ and retailers’ actual performance against the terms and conditions of rebate programs which we typically establish annually our reserves for enduser rebates are estimated based on the terms and conditions of the specific promotional rebate program actual sales during the promotion and historical redemption trends by product and by type of promotional program 

in the past actual returns and rebates have not differed significantly from the reserves that we have established however actual returns and rebates in any future period are inherently uncertain if we were to change our assumptions and estimates our revenue reserves would change which would impact the net revenue we report if actual returns and rebates are significantly greater than the reserves we have established the actual results would decrease our future reported revenue conversely if actual returns and rebates are significantly less than our reserves this would increase our future reported

tables of contents 

revenue for example if we had increased our fiscal 2013  returns reserves by 1 of nonconsignment sales to retailers for quickbooks turbotax and quicken our total net revenue for fiscal 2013  would have been approximately 3 million lower 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

we make ongoing assumptions relating to the collectibility of our accounts receivable the accounts receivable amounts presented on our balance sheets include reserves for accounts that might not be paid in determining the amount of these reserves we consider our historical level of credit losses we also make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations and we assess current economic trends that might impact the level of credit losses in the future our reserves have generally been adequate to cover our actual credit losses however since we cannot reliably predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers we cannot guarantee that our reserves will continue to be adequate if actual credit losses are significantly greater than the reserve we have established that would increase our general and administrative expenses and reduce our reported net income conversely if actual credit losses are significantly less than our reserve this would eventually decrease our general and administrative expenses and increase our reported net income we had a total of 168  million in gross accounts receivable and an allowance for doubtful accounts of 38  million on our balance sheet at july 31 2013  

fair value of investments and otherthantemporary impairments 

as described in note 2 to the financial statements in item 8 of this report we estimate the fair value of our availableforsale debt and equity securities each quarter availableforsale debt securities consist of cash equivalents municipal bonds us treasury securities us agency securities corporate notes and municipal auction rate securities availableforsale equity securities consist of shares of a single publicly traded company fair value is defined as the price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date when identical or similar assets are traded in active markets the level of judgment required to estimate their fair value is relatively low this is generally true for our cash equivalents and our corporate equity securities which we consider to be level 1 assets and our municipal bonds us agency securities and corporate notes which we consider to be level 2 assets we measure the fair values of our level 2 investments with the help of a pricing service that either provides quoted market prices in active markets for identical or similar securities or uses observable inputs for their pricing without applying significant adjustments our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure that we record appropriate fair values for our level 2 investments these controls include comparison to pricing provided by a secondary pricing service or investment manager validation of pricing sources and models review of key model inputs analysis of periodoverperiod price fluctuations and independent recalculation of prices where appropriate 

significant judgment is required to estimate the fair value of assets and liabilities when observable inputs are not available level 3 for example we use a discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of our municipal auction rate securities because we have determined that the market for those securities is inactive at july 31 2013  we held a total of 33 million in municipal auction rate securities which was not significant compared with total availableforsale debt securities of 860 million  at that date 

we record unrealized gains and losses on our availableforsale securities net of income taxes in other comprehensive income in the equity section of our balance sheet until the security is sold or we determine that the decrease in fair value is otherthantemporary we consider a number of factors in determining whether to recognize an impairment charge including the reason for the decrease in fair value the severity of the decrease in fair value the length of time that the fair value has been less than the cost basis of the security the financial condition and nearterm prospects of the issuer and whether we intend to sell or may be required to sell the security before anticipated recovery of our cost basis changes in our estimates of the fair values of our availableforsale securities may result in material increases or decreases in our net income in the period in which the change occurs 

business combinations 

as described in “description of business and summary of significant accounting policies — business combinations”  in note 1 to the financial statements in item 8 of this report under the acquisition method of accounting we generally recognize the identifiable assets acquired the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interests in an acquiree at their fair values as of the date of acquisition we measure goodwill as the excess of consideration transferred which we also measure at fair value over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed the acquisition method of accounting requires us to exercise judgment and make significant estimates and assumptions regarding the fair values of the elements of a business combination as of the date of acquisition including the fair values of identifiable intangible assets deferred tax asset valuation allowances liabilities related to uncertain tax positions and contingencies this method also requires us to refine these estimates over a oneyear measurement period to reflect new information obtained about facts and 

 34 

tables of contents 

circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that if known would have affected the measurement of the amounts recognized as of that date if we are required to retroactively adjust provisional amounts that we have recorded for the fair values of assets and liabilities in connection with acquisitions these adjustments could materially decrease our operating income and net income and result in lower asset values on our balance sheet 

significant estimates and assumptions that we must make in estimating the fair value of acquired technology customer lists and other identifiable intangible assets include future cash flows that we expect to generate from the acquired assets if the subsequent actual results and updated projections of the underlying business activity change compared with the assumptions and projections used to develop these values we could record impairment charges in addition we have estimated the economic lives of certain acquired assets and these lives are used to calculate depreciation and amortization expense if our estimates of the economic lives change depreciation or amortization expenses could be accelerated or slowed 

goodwill acquired intangible assets and other longlived assets — impairment assessments 

we estimate the fair value of acquired intangible assets and other longlived assets that have finite useful lives whenever an event or change in circumstances indicates that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable we test for potential impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives annually in our fourth fiscal quarter or whenever indicators of impairment arise the timing of the annual test may result in charges to our statement of operations in our fourth fiscal quarter that could not have been reasonably foreseen in prior periods 

as described in “description of business and summary of significant accounting policies – goodwill acquired intangible assets and other longlived assets”  in note 1 to the financial statements in item 8 of this report in order to estimate the fair value of goodwill we use a weighted combination of a discounted cash flow model known as the income approach and comparisons to publicly traded companies engaged in similar businesses known as the market approach the income approach requires us to use a number of assumptions including market factors specific to the business the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows to be generated by the business over an extended period of time longterm growth rates for the business and a rate of return that considers the relative risk of achieving the cash flows and the time value of money we evaluate cash flows at the reporting unit level and the number of reporting units that we have identified may make impairment more probable than it would be at a company with fewer reporting units and more integrated operations following acquisitions although the assumptions we use in our discounted cash flow model are consistent with the assumptions we use to generate our internal strategic plans and forecasts significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of future cash flows from each reporting unit and the relative risk of achieving those cash flows when using the market approach we make judgments about the comparability of publicly traded companies engaged in similar businesses we base our judgments on factors such as size growth rates profitability risk and return on investment we also make judgments when adjusting market multiples of revenue operating income and earnings for these companies to reflect their relative similarity to our own businesses we had a total of 12 billion  in goodwill for continuing operations and 914 million in goodwill for discontinued operations on our balance sheet at july 31 2013  see note 5 to the financial statements in item 8 of this report for a summary of goodwill by reportable segment and note 8 for more information on goodwill for discontinued operations 

we estimate the recoverability of acquired intangible assets and other longlived assets that have finite useful lives by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows that we expect the asset to generate in order to estimate the fair value of those assets we estimate the present value of future cash flows from those assets the key assumptions that we use in our discounted cash flow model are the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows to be generated by the asset over an extended period of time and a rate of return that considers the relative risk of achieving the cash flows and the time value of money significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of future cash flows and the relative risk of achieving those cash flows we also make judgments about the remaining useful lives of acquired intangible assets and other longlived assets that have finite lives we had a total of  149 million  in net acquired intangible assets on our balance sheet at july 31 2013  

assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives are complex and often subjective they can be affected by a variety of factors including external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts for example if our future operating results do not meet current forecasts or if we experience a sustained decline in our market capitalization that is determined to be indicative of a reduction in fair value of one or more of our reporting units we may be required to record future impairment charges for goodwill and acquired intangible assets impairment charges could materially decrease our future net income and result in lower asset values on our balance sheet

during the fourth quarters of fiscal 2013 and 2012 we performed our annual goodwill impairment tests using the methodology described in “description of business and summary of significant accounting policies – goodwill acquired intangible assets and other longlived assets”  in note 1 to the financial statements in part 8 of this report we determined that the estimated fair values of all of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values and that they were not impaired in addition during this analysis we concluded that the estimated fair values of all of our reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying values 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 we performed our annual goodwill impairment test as described in note 1 in step one of that test we compared the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value the estimated fair values of all of our reporting units except intuit health exceeded their carrying values and we concluded that they were not impaired during this analysis we also concluded that the estimated fair values of all of our reporting units except intuit health substantially exceeded their carrying values we completed step two of the test for our intuit health reporting unit and determined that the goodwill and acquired intangible assets associated with it were impaired consequently we recorded a goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge of approximately 30  million in fiscal 2011 the market for online patienttoprovider communication solutions is dynamic and competition is intense circumstances that negatively affected our estimate of the fair value of our intuit health reporting unit included unforeseen delays in developing high quality timely offerings and marketing them effectively in march 2013 the largest customer for our intuit health business acquired a company that offers similar solutions and competes with us directly in that market space as a result we performed an interim impairment test of goodwill and acquired intangible assets during the third quarter of fiscal 2013 we concluded that the carrying amounts of goodwill and certain definitelived acquired intangible assets associated with our intuit health business were impaired and recorded an impairment charge of approximately 46 million that reduced the carrying value of those assets to zero see “ fair value measurements  assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis”  in note 2 to the financial statements in item 8 of this report for more information in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 management approved a plan to sell our intuit health business and we accounted for it as discontinued operations on august 19 2013 we completed the sale for cash consideration that was not significant intuit health was part of our other businesses reportable segment 

accounting for sharebased compensation plans 

at july 31 2013  there was 351  million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested sharebased compensation arrangements granted under all equity compensation plans which we will amortize to expense in the future total unrecognized compensation cost will be adjusted for future changes in estimated forfeitures we expect to recognize that cost over a weighted average vesting period of 23  years 

we use a lattice binomial model and the assumptions described in note 12 to the financial statements in item 8 of this report to estimate the fair value of stock options granted we estimate the expected term of options granted based on implied exercise patterns using a binomial model we estimate the volatility of our common stock at the date of grant based on the implied volatility of publicly traded oneyear and twoyear options on our common stock our decision to use implied volatility is based upon the availability of actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility we base the riskfree interest rate that we use in our option valuation model on the implied yield in effect at the time of option grant on constant maturity us treasury issues with equivalent remaining terms in fiscal 2012 we began paying quarterly cash dividends and as a result we began using an annualized expected dividend yield in our option valuation model we estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates we use historical data to estimate prevesting option forfeitures and record sharebased compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest we amortize the fair value of options on a straightline basis over the requisite service periods of the awards which are generally the vesting periods we may elect to use different assumptions under our option valuation model in the future which could materially affect our net income or loss and net income or loss per share 

restricted stock units rsus granted typically vest based on continued service we value these timebased rsus at the date of grant using the intrinsic value method adjusted for estimated forfeitures we amortize the fair value of timebased rsus on a straightline basis adjusted for estimated forfeitures over the service period certain rsus granted to senior management vest based on the achievement of preestablished performance or market goals we estimate the fair value of performancebased rsus at the date of grant using the intrinsic value method and the probability that the specified performance criteria will be met adjusted for estimated forfeitures each quarter we update our assessment of the probability that the specified performance criteria will be achieved and adjust our estimate of the fair value of the performancebased rsus if necessary we amortize the fair values of performancebased rsus over the requisite service period adjusted for estimated forfeitures for each separately vesting tranche of the award we estimate the fair value of marketbased rsus at the date of grant using a monte carlo valuation methodology and amortize those fair values over the requisite service period adjusted for estimated forfeitures for each separately vesting tranche of the award the monte carlo methodology that we use to estimate the fair value of marketbased rsus at the date of grant incorporates into the valuation the possibility that the market condition may not be satisfied

tables of contents 

provided that the requisite service is rendered the total fair value of the marketbased rsus at the date of grant must be recognized as compensation expense even if the market condition is not achieved however the number of shares that ultimately vest can vary significantly with the performance of the specified market criteria beginning in july 2012 all of the rsus we grant have dividend rights that are subject to the same vesting requirements as the underlying equity awards so we do not adjust the intrinsic market value of our rsus for dividends see note 12 to the financial statements in item 8 of this report for more information 

legal contingencies 

we are subject to certain legal proceedings as well as demands claims and threatened litigation that arise in the normal course of our business we review the status of each significant matter quarterly and assess our potential financial exposure if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated we record a liability and an expense for the estimated loss if we determine that a loss is possible and the range of the loss can be reasonably determined then we disclose the range of the possible loss significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination of whether an exposure is reasonably estimable our accruals are based on the best information available at the time as additional information becomes available we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates potential legal liabilities and the revision of estimates of potential legal liabilities could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 

income taxes — estimates of deferred taxes valuation allowances and uncertain tax positions 

we estimate our income taxes based on the various jurisdictions where we conduct business significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax rules and the potential for future adjustment of our uncertain tax positions by the united states internal revenue service or other taxing jurisdictions we estimate our current tax liability and assess temporary differences that result from differing treatments of certain items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which we show on our balance sheet we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized to the extent we believe that realization is not likely we establish a valuation allowance when we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in an accounting period we record a corresponding tax expense in our statement of operations 

at july 31 2013  we had net deferred tax assets of 170 million  which included a valuation allowance of 25 million for the benefits of federal and state net basis difference in investments held for sale state capital and operating loss carryforwards and state tax credit carryforwards we recorded the valuation allowance to reflect uncertainties about whether we will be able to utilize some of our deferred tax assets before they expire while we believe our current valuation allowance is sufficient we could in the future be required to increase the valuation allowance to take into account additional deferred tax assets that we may be unable to realize we assess the need for an adjustment to the valuation allowance on a quarterly basis the assessment is based on our estimates of future sources of taxable income for the jurisdictions in which we operate and the periods over which our deferred tax assets will be realizable see note 11 to the financial statements in item 8 of this report for more information 

we recognize and measure benefits for uncertain tax positions using a twostep approach the first step is to evaluate the tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon audit including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes for tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely of being realized upon settlement significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions we evaluate our uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis our evaluations are based upon a number of factors including changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law correspondence with tax authorities during the course of audits and effective settlement of audit issues changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in material increases or decreases in our income tax expense in the period in which we make the change which could have a material impact on our effective tax rate and operating results

liquidity and capital resources 

overview 

at july 31 2013  our cash cash equivalents and investments totaled 17 billion  an increase of 917  million from july 31 2012  due to the factors described in “statements of cash flows”  below our primary source of liquidity has been cash from operations which entails the collection of accounts receivable for products and services our primary uses of cash have been for research and development programs selling and marketing activities capital projects acquisitions of businesses debt service costs repurchases of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs and the payment of cash dividends as discussed in “executive overview – industry trends and seasonality”  earlier in this item 7 our business is subject to significant seasonality the balance of our cash cash equivalents and investments generally fluctuates with that seasonal pattern we believe the seasonality of our business is likely to continue in the future 

the following table summarizes selected measures of our liquidity and capital resources at the dates indicated 



we have historically generated significant cash from operations and we expect to continue to do so during fiscal 2014  since our operations are primarily domestic approximately 90 of our cash cash equivalents and investments at july 31 2013  were located in the us and none of those funds were restricted our only significant debt consists of 500 million in senior unsecured notes due in march 2017 we also have an unused 500 million unsecured revolving line of credit facility available to us for general corporate purposes including future acquisitions 

we evaluate on an ongoing basis the merits of acquiring technology or businesses or establishing strategic relationships with and investing in other companies our strong liquidity profile enables us to respond nimbly to these kinds of opportunities 

based on past performance and current expectations we believe that our cash and cash equivalents investments and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet anticipated seasonal working capital needs capital expenditure

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

investment portfolio 

there has been significant deterioration and instability in the financial markets since 2008 this period of extraordinary disruption and readjustment in the financial markets has exposed us to investment risks beyond those typically inherent in investment securities the value and liquidity of the securities in which we invest could deteriorate rapidly and the issuers of these securities could be subject to credit rating downgrades in light of the current market conditions and these additional risks we actively monitor market conditions and developments specific to the securities in which we invest we believe that we take a conservative approach to investing our funds in that we invest only in highlyrated securities and diversify our portfolio of investments while we believe we take prudent measures to mitigate investment related risks such risks cannot be fully eliminated because of market circumstances that are outside our control 

our investments consist of instruments that meet quality standards that are consistent with our investment policy this policy specifies that except for direct obligations of the united states government securities issued by agencies of the united states government and money market funds we diversify our investments by limiting our holdings with any individual issuer we do not hold derivative financial instruments or european sovereign debt in our portfolio of investments see note 3 to the financial statements in item 8 of this report for a summary of the amortized cost and fair value of our investments by type of issue 

the following table presents our portfolio of cash equivalents and availableforsale debt securities as of july 31 2013  by stated maturity the table is classified by the original maturity date listed on the security and includes cash equivalents which consist primarily of money market funds at july 31 2013  the weighted average tax adjusted interest rate earned on our money market accounts was 003  and the weighted average tax adjusted interest rate earned on our investments was 037  



interest rate risk 

our cash equivalents and investments are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates interest rate movements affect the interest income we earn on cash equivalents and investments and the value of those investments should the federal reserve target rate increase by 25 basis points from the level of july 31 2013  the value of our investments would decrease by approximately 3  million should the federal reserve target rate increase by 100 basis points from the level of july 31 2013  the value of our investments would decrease by approximately 10 million 

we are also exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates as they affect our 500 million revolving credit facility advances under the credit facility accrue interest at rates that are equal to jp morgans alternate base rate plus a margin that ranges from 00  to 05  or the london interbank offered rate libor plus a margin that ranges from 09  to 15  in both cases based on our senior debt ratings consequently our interest expense would fluctuate with changes in the general level of these interest rates if we were to borrow any amounts under the credit facility at july 31 2013  no amounts were outstanding under the credit facility 

on march 12 2007 we issued 500 million of 575 senior unsecured notes due on march 15 2017 we carry these senior notes at face value less unamortized discount on our balance sheets since these senior notes bear interest at fixed rates we have no financial statement risk associated with changes in interest rates however the fair value of these notes fluctuates when interest rates change see note 2 and note 10 to the financial statements in item 8 of this report for more information

impact of foreign currency rate changes 

the functional currencies of our international operating subsidiaries are generally the local currencies we translate the assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries at the exchange rates in effect on the balance sheet date we translate their revenue costs and expenses at the average rates of exchange in effect during the period we include translation gains and losses in the stockholders’ equity section of our balance sheets we include net gains and losses resulting from foreign exchange transactions in interest and other income in our statements of operations 

since we translate foreign currencies primarily canadian dollars british pounds australian dollars indian rupees and singapore dollars into us dollars for financial reporting purposes currency fluctuations can have an impact on our financial results the historical impact of currency fluctuations has generally been immaterial we believe that our exposure to currency exchange fluctuation risk is not significant primarily because our global subsidiaries invoice customers and satisfy their financial obligations almost exclusively in their local currencies although the impact of currency fluctuations on our financial results has generally been immaterial in the past and we believe that for the reasons cited above currency fluctuations will not be significant in the future there can be no guarantee that the impact of currency fluctuations will not be material in the future as of july 31 2013  we did not engage in foreign currency hedging activities

product development 

since the markets for software and related services are characterized by rapid technological change shifting customer needs and frequent new product introductions and enhancements a continuous high level of investment is required to innovate and quickly develop new products and services as well as enhance existing offerings our product development efforts are becoming more important than ever as we pursue our connected services strategy which reflects a world where people and businesses are increasingly connected by technology and expect access to services at any time in any place 

we develop many of our products and services internally we have a number of united states and foreign patents and pending applications that relate to various aspects of our products and technology we supplement our internal development efforts by acquiring or licensing products and technology from third parties and establishing other relationships that enable us to enhance or expand our offerings more rapidly we expect to expand our third party technology relationships as we continue to pursue our connected services strategy 

our traditional core desktop software products — quickbooks turbotax lacerte proseries and quicken — tend to have predictable annual development and product release cycles we also develop innovative new offerings such as gopayment snap payroll snaptax mint mobile our mobile banking apps and other mobile applications for which development cycles can be more rapid developing consumer and professional tax software and services presents unique challenges because of the demanding development cycle required to accurately incorporate tax law and tax form changes within a rigid timetable the development timing for our payroll merchant services financial institutions and patienttoprovider communication offerings varies with business needs and regulatory requirements and the length of the development cycle depends on the scope and complexity of each project 

in our financial services business we have developed interfaces with the systems of many of the major providers of core processing software and services to financial institutions these system interfaces leverage a common platform allowing us to access a financial institution’s host system to provide end users access to their account data we are enhancing many of our existing interfaces including mobile and tablet access in order to deliver more robust connectivity and increase operating efficiencies we also continue to develop new functionality such as single destination page and extending payments capabilities for financial institutions and their end users 

we continue to make substantial investments in research and development and we expect to focus our future research and development efforts on enhancing existing products and services and on developing new products and services including new mobile and global offerings we also expect to continue to focus significant research and development efforts on ongoing projects to update the technology platforms for several of our offerings our research and development expenses were 669  million or 16  of total net revenue in fiscal 2012  620 million or 16  of total net revenue in fiscal 2011  and 564 million or 17  of total net revenue in fiscal 2010  

seasonality 

our quickbooks consumer tax and accounting professionals businesses are highly seasonal revenue from our quickbooks software products tends to be highest during our second and third fiscal quarters sales of income tax preparation products and services are heavily concentrated in the period from november through april in our consumer tax business a greater proportion of our revenue has been occurring later in this seasonal period due in part to the growth in sales of turbotax online for which revenue is recognized upon printing or electronic filing of a tax return the seasonality of our consumer tax and accounting professionals revenue is also affected by the timing of the availability of tax forms from taxing agencies and the ability of those agencies to receive electronic tax return submissions delays in the availability of tax forms or the ability of taxing agencies to receive submissions can cause revenue to shift between our fiscal quarters these seasonal patterns mean 

tables of contents 

that our total net revenue is usually highest during our second quarter ending january 31 and third quarter ending april 30 we typically report losses in our first quarter ending october 31 and fourth quarter ending july 31 when revenue from our tax businesses is minimal while core operating expenses such as research and development continue at relatively consistent levels we believe the seasonality of our revenue and profitability is likely to continue in the future 

marketing sales and distribution channels 

markets 

our primary target customers are small businesses consumers accounting professionals and financial institutions the markets in which we compete have always been characterized by rapid technological change shifting customer needs and frequent new product introductions and enhancements by competitors over the past several years the widespread availability of the internet mobile devices and the explosion of social media have accelerated the pace of change and revolutionized the way that customers learn about evaluate and purchase products and services 

realtime personalized online and mobile shopping experiences are rapidly becoming the standard in addition many customers now begin shopping in one channel and ultimately purchase in another this creates a need for integrated multichannel shopandbuy experiences market and industry changes quickly make existing products and services obsolete our success depends on our ability to respond rapidly to these changes with new business models updated competitive strategies new or enhanced products and services alternative distribution methods and other changes in the way we do business 

our target customers for online and mobile banking services are mediumsized financial institutions seeking an outsourced solution that allows them to compete with the larger national banks in their market we also provide online and mobile financial management solutions to financial institution customers of core processors

our financial services business focuses its marketing efforts on identifying potential financial institution clients and marketing our online and mobile banking services to consumer end users in cooperation with our financial institution clients we also work with these financial institutions to provide their customers with other intuit products and services such as turbotax for online banking 

sales and distribution channels

direct sales channel  we sell many of our products and services for small businesses consumers and accounting professionals directly through our websites and call centers telesales continues to be an effective channel for serving customers that want live help to select the products and services that are right for their needs 

our financial services business sells its products and services to financial institutions using a direct sales model and to a lesser but increasing extent in cooperation with core processing partners our typical sales cycle is approximately nine to 18 months for new financial institutions and four to six months for addon sales to existing customers 

retail channel  we sell our quickbooks turbotax and quicken desktop software as well as payroll services and merchant credit card payment processing services at retail locations across the united states we sell these products and services directly

app stores   we distribute many of our offerings for mobile devices through proprietary online stores that provide applications for specific devices these include the apple app store which provides apps for the apple iphone and ipad and google’s play store which provides apps for androidcompatible smartphones and tablets 

other channels  we have strategies to address the alliance partner solution provider and personal computer hardware manufacturer channels revenue from these channels is currently less significant than revenue from our direct and retail channels but it is growing we sell our consumer and small business products and services through selected alliance partners primarily banks credit unions and securities and investment firms these alliance partners help us reach new customers at the point of transaction and drive growth and market share by extending our online reach solution providers combine our products and services with valueadded marketing sales and technical expertise to deliver a complete solution at the local level relationships with selected personal computer hardware manufacturers help us attract new customers for our core software offerings as we expand our mobile and global offerings we expect that strategic partnerships will become increasingly important to our business for example we are marketing and selling some of our offerings through mobile phone service and hardware providers 

our financial services business has joint marketing arrangements with several core processing vendors they include fiserv inc open solutions inc fidelity information services inc and computer services inc to deliver bill payment and bill presentment services to our financial institution customers we also maintain valueadded reseller relationships with major providers such as fidelity information services and fiserv 

competition 

overview 

we face intense competition in all of our businesses both domestically and internationally competitive interest and expertise in many of the markets we serve particularly small business consumer tax and online and mobile banking have grown markedly over the past few years and we expect this trend to continue some of our existing competitors have significantly greater financial technical and marketing resources than we do in addition the competitive landscape can shift rapidly as new companies enter markets in which we compete this is particularly true for online and mobile products and services where the barriers to entry are lower than they are for desktop software products and services to attract customers many online and mobile competitors are offering free or lowpriced entrylevel products which we must take into account in our pricing strategies 

our most obvious competition comes from other companies that offer technology solutions similar to ours however for many of our products and services other important competitive alternatives for customers are third party service providers such as professional accountants and seasonal assisted tax preparation businesses manual tools and processes or generalpurpose software are also important competitive alternatives many of our new customers previously used pencil and paper or software such as word processors and spreadsheets rather than competitors’ software and services to perform financial tasks we believe that there is a longterm trend away from manual methods and toward the use of digital methods such as desktop and online software and mobile devices to accomplish these tasks that will continue to provide growth opportunities 

competition specific to business segments 

small business group  our quickbooks desktop product is the leading small business financial management software in the us retail channel our small business products and services face competitive challenges from companies such as the sage group plc which offers software and associated services that directly target small business customers increasingly our small business products and services also face competition from free or lowcost online accounting offerings as well as free online banking and bill payment services offered by financial institutions and others in our payroll business we compete directly with automatic data processing inc adp paychex and many other companies with payroll offerings including online payroll offerings in our merchant services business we compete directly with large financial institutions such as wells fargo jp morgan chase and bank of america and with many payment processors including first data corporation elavon global payments and fiscertegy 

tables of contents 

consumer tax  our future growth depends on our ability to attract new customers to the selfpreparation tax category from tax stores and other seasonal assisted tax preparers in the private sector we face intense competition from hr block which provides assisted tax preparation services in its stores and a competing software offering called hr block at home we also face competition from several other large assisted tax preparation service providers from a myriad of small seasonal tax preparers and from numerous online selfpreparation offerings including 2nd story software’s taxact these competing offerings subject us to significant price pressure 

we also face competitive challenges in our consumer tax business from publicly funded government entities that offer electronic tax preparation and filing services at no cost to individual taxpayers we are a member of the free file alliance a consortium of private sector companies that has entered into an agreement with the federal government under this agreement the member companies provide online federal tax preparation and filing services at no cost to eligible federal taxpayers and the federal government has agreed not to provide a competing service approximately 20 states have also adopted free file alliance publicprivate agreements while approximately 20 other states offer some form of direct government tax preparation and filing services free to qualified taxpayers we continue to actively work with others in the private and public sectors to advance the goals of the free file alliance policy initiative and to support successful publicprivate partnerships however future administrative regulatory or legislative activity in this area could harm our consumer tax business 

accounting professionals  our lacerte professional tax offerings face competition from competitivelypriced tax and accounting solutions that include integration with nontax functionality these include cch’s prosystems fx office suite and thomson reuters’ cs professional suite and gosystems tax our proseries professional tax offerings face competition from cch’s atx and taxwise offerings we also face growing competition from online tax and accounting offerings which may be marketed more effectively or have lower pricing than our offerings for accounting professionals 

financial services  the market for digital online and mobile banking services is highly competitive in the area of consumer online banking a number of companies offer online banking services to financial institutions including online resources aci worldwide inc q2ebanking fundsxpress a subsidiary of first data corporation and yodlee inc in addition several companies whose primary offerings are core processing or bill payment processing services also provide online banking services these companies include fiserv inc open solutions inc fidelity information services inc and jack henry and associates inc in addition many of these firms offer our products through a referral or reseller arrangement with us we also compete for new customers with relatively recent entrants into the online financial management solutions market as we negotiate service contract renewals with current customers competitive pressures may require us to make concessions on pricing and other material terms as part of the negotiation 

competitive factors 

we believe the most important competitive factors for our core offerings — quickbooks turbotax lacerte proseries and quicken — are ease of use product features size of the installed customer base brand name recognition value proposition cost reliability and product and support quality access to distribution channels is also important for our quickbooks turbotax and quicken software products in addition support from accounting professionals and the ability for customers to upgrade within product families as their businesses grow are significant competitive factors for our quickbooks products productivity is an important competitive factor for the fullservice accounting firms to which we market our lacerte software products we believe we compete effectively on these factors as our quickbooks turbotax and quicken products are the leading products in the us retail sales channel for their respective categories 

for our service offerings such as small business payroll merchant payment processing outsourced online and mobile banking and patienttoprovider communication solutions features and ease of use the integration of these products with related software brand name recognition effective distribution quality of support cost and scalability of operations are important competitive factors 

customer service and technical support 

we provide customer service and technical support by telephone email online chat text messaging online communities and our customer service and technical support websites we have fulltime and outsourced customer service and technical support staffs we supplement these staffs with seasonal employees and additional outsourcing during periods of peak call volumes such as during the tax return filing season or following a major product launch we outsource to several firms domestically and internationally most of our internationally outsourced consumer and small business customer service and technical support personnel are currently located in india and the philippines 

tables of contents 

we offer free selfhelp information through our technical support websites for our quickbooks turbotax accounting professionals and quicken software products customers can use our websites to find answers to commonly asked questions and check on the status of orders under certain support plans customers can also use our websites to receive product updates electronically support alternatives and fees vary by product we also sponsor online user communities such as intuit community for small businesses and accounting professionals and turbotax live community where consumers can share knowledge and product advice with each other beginning with the 2011 tax season we began offering free tax advice from usbased tax professionals to turbotax users 

manufacturing and distribution 

desktop software and supplies 

the key processes in manufacturing desktop software are manufacturing compact discs cds printing boxes and related materials and assembling and shipping the final products 

for retail manufacturing we have an agreement with arvato digital services inc adis a division of bertelsmann ag under which adis provides a majority of the manufacturing volume for our launches of quickbooks turbotax and quicken as well as for daytoday replenishment after product launches adis has operations in multiple locations that can provide redundancy if necessary we also have an agreement with jvc america inc under which jvc provides secondary outsourced manufacturing volume for these launches and for daytoday replenishment 

for retail distribution we have an agreement with adis under which adis handles all logistics services our retail product launches are operationally complex our model for product delivery for retail launches and replenishment is a hybrid of direct to store deliveries and shipments to central warehouse locations this allows improved inventory management by our retailers we also ship products for many of our smaller retail customers through distributors 

adis also provides most of the manufacturing volume and distribution services for our direct desktop software orders we have an exclusive agreement with harland clarke a division of mf worldwide corporation to fulfill orders for all of our printed checks and most other products for our financial supplies business 

we have multiple sources for all of our raw materials and availability has historically not been a significant problem for us 

prior to major product releases for our core desktop software products we tend to have significant levels of backlog but at other times backlog is minimal and we typically ship products within a few days of receiving an order because of this fluctuation in backlog we believe that backlog is not a reliable predictor of our future core desktop software sales 

online products and services 

intuit’s data centers house most of the systems networks and databases required to operate and deliver our online products and services these include quickbooks online online payroll services merchant payment processing services online customer marketing and communication services for small businesses turbotax online intuit tax online consumer and professional electronic tax filing services outsourced online and mobile banking services and mint through our data centers we connect customers to our products and services and store customer and business information as our businesses continue to move toward delivering more online and mobile products and services in conjunction with our connected services strategy we expect that our infrastructure will become even more critical to our business in the future 

our primary data center is located at a facility we own in washington state and we have a primary backup facility at a colocated data center in nevada we also have a number of other data centers that are primarily located in the western united states we continue to execute on a multiyear plan to transition to fewer data centers in more geographically diverse locations 

privacy and security of customer information and transactions 

we are subject to various federal state and international laws and regulations and to financial institution requirements relating to the privacy and security of customer and employee personal information we are also subject to laws and regulations that apply to the internet behavioral tracking mobile applications telemarketing email activities data hosting and retention financial and health information and credit reporting additional laws in all of these areas are likely to be passed in the future which could result in significant limitations on or changes to the ways in which we can collect use host store or transmit the 

tables of contents 

personal information and data of our customers or employees communicate with our customers and deliver products and services or may significantly increase our compliance costs as our business expands to new industry segments and new uses of data that are regulated for privacy and security or to countries outside the united states that have strict data protections laws our compliance requirements and costs will increase 

through a master privacy policy framework designed to be consistent with globally recognized privacy principles we comply with united states federal and other country guidelines and practices to help ensure that customers and employees are aware of and can control how we use information about them our primary websites such as quickbookscom and turbotaxcom have been certified by truste an independent organization that operates a website privacy certification program representing industry standard practices to address users’ and regulators’ concerns about online privacy we also use privacy statements to provide notice to customers of our privacy practices as well as provide them the opportunity to furnish instructions with respect to use of their personal information we participate in industry groups whose purpose is to develop or influence industry best practices and to influence public policy for privacy and security 

to address security concerns we use security safeguards to help protect the systems and the information customers give to us from loss misuse and unauthorized alteration whenever customers transmit sensitive information such as a credit card number or tax return data to us through one of our websites we use industry standards to encrypt the data as it is transmitted to us we work to protect our systems from unauthorized internal or external access using numerous commercially available computer security products as well as internally developed security procedures and practices 

government regulation 

the financial services industry is subject to extensive and complex federal and state regulation our financial institution customers which include commercial banks and credit unions operate in markets that are subject to rigorous regulatory oversight and supervision the compliance of our products and services with these requirements depends on a variety of factors including the particular functionality the interactive design and the charter or license of the financial institution our financial services customers must independently assess and determine what is required of them under these regulations and are responsible for ensuring that our systems and the design of their websites conform to their regulatory obligations 

our intuit financial services business is not directly subject to federal or state regulations specifically applicable to financial institutions such as banks and credit unions however as a provider of services to financial institutions this business is examined by the federal financial institution examination council under the information technology examination guidelines although we believe we are not subject to direct supervision by federal and state banking agencies with regard to other regulations we have from time to time agreed to examinations of our business and operations by these agencies 

our consumer tax and accounting professionals businesses are also subject to federal and state government requirements including regulations related to the electronic filing of tax returns the provision of tax preparer assistance and the use and disclosure of customer information in addition we offer certain other products and services such as small business payroll merchant payment processing services prepaid debit cards and patienttoprovider communication solutions which are subject to special regulatory requirements as we expand our products and services we may become subject to additional government regulation new laws or regulations may be adopted that could impose significant limitations on our business and increase our cost of compliance we continually analyze new business opportunities both domestically and internationally and new businesses and business models that we pursue may require additional costs for regulatory compliance 

we are subject to federal and state laws and government regulations concerning employee safety and health and environmental matters the occupational safety and health administration the environmental protection agency and other federal and state agencies have the authority to put regulations in place that may have an impact on our operations 

intellectual property 

our success depends on the proprietary technology embodied in our offerings we protect this proprietary technology by relying on a variety of intellectual property mechanisms including copyright patent trade secret and trademark laws restrictions on disclosure and other methods for example we regularly file applications for patents copyrights and trademarks and service marks in order to protect intellectual property that we believe is important to our business we hold a small but growing patent portfolio that we believe is important to intuits overall competitive advantage although we are not materially dependent on any one patent or particular group of patents in our portfolio at this time we also have a number of registered trademarks that include intuit quickbooks turbotax lacerte proseries quicken and mint we have registered these and 

tables of contents 

other trademarks and service marks in the united states and depending on the relevance of each brand to other markets in many foreign countries most registrations can be renewed perpetually at 10year intervals we also license intellectual property from third parties for use in our products 

although our portfolio of patents is growing the patents that have been issued to us could be determined to be invalid and may not be enforceable against competitive products in every jurisdiction in addition third parties have asserted and may in the future assert infringement claims against us and our customers these claims and any litigation may result in invalidation of our proprietary rights or a finding of infringement along with an assessment of damages litigation even if without merit could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention in addition third party licenses may not continue to be available to us on commercially acceptable terms or at all 

employees 

as of july 31 2012  we had approximately 8500  employees in major offices in the united states canada india the united kingdom and other locations we believe our future success and growth will depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees in all areas of our business we do not currently have any collective bargaining agreements with our employees and we believe employee relations are generally good although we have employmentrelated agreements with a number of key employees these agreements do not guarantee continued service we believe we offer competitive compensation and a good working environment we were named one of fortune  magazine’s “100 best companies to work for” in each of the last eleven years however we face intense competition for qualified employees and we expect to face continuing challenges in recruiting and retention

risk factors 

forwardlooking statements and risk factors 

this annual report on form 10k contains forwardlooking statements all statements in this report other than statements that are purely historical are forwardlooking statements words such as “expect” “anticipate” “intend” “plan” “believe” “forecast” “estimate” “seek” and similar expressions also identify forwardlooking statements in this report forwardlooking statements include without limitation the following 

 

we caution investors that forwardlooking statements are only predictions based on our current expectations about future events and are not guarantees of future performance we encourage you to read carefully all information provided in this report and in our other filings with the sec before deciding to invest in our stock or to maintain or change your investment these forwardlooking statements are based on information as of the filing date of this annual report and we undertake no obligation to revise or update any forwardlooking statement for any reason 

because forwardlooking statements involve risks and uncertainties there are important factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forwardlooking statements these factors include the following 

we face intense competitive pressures that may harm our operating results 

we face intense competition in all of our businesses and we expect competition to remain intense in the future our competitors and potential competitors range from large and established entities to emerging startups our competitors may introduce superior products and services reduce prices have greater technical marketing and other resources have greater name recognition have larger installed bases of customers have wellestablished relationships with our current and potential customers advertise aggressively or beat us to market with new products and services in addition we may face competition from existing companies with large established consumer userbases and broadbased platforms who may change or expand the focus of their business strategies and target our customers such as small businesses and financial institutions we also face 

tables of contents 

intensified competition from providers of free accounting tax payments banking and other financial services in order to compete we have also introduced free offerings in several categories but we may not be able to attract customers or effectively monetize all of these offerings and customers who have formerly paid for intuit’s products and services may elect to use free offerings instead these competitive factors may diminish our revenue and profitability and harm our ability to acquire and retain customers 

our consumer tax business also faces significant competition from the public sector where we face the risk of federal and state taxing authorities developing software or other systems to facilitate tax return preparation and electronic filing at no charge to taxpayers these or similar programs may be introduced or expanded in the future which may cause us to lose customers and revenue although the free file alliance has kept the federal government from being a direct competitor to intuit’s tax offerings it has fostered additional online competition and may cause us to lose significant revenue opportunities the current agreement with the free file alliance is scheduled to expire in october 2014 we anticipate that governmental encroachment at both the federal and state levels may present a continued competitive threat to our business for the foreseeable future 

future revenue growth depends upon our ability to adapt to technological change and successfully introduce new and enhanced products services and business models 

the software as a service desktop software and mobile technology industries are characterized by rapidly changing technology evolving industry standards and frequent new product introductions as we continue to grow our software as a service mobile and other offerings we must continue to innovate and develop new products and features to meet changing customer needs and attract and retain talented software developers we need to continue to develop our skills tools and capabilities to capitalize on existing and emerging technologies which require us to devote significant resources 

a number of our businesses also derive a significant amount of their revenue from onetime upfront license fees and rely on customer upgrades and service offerings to generate a significant portion of their revenues in addition our consumer and professional tax businesses depend significantly on revenue from customers who return each year to use our updated tax preparation and filing software and services as our existing products mature encouraging customers to purchase product upgrades becomes more challenging unless new product releases provide features and functionality that have meaningful incremental value if we are not able to develop and clearly demonstrate the value of new or upgraded products or services to our customers our revenues may be harmed in addition as we continue to introduce and expand our new business models including offerings that are subscriptionbased or that are free to end users we may be unsuccessful in monetizing or increasing customer adoption of these offerings 

the number of people who access products and services through devices other than personal computers including mobile phones smartphones and handheld computers such as tablets has increased dramatically in the past few years we have limited experience to date in developing products and services for users of these alternative devices and the versions of our products and services developed for these devices may not be compelling to users even if we are able to attract new users through these mobile offerings the amount of revenue that we derive per user from mobile offerings may be less than the revenue that we have historically derived from users of personal computers as new devices and new platforms are continually being released it is difficult to predict the problems we may encounter in developing versions of our products and services for use on these alternative devices and we may need to devote significant resources to the creation support and maintenance of such offerings if we are slow to develop products and technologies that are compatible with these alternative devices of if our competitors are able to achieve those results more quickly than us we will fail to capture a significant share of an increasingly important portion of the market for online services which could adversely affect our business 

in some cases we may expend a significant amount of resources and management attention on offerings that do not ultimately succeed in their markets we have encountered difficulty in launching new products and services in the past if we misjudge customer needs in the future our new products and services may not succeed and our revenues and earnings may be harmed we have also invested and in the future expect to invest in new business models geographies strategies and initiatives such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties including distraction of management from current operations expenses associated with the initiatives and inadequate return on investments because these new initiatives are inherently risky they may not be successful and may harm our financial condition and operating results 

business interruption or failure of our information technology and communication systems may impair the availability of our products and services which may damage our reputation and harm our future financial results 

as we continue to transition our business to more connected services we become more dependent on the continuing operation and availability of our information technology and communication systems and those of our external service providers we do not have redundancy for all of our systems many of our critical applications reside in only one of our data centers and our 

tables of contents 

disaster recovery planning may not account for all eventualities we also do not maintain realtime backup of all our data and in the event of significant system disruption we may experience loss of data or processing capabilities which may cause us to lose customers and may materially harm our reputation and our operating results in addition we are in the process of updating our customer facing applications and the supporting information technology infrastructure to meet our customers’ expectations for continuous service availability any difficulties in upgrading these applications or infrastructure or failure of our systems or those of our service providers may result in interruptions in our service which may reduce our revenues and profits cause us to lose customers and damage our reputation any prolonged interruptions at any time may result in lost customers additional refunds of customer charges negative publicity and increased operating costs any of which may significantly harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are in the process of migrating our applications and infrastructure to new data centers if we do not execute the transition to the new data centers in an effective manner we may experience unplanned service disruptions or unforeseen increases in costs which may harm our operating results and our business 

our business operations data centers information technology and communications systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters human error malicious attacks fire power loss telecommunications failures computer viruses computer denial of service attacks terrorist attacks and other events beyond our control the majority of our research and development activities our corporate headquarters our principal information technology systems and other critical business operations are located near major seismic faults we do not carry earthquake insurance for direct quakerelated losses our future financial results may be materially harmed in the event of a major earthquake or other natural or manmade disaster 

we rely on internal systems and external systems maintained by manufacturers distributors and other service providers to take and fulfill customer orders handle customer service requests and host certain online activities any interruption or failure of our internal or external systems may prevent us or our service providers from accepting and fulfilling customer orders or cause company and customer data to be unintentionally disclosed our continuing efforts to upgrade and expand our network security and other information systems as well as our highavailability capabilities may be costly and problems with the design or implementation of system enhancements may harm our business and our results of operations 

our hosting collection use and retention of personal customer information and data create risk that may harm our business 

a number of our businesses collect use and retain large amounts of personal customer information and data including credit card numbers tax return information bank account numbers and passwords personal and business financial data social security numbers healthcare information and payroll information we may also develop new business models that use certain personal information or data derived from personal information in addition we collect and maintain personal information of our employees in the ordinary course of our business some of this personal customer and employee information is held and some transactions are executed by third parties in addition as many of our products and services are webbased and mobile applicationbased the amount of data we store for our users on our servers and the servers of our vendors that provide hosting services including personal information has been increasing and will continue to increase as we further transition our businesses to connected services we and our vendors use commercially available security technologies to protect transactions and personal information we use security and business controls to limit access and use of personal information and require our vendors to implement similar controls however we may not have the ability to effectively monitor the implementation of the security measures of our vendors and in any event individuals or third parties may be able to circumvent these security and business measures and errors in the storage use or transmission of personal information may result in a breach of customer or employee privacy or theft of assets which may require notification under applicable data privacy regulations we employ contractors temporary and seasonal employees who may have access to the personal information of customers and employees or who may execute transactions in the normal course of their duties while we conduct background checks of our employees and other individuals and limit access to systems and data it is possible that one or more of these individuals may circumvent these controls resulting in a security breach 

we are subject to laws rules and regulations relating to the collection use and security of user data new laws in this area have been passed by several jurisdictions and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions these new laws may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and our current data protection policies and practices may not be consistent with those interpretations and applications in addition the ability to execute transactions and the possession and use of personal information and data in conducting our business subjects us to legislative and regulatory burdens that may require notification to customers or employees of a security breach restrict our use of personal information and hinder our ability to acquire new customers or market to existing customers as our business continues to expand to new industry segments that may be more highly regulated for privacy and data security and to countries outside the united states that have more strict data protection laws our compliance requirements and costs may increase we have incurred — and may 

tables of contents 

continue to incur — significant expenses to comply with mandatory privacy and security standards and protocols imposed by law regulation industry standards or contractual obligations 

a major breach of our security measures or those of third parties that provide hosting services for us execute transactions or hold and manage personal information may have serious negative consequences for our businesses including possible fines penalties and damages reduced customer demand for our services harm to our reputation and brands further regulation and oversight by federal or state agencies and loss of our ability to provide financial transaction services or accept and process customer credit card orders or tax returns from time to time we detect or receive notices from customers or public or private agencies that they have detected vulnerabilities in our servers our software or thirdparty software components that are distributed with our products the existence of vulnerabilities even if they do not result in a security breach may harm customer confidence and require substantial resources to address and we may not be able to discover or remediate such security vulnerabilities before they are exploited in addition hackers develop and deploy viruses worms and other malicious software programs that may attack our offerings although this is an industrywide problem that affects software across platforms it is increasingly affecting our offerings because hackers tend to focus their efforts on the more popular programs and offerings and we expect them to continue to do so if hackers were able to circumvent our security measures or if we were unable to detect an intrusion into our systems and contain such intrusion in a reasonable amount of timewe may lose personal information although we have commercially available network and application security internal control measures and physical security procedures to safeguard our systems there can be no assurance that a security breach intrusion loss or theft of personal information will not occur which may harm our business customer reputation and future financial results and may require us to expend significant resources to address these problems including notification under data privacy regulations 

if we are unable to develop manage and maintain critical third party business relationships our business may be adversely affected 

our growth is dependent on the strength of our business relationships and our ability to continue to develop maintain and leverage new and existing relationships we rely on various third party partners including software and service providers suppliers vendors manufacturers distributors contractors financial institutions core processors licensing partners and development partners among others in many areas of our business in order to deliver our offerings and operate our business we also rely on third parties to support the operation of our business by maintaining our physical facilities equipment power systems and infrastructure in certain instances these third party relationships are sole source or limited source relationships and can be difficult to replace or substitute depending on the level of integration of the third party’s products or services into or with our offerings andor the general availability of such third party’s products and services in addition there may be few or no alternative third party providers or vendors in the market further there can be no assurance that we will be able to adequately retain third party contractors engaged to help us operate our business the failure of third parties to provide acceptable and high quality products services and technologies or to update their products services and technologies may result in a disruption to our business operations and our customers which may reduce our revenues and profits cause us to lose customers and damage our reputation alternative arrangements and services may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or we may experience business interruptions upon a transition to an alternative partner 

in particular we have relationships with banks credit unions or other financial institutions both as customers and as suppliers of certain critical services we offer to our other customers if macroeconomic conditions or other factors cause any of these institutions to fail consolidate stop providing certain services or institute costcutting efforts our business and financial results may suffer and we may be unable to offer those services to our customers 

we have also started to increasingly utilize the distribution platforms of third parties like apples app store and googles play store for the distribution of certain of our product offerings although we benefit from the strong brand recognition and large user base of these distribution platforms to attract new customers the platform owners have wide discretion to change the pricing structure terms of service and other policies with respect to us and other developers any adverse changes by these third parties could adversely affect our financial results     

increased government regulation of our businesses may harm our operating results 

many of our businesses are in highly regulated areas including our tax payroll payments financial services prepaid debit card and healthcare businesses there have been significant new regulations and heightened focus by the government on many of these areas in addition as we seek to grow our business we may expand into more highlyregulated businesses or countries which may subject us to increased regulatory scrutiny the application of these laws and regulations to our businesses is often unclear and compliance with these regulations may involve significant costs or require changes to our business practices that result in reduced revenue in addition new regulations or changes in current regulations may affect our operating results any 

tables of contents 

changes that we may incur as a result of any such regulations may not be sustained over time depending on a number of factors including market and industry reactions to such regulations 

in order to meet regulatory standards we may be required to increase investment in compliance and auditing functions or new technologies in addition government authorities may enact other laws rules or regulations that place new burdens or restrictions on our business or determine that our operations are directly subject to existing rules or regulations such as requirements related to data collection use transmission retentionprocessing and security which may make our business more costly less efficient or impossible to conduct and may require us to modify our current or future products or services which may harm our future financial results 

the tax preparation industry continues to receive heightened attention from federal and state governments new legislation regulation public policy considerations litigation by the government or private entities or new interpretations of existing laws may result in greater oversight of the tax preparation industry restrict the types of products and services that we can offer or the prices we can charge or otherwise cause us to change the way we operate our tax businesses or offer our tax products and services this in turn may increase our cost of doing business and limit our revenue opportunities in addition if our practices are not consistent with new interpretations of existing laws we may become subject to lawsuits penalties and other liabilities that did not previously apply we are also required to comply with a variety of state revenue agency standards in order to successfully operate our tax preparation and electronic filing services changes in stateimposed requirements by one or more of the states including the required use of specific technologies or technology standards may significantly increase the costs of providing those services to our customers and may prevent us from delivering a quality product to our customers in a timely manner 

our financial services business provides services to banks credit unions and other financial institutions that are subject to extensive and complex federal and state regulation as a result our financial institution customers require that our products and services comply with the regulations applicable to these customers if we are unable to comply with these regulations we may incur significant costs and penalties face litigation or governmental proceedings and lose our ability to sell to these customers any of these adverse events may harm our future financial results and our reputation 

if we fail to process transactions effectively or fail to adequately protect against disputed or potential fraudulent activities our revenue and earnings may be harmed 

our operations process a significant volume and dollar value of transactions on a daily basis especially in our payroll and payments businesses due to the size and volume of transactions that we handle effective processing systems and controls are essential to ensure that transactions are handled appropriately despite our efforts it is possible that we may make errors or that funds may be misappropriated due to fraud the systems supporting our business are comprised of multiple technology platforms that are difficult to scale if we are unable to effectively manage our systems and processes we may be unable to process customer data in an accurate reliable and timely manner which may harm our business in our payments processing service business if merchants for whom we process payment transactions are unable to pay refunds due to their customers in connection with disputed or fraudulent merchant transactions we may be required to pay those amounts and our payments may exceed the amount of the customer reserves we have established to make such payments 

the online tax preparation payroll administration and online payments industries have been experiencing an increasing amount of fraudulent activities by third parties although we do not believe that any of this activity is uniquely targeted at our business this type of fraudulent activity may adversely impact our own operations in our consumer tax payroll and payments businesses in addition to any direct damages and potential fines that may result from such fraud which may be substantial a loss of confidence in our controls may seriously harm our business and damage our brand as fraud detection and prevention abilities improve across the various industries in which we operate we may implement risk control mechanisms that could make it more difficult for legitimate customers to obtain and use our products as well as prevent the sale of our products to those parties seeking to facilitate fraudulent activity which could result in lost revenue and negatively impact our operating results 

  

third parties claiming that we infringe their proprietary rights may cause us to incur significant legal expenses and prevent us from selling our products 

as the number of products in the software industry increases and the functionality of these products further overlap and as we acquire technology through acquisitions or licenses we may become increasingly subject to infringement claims including patent copyright and trademark infringement claims litigation may be necessary to determine the validity and scope of the patent rights of others we have received an increasing number of allegations of patent infringement claims in the past and expect to receive more claims in the future based on allegations that our offerings infringe upon patents held by third parties 

tables of contents 

some of these claims are the subject of pending litigation against us and against some of our customers these claims may involve patent holding companies or other adverse patent owners who have no relevant product revenues of their own and against whom our own patents may provide little or no deterrence the ultimate outcome of any allegation is uncertain and regardless of outcome any such claim with or without merit may be time consuming to defend result in costly litigation divert management’s time and attention from our business require us to stop selling delay shipping or redesign our products or require us to pay monetary damages for royalty or licensing fees or to satisfy indemnification obligations that we have with some of our customers our failure to obtain necessary license or other rights or litigation arising out of intellectual property claims may harm our business 

we rely on third party intellectual property in our products and services 

many of our products and services include intellectual property of third parties which we license under agreements that must be renewed or renegotiated from time to time we may not be able to obtain licenses to these third party technologies or content on reasonable terms or at all if we are unable to obtain the rights necessary to use this intellectual property in our products and services we may not be able to sell the affected offerings and customers who are currently using the affected product may be disrupted which may in turn harm our future financial results damage our brand and result in customer loss also we and our customers have been and may continue to be subject to infringement claims as a result of the third party intellectual property incorporated in to our offerings although we try to mitigate this risk and we may not be ultimately liable for any potential infringement pending claims require us to use significant resources require management attention and could result in loss of customers 

some of our offerings include thirdparty software that is licensed under socalled “open source” licenses some of which may include a requirement that under certain circumstances we make available or grant licenses to any modifications or derivative works we create based upon the open source software although we have established internal review and approval processes to mitigate these risks we may not be sure that all open source software is submitted for approval prior to use in our products many of the risks associated with usage of open source may not be eliminated and may if not properly addressed harm our business 

our intellectual property rights are valuable and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products services and brand 

our patents trademarks trade secrets copyrights and other intellectual property rights are important assets for us we aggressively protect our intellectual property rights by relying on federal state and common law rights in the us and internationally as well as a variety of administrative procedures we also rely on contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary rights in products and services the efforts that we take to protect our proprietary rights may not always be sufficient or effective protecting our intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming and may not be successful in every location any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business our brand and our ability to compete 

policing unauthorized use and copying of our products is difficult expensive and time consuming current us laws that prohibit copying give us only limited practical protection from software piracy and the laws of many other countries provide very little protection we frequently encounter unauthorized copies of our software being sold through online marketplaces although we continue to evaluate and put in place technology solutions to attempt to lessen the impact of piracy and engage in efforts to educate consumers and public policy leaders on these issues and cooperate with industry groups in their efforts to combat piracy we expect piracy to be a persistent problem that results in lost revenues and increased expenses 

because competition for our key employees is intense we may not be able to attract retain and develop the highly skilled employees we need to support our planned growth 

much of our future success depends on the continued service and availability of skilled personnel including members of our executive team and those in technical marketing and staff positions experienced personnel in the software mobile technologies data security and software as a service industries are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense especially in california and india where the majority of our employees are located also as we strive to continue to adapt to technological change and introduce new and enhanced products and business models we must be able to secure maintain and develop the right quality and quantity of engaged and committed talent although we strive to be an employer of choice we may not be able to continue to successfully attract retain and develop key personnel which may cause our business to suffer 

tables of contents 

as our product and service offerings become more tightly integrated we may be required to recognize the related revenue over relatively longer periods of time 

our expanding range of products and services and the combinations in which we offer them generate different revenue streams than our traditional desktop software businesses and the accounting policies that apply to revenue from these offerings are complex for example as we offer more online services bundled with software products we may be required to defer a higher percentage of our software product revenue into future fiscal periods in addition as we offer more services on a subscription basis we recognize revenue from those services over the periods in which the services are provided this may result in significant shifts of revenue from quarter to quarter or from one fiscal year to the next 

the nature of our products and services necessitates timely product launches and if we experience significant product quality problems or delays it may harm our revenue earnings and reputation 

all of our tax products and many of our nontax products have rigid development timetables that increase the risk of errors in our products and the risk of launch delays our tax preparation software product development cycle is particularly challenging due to the need to incorporate unpredictable tax law and tax form changes each year and because our customers expect high levels of accuracy and a timely launch of these products to prepare and file their taxes by the tax filing deadline due to the complexity of our products and the condensed development cycles under which we operate our products sometimes contain “bugs” that may unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the software the complexity of our products may also make it difficult for us to consistently deliver offerings that contain the features functionality and level of accuracy that our customers expect when we encounter problems we may be required to modify our code distribute patches to customers who have already purchased the product and recall or repackage existing product inventory in our distribution channels if we encounter development challenges or discover errors in our products late in our development cycle it may cause us to delay our product launch date any major defects or launch delays may lead to loss of customers and revenue negative publicity customer and employee dissatisfaction reduced retailer shelf space and promotions and increased operating expenses such as inventory replacement costs legal fees or payments resulting from our commitment to reimburse penalties and interest paid by customers due solely to calculation errors in our consumer tax preparation products 

our businesses are highly seasonal and our quarterly results could fluctuate significantly 

several of our businesses are highly seasonal which historically has caused significant quarterly fluctuations in our financial results revenue and operating results are usually strongest during the second and third fiscal quarters ending january 31 and april 30 due to our tax businesses contributing most of their revenue during those quarters and the timing of the release of our small business software products and upgrades we typically experience lower revenues and operating losses in the first and fourth quarters ending october 31 and july 31 our financial results may also fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year due to a variety of factors including changes in product sales mix that affect average selling prices product release dates the timing of delivery of federal and state tax forms any delay in our ability to successfully submit electronically filed tax returns with government agencies changes in consumer behavior the timing of our discontinuation of support for older product offerings changes to our bundling strategy such as the inclusion of upgrades with certain offerings changes to how we communicate the availability of new functionality in the future any of which may impact the pattern of revenue recognition and the timing of acquisitions divestitures and goodwill and acquired intangible asset impairment charges any fluctuations in our operating results may adversely affect our stock price 

we are frequently a party to litigation and regulatory inquiries which could result in an unfavorable outcome and have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operation and cash flows 

we are subject to various legal proceedings claims and regulatory inquiries that have arisen out of the ordinary conduct of our business and are not yet resolved and additional claims and inquiries may arise in the future the number and significance of these claims and inquiries have increased as our businesses have evolved any proceedings claims or inquiries initiated by or against us whether successful or not may be time consuming result in costly litigation damage awards consent decrees injunctive relief or increased costs of business require us to change our business practices or products require significant amounts of management time result in diversion of significant operations resources or otherwise harm of business and future financial results 

the continued global economic downturn may harm our business and financial condition 

the continued global economic downturn has caused disruptions and extreme volatility in global financial markets and increased rates of default and bankruptcy and has impacted consumer and small business spending these macroeconomic developments have affected and may continue to negatively affect our business and financial condition in particular because the majority of our revenue is derived from sales within the us economic conditions in the us have an even greater impact 

tables of contents 

on us than companies with a more diverse international presence potential new customers may not purchase or delay purchase of our products and services and many of our existing customers may discontinue purchasing or delay upgrades of our existing products and services thereby negatively impacting our revenues and future financial results decreased consumer spending levels may also reduce credit and debit card transaction processing volumes causing reductions in our payments revenue poor economic conditions and high unemployment has caused and may continue to cause a significant decrease in the number of tax returns filed which may have a significant effect on the number of tax returns we prepare and file in addition weakness in the enduser consumer and small business markets may negatively affect the cash flow of our distributors and resellers who may in turn delay paying their obligations to us which may increase our credit risk exposure and cause delays in our recognition of revenue or future sales to these customers additionally if macroeconomic or other factors continue to cause banks credit unions mortgage lenders and other financial institutions to fail or result in further costcutting efforts or consolidation of these entities we may lose current or potential customers achieve less revenue per customer andor lose valuable relationships with such of these entities that provide critical services to our customers any of these events may harm our business and our future financial results 

we regularly invest resources to update and improve our internal information technology systems and software platforms should our investments not succeed or if delays or other issues with new or existing internal technology systems and software platforms disrupt our operations our business could be harmed 

we rely on our network and data center infrastructure and internal technology systems for many of our development marketing operational support sales accounting and financial reporting activities we are continually investing resources to update and improve these systems and environments in order to meet existing as well as the growing and changing requirements of our business and customers if we experience prolonged delays or unforeseen difficulties in updating and upgrading our systems and architecture we may experience outages and may not be able to deliver certain offerings and develop new offerings and enhancements that we need to remain competitive such improvements and upgrades are often complex costly and time consuming in addition such improvements can be challenging to integrate with our existing technology systems or may uncover problems with our existing technology systems unsuccessful implementation of hardware or software updates and improvements could result in outages disruption in our business operations loss of revenue or damage to our reputation 

our international operations are subject to increased risks which may harm our business operating results and financial condition 

in addition to uncertainty about our ability to generate revenues from our foreign operations and expand into international markets there are risks inherent in doing business internationally including 

 

violations of the complex foreign and us laws and regulations that apply to our international operations may result in fines criminal actions or sanctions against us our officers or our employees prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with these laws there can be no assurance that our employees contractors or agents will not violate our policies these risks inherent in our international operations and expansion increase our costs of doing business internationally and may result in harm to our business operating results and financial condition

if actual product returns exceed returns reserves our future financial results may be harmed 

we ship more desktop software products to our distributors and retailers than we expect them to sell in order to reduce the risk that distributors or retailers may run out of products this is particularly true for our consumer tax products which have a short selling season and for which returns occur primarily in our fiscal third and fourth quarters like many software companies that sell their products through distributors and retailers we have historically accepted significant product returns we establish reserves against revenue for product returns in our financial statements based on estimated returns and we closely monitor product sales and inventory in the retail channel in an effort to maintain adequate reserves in the past returns have not differed significantly from these reserves however if we experience actual returns that significantly exceed reserves it may result in lower net revenue 

unanticipated changes in our income tax rates may affect our future financial results 

our future effective income tax rates may be favorably or unfavorably affected by unanticipated changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or by changes in tax laws or their interpretation in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes these continuous examinations may result in unforeseen taxrelated liabilities which may harm our future financial results 

amortization of acquired intangible assets and impairment charges may cause significant fluctuation in our net income 

our acquisitions have resulted in significant expenses including amortization and impairment of acquired technology and other acquired intangible assets and impairment of goodwill total costs and expenses in these categories were approximately 53 million in fiscal 2012  85 million in fiscal 2011  and 85 million in fiscal 2010  although under current accounting rules goodwill is not amortized we may incur impairment charges related to the goodwill already recorded and to goodwill arising out of future acquisitions we test the impairment of goodwill annually in our fourth fiscal quarter or more frequently if indicators of impairment arise the timing of the formal annual test may result in charges to our statement of operations in our fourth fiscal quarter that may not have been reasonably foreseen in prior periods the total costs and expenses for fiscal 2011 included a goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge of 30  million for our intuit health reporting unit we recorded the goodwill and intangible assets for that reporting unit on our balance sheet in may 2010 in connection with our acquisition of medfusion inc at july 31 2012  we had 22 billion  in goodwill and 213  million in net acquired intangible assets on our balance sheet both of which may be subject to impairment charges in the future new acquisitions and any impairment of the value of acquired intangible assets may have a significant negative impact on our future financial results 

our acquisition and divestiture activities may disrupt our ongoing business may involve increased expenses and may present risks not contemplated at the time of the transactions 

we have acquired and may continue to acquire companies products and technologies that complement our strategic direction acquisitions involve significant risks and uncertainties including 

 

because acquisitions and divestitures are inherently risky our transactions may not be successful and may in some cases harm our operating results or financial condition although we typically fund our acquisitions through cash available from operations if we were to use debt to fund acquisitions or for other purposes our interest expense and leverage would increase significantly and if we were to issue equity securities as consideration in an acquisition current shareholders’ percentage ownership and earnings per share would be diluted 

tables of contents 

we have 500 million in debt outstanding and may incur other debt in the future which may adversely affect our financial condition and future financial results 

in fiscal 2007 we issued 500 million in senior unsecured notes due in march 2012 and 500 million in senior unsecured notes due in march 2017 we repaid the march 2012 notes when they became due using cash from operations as the march 2017 debt matures we will have to expend significant resources to either repay or refinance these notes if we decide to refinance the notes we may be required to do so on different or less favorable terms or we may be unable to refinance the notes at all both of which may adversely affect our financial condition 

we have also entered into a 500 million fiveyear revolving credit facility although we have no current plans to request any advances under this credit facility we may use the proceeds of any future borrowing for general corporate purposes including future acquisitions 

this debt may adversely affect our financial condition and future financial results by among other things 

 

our current revolving credit facility imposes restrictions on us including restrictions on our ability to create liens on our assets and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur indebtedness and require us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios our ability to comply with these ratios may be affected by events beyond our control in addition our short and longterm debt includes covenants that may adversely affect our ability to incur certain liens or engage in certain types of sale and leaseback transactions if we breach any of the covenants under our short and longterm debt or our revolving credit facility and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders then subject to applicable cure periods any outstanding indebtedness may be declared immediately due and payable 

in addition changes by any rating agency to our credit rating may negatively impact the value and liquidity of both our debt and equity securities if our credit ratings are downgraded or other negative action is taken the interest rate payable by us under our revolving credit facility may increase in addition any downgrades in our credit ratings may affect our ability to obtain additional financing in the future and may affect the terms of any such financing 

we are subject to risks associated with information disseminated through our services 

the laws relating to the liability of online services companies for information such as online content disseminated through their services are subject to frequent challenges in spite of settled law in the us claims are made against online services companies by parties who disagree with the content where our online content is accessed on the internet outside of the us challenges may be brought under foreign laws which do not provide the same protections for online services companies as in the us these challenges in either us or foreign jurisdictions may rise to legal claims alleging defamation libel invasion of privacy negligence copyright or trademark infringement or other theories based on the nature and content of the materials disseminated through the services certain of our services include content generated by users of our online services although this content is not generated by us claims of defamation or other injury may be made against us for that content any costs incurred as a result of this potential liability may harm our business

on january 13 2012 two putative class actions were filed against intuit inc in connection with our turbotax income tax preparation software smith v intuit inc  us district court northern district of california and quildon v intuit inc  california superior court santa clara county the plaintiffs in both cases assert that the fees charged for the refund processing service offered within turbotax are “refund anticipation loans” and the disclosures about those fees do not comply with california and federal laws the smith  case was brought in federal court on behalf of a proposed nationwide class and subclasses the quildon  case was brought in state court on behalf of a proposed california class and subclasses otherwise the two complaints are substantively identical in each case the plaintiffs seek monetary relief including restitution statutory damages treble damages and interest in an unspecified amount as well as attorneys fees and costs on february 22 2012 intuit removed the quildon case to federal court on march 16 2012 the plaintiffs filed a motion to remand the quildon case to state court on march 19 2012 intuit filed motions to dismiss the plaintiffs claims in both cases on may 25 2012 the federal court remanded the quildon case to state court and denied as moot the motion to dismiss that case on july 10 2012 intuit filed a motion in state court to stay the quildon case until the federal court resolves the smith case which the state court granted on august 6 2012 on september 10 2012 the federal court issued an order granting intuits motion to dismiss the plaintiffs complaint in the smith matter the plaintiffs have 30 days from the date of the order to file any amended complaint we continue to believe we have meritorious defenses to the claims asserted in these actions and intend to defend vigorously

against them we believe that liabilities associated with these cases while possible are not probable and therefore we have not recorded any accrual for them as of july 31 2012  further any possible range of loss cannot be reasonably estimated at this time 

intuit is subject to certain routine legal proceedings as well as demands claims and threatened litigation that arise in the normal course of our business including assertions that we may be infringing patents or other intellectual property rights of others we currently believe that in addition to any amounts accrued the amount of potential losses if any for any pending claims of any type either alone or combined will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements the ultimate outcome of any litigation is uncertain and regardless of outcome litigation can have an adverse impact on intuit because of defense costs negative publicity diversion of management resources and other factors our failure to obtain necessary license or other rights or litigation arising out of intellectual property claims could adversely affect our business

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda includes the following sections 

 

you should note that this mda discussion contains forwardlooking statements that involve risks and uncertainties please see the section entitled “forwardlooking statements and risk factors”  at the beginning of item 1a for important information to consider when evaluating such statements 

you should read this mda in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes in item 8 of this report in fiscal 2010 we acquired mint software inc and medfusion inc and in fiscal 2012 we acquired demandforce inc we have included the results of operations for each of them in our consolidated results of operations from their respective dates of acquisition 

we have reclassified our financial statements for all periods presented to reflect our intuit real estate solutions and intuit websites businesses as discontinued operations see “results of operations — discontinued operations”  later in this item 7 for more information unless otherwise noted the following discussion pertains only to our continuing operations 

executive overview 

this overview provides a high level discussion of our operating results and some of the trends that affect our business we believe that an understanding of these trends is important in order to understand our financial results for fiscal 2012  as well as our future prospects this summary is not intended to be exhaustive nor is it intended to be a substitute for the detailed discussion and analysis provided elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

overview of financial results 

total net revenue for fiscal 2012  was 42 billion  an increase of 10  compared with fiscal 2011  our small business group and our consumer tax segment were the key drivers of revenue growth revenue from our small business group increased 14  compared with fiscal 2011  due to growth in connected services offerings and improved offering mix revenue from our consumer tax segment increased 11  compared with fiscal 2011  due to 6 growth in paid federal units and favorable offering mix operating income from continuing operations increased 14  in fiscal 2012  compared with fiscal 2011  due to higher revenue partially offset by higher costs and expenses operating expenses were higher due to increases in staffing expenses and to a lesser extent increases in sharebased compensation expenses net income from continuing operations increased 18   

tables of contents 

in fiscal 2012  compared with fiscal 2011  due to the increase in operating income lower interest expense and a slightly lower effective tax rate diluted net income per share from continuing operations for fiscal 2012  increased 22  to 252  as a result of the increase in net income and the decline in weighted average diluted shares compared with fiscal 2011  

we ended fiscal 2012  with cash cash equivalents and investments totaling 744 million  in fiscal 2012  we generated cash from operations from net sales of investments and from the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans during the same period we used cash for the repurchase of shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs the repayment of debt the acquisition of demandforce inc the payment of cash dividends and capital expenditures at july 31 2012  we had authorization from our board of directors to expend up to an additional 17 billion for stock repurchases through august 15 2014 

seasonality 

our quickbooks consumer tax and accounting professionals offerings are highly seasonal revenue from our quickbooks software products tends to be highest during our second and third fiscal quarters sales of income tax preparation products and services are heavily concentrated in the period from november through april in our consumer tax business a greater proportion of our revenue has been occurring later in this seasonal period due in part to the growth in sales of turbotax online for which revenue is recognized upon printing or electronic filing of a tax return the seasonality of our consumer tax and accounting professionals revenue is also affected by the timing of the availability of tax forms from taxing agencies and the ability of those agencies to receive electronic tax return submissions delays in the availability of tax forms or the ability of taxing agencies to receive submissions can cause revenue to shift between our fiscal quarters these seasonal patterns mean that our total net revenue is usually highest during our second quarter ending january 31 and third quarter ending april 30 we typically report losses in our first quarter ending october 31 and fourth quarter ending july 31 when revenue from our tax businesses is minimal while core operating expenses such as research and development continue at relatively consistent levels we believe the seasonality of our revenue and profitability is likely to continue in the future 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

in preparing our financial statements we make estimates assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on our net revenue operating income or loss and net income or loss as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our balance sheet we believe that the estimates assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies senior management has reviewed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and their disclosure in this annual report on form 10k with the audit and risk committee of our board of directors 

revenue recognition 

we derive revenue from the sale of packaged software products software subscriptions hosted services technical support plans financial supplies implementation services transaction fees merchant services hardware and multiple element arrangements that may include a combination of these items we follow the appropriate revenue recognition rules for each type of revenue for additional information see “revenue recognition”  in note 1 to the financial statements in item 8 of this report we generally recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists we have delivered the product or performed the service the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable however determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves exercising judgment and using estimates that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report for example for multiple element arrangements containing only software and softwarerelated elements we must exercise judgment and use estimates in order to 1 allocate the total price among the various elements we must deliver 2 determine whether undelivered services are essential to the functionality of the delivered products and services 3 determine whether vendorspecific evidence of fair value exists for each undelivered element and 4 determine whether and when each element has been delivered for multiple element arrangements containing nonsoftware elements we must exercise judgment and use estimates in order to 1 determine whether and when each element has been delivered 2 determine the fair value of each element using the selling price hierarchy of vendorspecific evidence of fair value vsoe of fair value if available thirdparty evidence tpe if vsoe is not available and estimated selling price esp if neither vsoe nor tpe is available and 3 allocate the total price among the various elements based on the relative selling price method if we were to change any of these judgments or estimates it could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period amounts for fees collected or invoiced and due relating to arrangements where revenue cannot be recognized are reflected on our balance sheet as deferred revenue and recognized when the applicable revenue recognition criteria are satisfied 

tables of contents 

in connection with the sale of certain products we provide a limited amount of free technical support assistance to customers we do not defer the recognition of any revenue associated with sales of these products since the cost of providing this free technical support is insignificant the technical support is generally provided within one year after the associated revenue is recognized and free product enhancements are minimal and infrequent we accrue the estimated cost of providing this free support upon product shipment 

return and rebate reserves 

as part of our revenue recognition policy we estimate future product returns and rebate payments and establish reserves against revenue at the time of sale based on these estimates our return policy allows distributors and retailers subject to contractual limitations to return purchased products product returns by distributors and retailers relate primarily to the return of excess and obsolete products in determining our product returns reserves we consider the volume and price mix of products in the retail channel historical return rates for prior releases of the product trends in retailer inventory and economic trends that might impact customer demand for our products including the competitive environment and the timing of new releases of our products we fully reserve for excess and obsolete products in the distribution channels 

our rebate reserves include distributor and retailer sales incentive rebates and enduser rebates our estimated reserves for distributor and retailer incentive rebates are based on distributors’ and retailers’ actual performance against the terms and conditions of rebate programs which we typically establish annually our reserves for enduser rebates are estimated based on the terms and conditions of the specific promotional rebate program actual sales during the promotion and historical redemption trends by product and by type of promotional program 

in the past actual returns and rebates have not differed significantly from the reserves that we have established however actual returns and rebates in any future period are inherently uncertain if we were to change our assumptions and estimates our revenue reserves would change which would impact the net revenue we report if actual returns and rebates are significantly greater than the reserves we have established the actual results would decrease our future reported revenue conversely if actual returns and rebates are significantly less than our reserves this would increase our future reported revenue for example if we had increased our fiscal 2012  returns reserves by 1 of nonconsignment sales to retailers for quickbooks turbotax and quicken our total net revenue for fiscal 2012  would have been approximately 3 million lower 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

we make ongoing assumptions relating to the collectibility of our accounts receivable the accounts receivable amounts presented on our balance sheets include reserves for accounts that might not be paid in determining the amount of these reserves we consider our historical level of credit losses we also make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations and we assess current economic trends that might impact the level of credit losses in the future our reserves have generally been adequate to cover our actual credit losses however since we cannot reliably predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers we cannot guarantee that our reserves will continue to be adequate if actual credit losses are significantly greater than the reserve we have established that would increase our general and administrative expenses and reduce our reported net income conversely if actual credit losses are significantly less than our reserve this would eventually decrease our general and administrative expenses and increase our reported net income we had a total of 229  million in gross accounts receivable and an allowance for doubtful accounts of 46  million on our balance sheet at july 31 2012  

fair value of investments and otherthantemporary impairments 

as described in note 2 to the financial statements in item 8 of this report we estimate the fair value of our availableforsale debt securities each quarter these investments consist of cash equivalents municipal bonds us treasury securities us agency securities corporate notes and municipal auction rate securities fair value is defined as the price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date when identical or similar assets are traded in active markets the level of judgment required to estimate their fair value is relatively low this is generally true for our cash equivalents which we consider to be level 1 assets and our municipal bonds us agency securities and corporate notes which we consider to be level 2 assets we measure the fair values of our level 2 investments with the help of a pricing service that either provides quoted market prices in active markets for identical or similar securities or uses observable inputs for their pricing without applying significant adjustments our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure that we record appropriate fair values for our level 2 investments these controls include comparison to pricing provided by a secondary pricing service or investment manager validation of pricing sources and models review of key model inputs analysis of periodoverperiod price fluctuations and independent recalculation of prices where appropriate 

tables of contents 

significant judgment is required to estimate the fair value of assets and liabilities when observable inputs are not available level 3 for example we use a discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of our municipal auction rate securities because we have determined that the market for those securities is inactive some of the key inputs to our discounted cash flow model are inherently uncertain the key inputs include projected future interest rates the likely timing of principal repayments the probability of full repayment publicly available pricing data for recently issued similar securities that are not subject to auctions and the impact of the reduced liquidity for auction rate securities at july 31 2012  we held a total of 41 million in municipal auction rate securities which was not significant compared with total availableforsale debt securities of 567 million  at that date 

we record unrealized gains and losses on our availableforsale securities net of income taxes in other comprehensive income in the equity section of our balance sheet until the security is sold or we determine that the decrease in fair value is otherthantemporary we consider a number of factors in determining whether to recognize an impairment charge including the reason for the decrease in fair value the severity of the decrease in fair value the length of time that the fair value has been less than the cost basis of the security the financial condition and nearterm prospects of the issuer and whether we intend to sell or may be required to sell the security before anticipated recovery of our cost basis changes in our estimates of the fair values of our availableforsale securities may result in material increases or decreases in our net income in the period in which the change occurs 

business combinations 

as described in “description of business and summary of significant accounting policies — business combinations”  in note 1 to the financial statements in item 8 of this report under the acquisition method of accounting we generally recognize the identifiable assets acquired the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interests in an acquiree at their fair values as of the date of acquisition we measure goodwill as the excess of consideration transferred which we also measure at fair value over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed the acquisition method of accounting requires us to exercise judgment and make significant estimates and assumptions regarding the fair values of the elements of a business combination as of the date of acquisition including the fair values of identifiable intangible assets deferred tax asset valuation allowances liabilities related to uncertain tax positions and contingencies this method also requires us to refine these estimates over a oneyear measurement period to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that if known would have affected the measurement of the amounts recognized as of that date if we are required to retroactively adjust provisional amounts that we have recorded for the fair values of assets and liabilities in connection with acquisitions these adjustments could materially decrease our operating income and net income and result in lower asset values on our balance sheet 

significant estimates and assumptions that we must make in estimating the fair value of acquired technology customer lists and other identifiable intangible assets include future cash flows that we expect to generate from the acquired assets if the subsequent actual results and updated projections of the underlying business activity change compared with the assumptions and projections used to develop these values we could record impairment charges in addition we have estimated the economic lives of certain acquired assets and these lives are used to calculate depreciation and amortization expense if our estimates of the economic lives change depreciation or amortization expenses could be accelerated or slowed 

goodwill acquired intangible assets and other longlived assets — impairment assessments 

we estimate the fair value of acquired intangible assets and other longlived assets that have finite useful lives whenever an event or change in circumstances indicates that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable we test for potential impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives annually in our fourth fiscal quarter or whenever indicators of impairment arise the timing of the annual test may result in charges to our statement of operations in our fourth fiscal quarter that could not have been reasonably foreseen in prior periods 

as described in “description of business and summary of significant accounting policies – goodwill acquired intangible assets and other longlived assets”  in note 1 to the financial statements in item 8 of this report in order to estimate the fair value of goodwill we use a weighted combination of a discounted cash flow model known as the income approach and comparisons to publicly traded companies engaged in similar businesses known as the market approach the income approach requires us to use a number of assumptions including market factors specific to the business the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows to be generated by the business over an extended period of time longterm growth rates for the business and a rate of return that considers the relative risk of achieving the cash flows and the time value of money we evaluate cash flows at the reporting unit level and the number of reporting units that we have identified may make impairment more probable than it would be at a company with fewer reporting units and more integrated operations following acquisitions although the assumptions we use in our discounted cash flow model are consistent with the assumptions we use to generate our 

tables of contents 

internal strategic plans and forecasts significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of future cash flows from each reporting unit and the relative risk of achieving those cash flows when using the market approach we make judgments about the comparability of publicly traded companies engaged in similar businesses we base our judgments on factors such as size growth rates profitability risk and return on investment we also make judgments when adjusting market multiples of revenue operating income and earnings for these companies to reflect their relative similarity to our own businesses we had a total of 22 billion  in goodwill on our balance sheet at july 31 2012  see note 5 to the financial statements in item 8 of this report for a summary of goodwill by reportable segment 

we estimate the recoverability of acquired intangible assets and other longlived assets that have finite useful lives by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows that we expect the asset to generate in order to estimate the fair value of those assets we estimate the present value of future cash flows from those assets the key assumptions that we use in our discounted cash flow model are the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows to be generated by the asset over an extended period of time and a rate of return that considers the relative risk of achieving the cash flows and the time value of money significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of future cash flows and the relative risk of achieving those cash flows we also make judgments about the remaining useful lives of acquired intangible assets and other longlived assets that have finite lives we had a total of  213 million  in net acquired intangible assets on our balance sheet at july 31 2012  

assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives are complex and often subjective they can be affected by a variety of factors including external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts for example if our future operating results do not meet current forecasts or if we experience a sustained decline in our market capitalization that is determined to be indicative of a reduction in fair value of one or more of our reporting units we may be required to record future impairment charges for goodwill and acquired intangible assets impairment charges could materially decrease our future net income and result in lower asset values on our balance sheet 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 we performed our annual goodwill impairment test using the methodology described in “description of business and summary of significant accounting policies – goodwill acquired intangible assets and other longlived assets”  in note 1 to the financial statements in part 8 of this report we determined that the estimated fair values of all of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values and that they were not impaired in addition during this analysis we concluded that the estimated fair values of all of our reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying values 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 we performed our annual goodwill impairment test as described in note 1 in step one of that test we compared the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value the estimated fair values of all of our reporting units except intuit health exceeded their carrying values and we concluded that they were not impaired during this analysis we also concluded that the estimated fair values of all of our reporting units except intuit health substantially exceeded their carrying values we completed step two of the test for our intuit health reporting unit and determined that the goodwill and acquired intangible assets associated with it were impaired consequently we recorded a goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge of approximately 30  million in fiscal 2011 see fair value measurements  assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis  in note 2 to the financial statements in item 8 of this report for more information 

as discussed above estimates of fair value for all of our reporting units can be affected by a variety of external and internal factors the market for online patienttoprovider communication solutions is dynamic and competition is intense circumstances that negatively affected our estimate of the fair value of our intuit health reporting unit included unforeseen delays in developing high quality timely offerings and marketing them effectively if we experience further delays the fair value of our intuit health reporting unit could decline further and we may be required to record additional goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges in the future 

accounting for sharebased compensation plans 

at july 31 2012  there was 347  million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested sharebased compensation arrangements granted under all equity compensation plans which we will amortize to expense in the future total unrecognized compensation cost will be adjusted for future changes in estimated forfeitures we expect to recognize that cost over a weighted average vesting period of 24  years 

we use a lattice binomial model and the assumptions described in note 12 to the financial statements in item 8 of this report to estimate the fair value of stock options granted we estimate the expected term of options granted based on implied exercise patterns using a binomial model we estimate the volatility of our common stock at the date of grant based on the implied 

tables of contents 

volatility of publicly traded oneyear and twoyear options on our common stock our decision to use implied volatility is based upon the availability of actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility we base the riskfree interest rate that we use in our option valuation model on the implied yield in effect at the time of option grant on constant maturity us treasury issues with equivalent remaining terms in fiscal 2012 we began paying quarterly cash dividends and as a result we began using an annualized expected dividend yield in our option valuation model we estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates we use historical data to estimate prevesting option forfeitures and record sharebased compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest we amortize the fair value of options on a straightline basis over the requisite service periods of the awards which are generally the vesting periods we may elect to use different assumptions under our option valuation model in the future which could materially affect our net income or loss and net income or loss per share 

restricted stock units rsus granted typically vest based on continued service we value these timebased rsus at the date of grant using the intrinsic value method adjusted for estimated forfeitures we amortize the fair value of timebased rsus on a straightline basis adjusted for estimated forfeitures over the service period certain rsus granted to senior management vest based on the achievement of preestablished performance or market goals we estimate the fair value of performancebased rsus at the date of grant using the intrinsic value method and the probability that the specified performance criteria will be met adjusted for estimated forfeitures each quarter we update our assessment of the probability that the specified performance criteria will be achieved and adjust our estimate of the fair value of the performancebased rsus if necessary we amortize the fair values of performancebased rsus over the requisite service period adjusted for estimated forfeitures for each separately vesting tranche of the award we estimate the fair value of marketbased rsus at the date of grant using a monte carlo valuation methodology and amortize those fair values over the requisite service period adjusted for estimated forfeitures for each separately vesting tranche of the award the monte carlo methodology that we use to estimate the fair value of marketbased rsus at the date of grant incorporates into the valuation the possibility that the market condition may not be satisfied provided that the requisite service is rendered the total fair value of the marketbased rsus at the date of grant must be recognized as compensation expense even if the market condition is not achieved however the number of shares that ultimately vest can vary significantly with the performance of the specified market criteria beginning in july 2012 all of the rsus we grant have dividend rights that are subject to the same vesting requirements as the underlying equity awards so we do not adjust the intrinsic market value of our rsus for dividends see note 12 to the financial statements in item 8 of this report for more information 

legal contingencies 

we are subject to certain legal proceedings as well as demands claims and threatened litigation that arise in the normal course of our business we review the status of each significant matter quarterly and assess our potential financial exposure if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated we record a liability and an expense for the estimated loss if we determine that a loss is possible and the range of the loss can be reasonably determined then we disclose the range of the possible loss significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination of whether an exposure is reasonably estimable our accruals are based on the best information available at the time as additional information becomes available we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates potential legal liabilities and the revision of estimates of potential legal liabilities could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 

income taxes — estimates of deferred taxes valuation allowances and uncertain tax positions 

we estimate our income taxes based on the various jurisdictions where we conduct business significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax rules and the potential for future adjustment of our uncertain tax positions by the united states internal revenue service or other taxing jurisdictions we estimate our current tax liability and assess temporary differences that result from differing treatments of certain items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which we show on our balance sheet we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized to the extent we believe that realization is not likely we establish a valuation allowance when we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in an accounting period we record a corresponding tax expense in our statement of operations 

at july 31 2012  we had net deferred tax assets of 190  million which included a valuation allowance of 8  million for certain state net operating loss and state tax credit carryforwards we recorded the valuation allowance to reflect uncertainties about whether we will be able to utilize some of our deferred tax assets before they expire the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income for the jurisdictions in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be 

tables of contents 

realizable while we have considered future taxable income in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we could in the future be required to increase the valuation allowance to take into account additional deferred tax assets that we may be unable to realize an increase in the valuation allowance would have an adverse impact which could be material on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which we record the increase 

we recognize and measure benefits for uncertain tax positions using a twostep approach the first step is to evaluate the tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon audit including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes for tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely of being realized upon settlement significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions we evaluate our uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis our evaluations are based upon a number of factors including changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law correspondence with tax authorities during the course of audits and effective settlement of audit issues changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in material increases or decreases in our income tax expense in the period in which we make the change which could have a material impact on our effective tax rate and operating results

operating income from continuing operations increased 14  in fiscal 2012  compared with fiscal 2011  due to the increase in revenue described above partially offset by higher costs and operating expenses excluding the 30 million fiscal 2011 goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge total operating expenses were 159 million higher in the fiscal 2012  period including about 144 million for higher staffing expenses and about 16 million for higher sharebased compensation expenses see “cost of revenue”  and “operating expenses”  later in this item 7 for more information 

net income from continuing operations increased 18  in fiscal 2012  compared with fiscal 2011  due to the increase in operating income lower interest expense due to the repayment of debt during the year and a slightly lower effective tax rate diluted net income per share from continuing operations for fiscal 2012  increased 22  to 252  as a result of the increase in net income and the decline in weighted average diluted shares compared with fiscal 2011

liquidity and capital resource requirements 

our cash cash equivalents and investments totaled 744 million  at july 31 2012  of this amount less than 20 was held by our foreign subsidiaries and subject to repatriation tax considerations we intend to permanently reinvest a significant portion of our earnings from foreign operations and we currently do not anticipate that we will need funds generated from foreign operations to fund our domestic operations in the event that funds from foreign operations are needed to fund operations in the united states if us taxes have not been previously provided on the related earnings we would provide for and pay additional us taxes at the time we change our intention with regard to the reinvestment of those earnings 

we evaluate on an ongoing basis the merits of acquiring technology or businesses or establishing strategic relationships with and investing in other companies we may decide to use cash and cash equivalents investments and our revolving line of credit facility to fund such activities in the future

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

investment portfolio 

there has been significant deterioration and instability in the financial markets during the last four fiscal years this period of extraordinary disruption and readjustment in the financial markets exposes us to additional investment risk the value and liquidity of the securities in which we invest could deteriorate rapidly and the issuers of these securities could be subject to credit rating downgrades in light of the current market conditions and these additional risks we actively monitor market conditions and developments specific to the securities in which we invest we believe that we take a conservative approach to investing our funds in that we invest only in highlyrated securities and diversify our portfolio of investments while we believe we take prudent measures to mitigate investment related risks such risks cannot be fully eliminated because of market circumstances that are outside our control 

our investments consist of instruments that meet quality standards that are consistent with our investment policy this policy specifies that except for direct obligations of the united states government securities issued by agencies of the united states government and money market funds we diversify our investments by limiting our holdings with any individual issuer we do not hold derivative financial instruments in our portfolio of investments see note 3 to the financial statements in item 8 of this report for a summary of the amortized cost and fair value of our investments by type of issue 

the following table presents our portfolio of cash equivalents and availableforsale debt securities as of july 31 2012  by stated maturity the table is classified by the original maturity date listed on the security and includes cash equivalents which consist primarily of money market funds at july 31 2012  the weighted average tax adjusted interest rate earned on our money market accounts was 006  and the weighted average tax adjusted interest rate earned on our investments was 122  



interest rate risk 

our cash equivalents and investments are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates interest rate movements affect the interest income we earn on cash equivalents and investments and the value of those investments should the federal reserve target rate increase by 25 basis points from the level of july 31 2012  the value of our investments would decrease by approximately 1  million should the federal reserve target rate increase by 100 basis points from the level of july 31 2012  the value of our investments would decrease by approximately 6 million 

we are also exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates as they affect our 500 million revolving credit facility advances under the credit facility accrue interest at rates that are equal to at our election either jp morgans alternate base rate plus a margin that ranges from 00  to 05  or the london interbank offered rate libor plus a margin that ranges from 09  to 15  actual margins under either election will be based on our senior debt credit ratings consequently our interest expense would fluctuate with changes in the general level of these interest rates if we were to borrow any amounts under the credit facility at july 31 2012  no amounts were outstanding under the credit facility 

on march 12 2007 we issued 500 million of 575 senior unsecured notes due on march 15 2017 we carry these senior notes at face value less unamortized discount on our balance sheets since these senior notes bear interest at fixed rates we have no financial statement risk associated with changes in interest rates however the fair value of these notes fluctuates when interest rates change see note 2 and note 10 to the financial statements in item 8 of this report for more information 

tables of contents 

impact of foreign currency rate changes 

the functional currencies of our international operating subsidiaries are generally the local currencies we translate the assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries at the exchange rates in effect on the balance sheet date we translate their revenue costs and expenses at the average rates of exchange in effect during the period we include translation gains and losses in the stockholders’ equity section of our balance sheets we include net gains and losses resulting from foreign exchange transactions in interest and other income in our statements of operations 

since we translate foreign currencies primarily canadian dollars british pounds indian rupees and singapore dollars into us dollars for financial reporting purposes currency fluctuations can have an impact on our financial results the historical impact of currency fluctuations has generally been immaterial we believe that our exposure to currency exchange fluctuation risk is not significant primarily because our global subsidiaries invoice customers and satisfy their financial obligations almost exclusively in their local currencies although the impact of currency fluctuations on our financial results has generally been immaterial in the past and we believe that for the reasons cited above currency fluctuations will not be significant in the future there can be no guarantee that the impact of currency fluctuations will not be material in the future as of july 31 2012  we did not engage in foreign currency hedging activities

product development 

since the markets for software and related services are characterized by rapid technological change shifting customer needs and frequent new product introductions and enhancements a continuous high level of investment is required to innovate and quickly develop new products and services as well as enhance existing offerings our product development efforts are becoming more important than ever as we pursue our connected services strategy which reflects a world where people and businesses are increasingly connected by technology and expect access to services at any time in any place 

we develop many of our products and services internally we have a number of united states and foreign patents and pending applications that relate to various aspects of our products and technology we supplement our internal development efforts by acquiring or licensing products and technology from third parties and establishing other relationships that enable us to enhance or expand our offerings more rapidly we expect to expand our third party technology relationships as we continue to pursue our connected services strategy 

our traditional core desktop software products — quickbooks turbotax lacerte proseries and quicken — tend to have predictable annual development and product release cycles we also develop innovative new offerings such as intuit gopayment for which development cycles can be more rapid developing consumer and professional tax software and services presents unique challenges because of the demanding development cycle required to accurately incorporate tax law and tax form changes within a rigid timetable the development timing for our payroll merchant services financial institutions and patienttoprovider communication offerings varies with business needs and regulatory requirements and the length of the development cycle depends on the scope and complexity of each project 

in our financial services business we have developed interfaces with the systems of many of the major providers of core processing software and services to financial institutions these system interfaces allow us to access a financial institution’s host system to provide end users access to their account data in addition to developing new interfaces we continue to enhance our many existing interfaces in order to deliver more robust connectivity and increase operating efficiencies 

we continue to make substantial investments in research and development and we expect to focus our future research and development efforts on enhancing existing products and services and on developing new products and services that will offer increased ease of use be customized for specific customer categories be webbased or mobile and feature improved integration with other intuit and third party products and services and with our internal information systems we also expect to continue to focus significant research and development efforts on ongoing projects to update the technology platforms for several of our offerings our research and development expenses were 634 million or 16 of total net revenue in fiscal 2011  573 million or 17 of total net revenue in fiscal 2010  and 556 million or 18 of total net revenue in fiscal 2009  

seasonality 

our quickbooks consumer tax and accounting professionals businesses are highly seasonal revenue from our quickbooks software products tends to be highest during our second and third fiscal quarters sales of income tax preparation products and services are heavily concentrated in the period from november through april in our consumer tax business a greater proportion of our revenue has been occurring later in this seasonal period due in part to the growth in sales of turbotax online for which revenue is recognized upon printing or electronic filing of a tax return the seasonality of our consumer tax and accounting professionals revenue is also affected by the timing of the availability of tax forms from taxing agencies and the ability of those agencies to receive electronic tax return submissions delays in the availability of tax forms or the ability of taxing agencies to receive submissions can cause revenue to shift from our second fiscal quarter to future fiscal quarters these seasonal patterns mean that our total net revenue is usually highest during our second quarter ending january 31 and third 

tables of contents 

quarter ending april 30 we typically report losses in our first quarter ending october 31 and fourth quarter ending july 31 when revenue from our tax businesses is minimal while operating expenses continue at relatively consistent levels we believe the seasonality of our revenue and profitability is likely to continue in the future 

marketing sales and distribution channels 

markets 

our primary target customers are small and mediumsized businesses consumers accounting professionals and mediumsized financial institutions the markets in which we compete have always been characterized by rapid technological change shifting customer needs and frequent new product introductions and enhancements by competitors over the past several years the widespread availability of the internet mobile devices and the explosion of social media have accelerated the pace of change and revolutionized the way that customers learn about evaluate and purchase products and services 

realtime personalized online and mobile shopping experiences are rapidly becoming the standard in addition many customers now begin shopping in one channel and ultimately purchase in another this creates a need for integrated multichannel shopandbuy experiences market and industry changes quickly make existing products and services obsolete our success depends on our ability to respond rapidly to these changes with new business models updated competitive strategies new or enhanced products and services alternative distribution methods and other changes in the way we do business 

our target customers for online banking services are mediumsized financial institutions seeking an outsourced solution that allows them to compete with the larger national banks in their market we also provide online financial management solutions to financial institution customers of core processors 

marketing programs 

to sell our products and services to small and mediumsized businesses consumers and accounting professionals we use a variety of traditional and innovative marketing programs to generate software orders stimulate demand and generally maintain and increase customer awareness of our product portfolio these programs include web marketing and targeted advertising such as search engine optimization and purchasing key words from major search engine companies placing and promoting our mobile applications in app stores directresponse mail and email campaigns telephone solicitations newspaper magazine billboard radio and television advertising social media campaigns and coordinated promotional offers with major retailers we also use workflowintegrated inproduct discovery in some of our software products to market other related products and services including thirdparty products and services in addition we create marketing campaigns that attract new users through free promotional offerings that are designed to ultimately convert them to paying customers 

our financial services business focuses its marketing efforts on identifying potential financial institution clients and marketing our online banking services to consumer end users in cooperation with our financial institution clients we also work with these financial institutions to provide their customers with other intuit products and services such as turbotax for online banking 

sales and distribution channels 

multichannel shopandbuy experiences our consumer and small and mediumsized business customers increasingly use the internet and mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets to research products and services some customers buy and use our products and services entirely online or through their mobile devices others purchase desktop products and services using the internet still others make their final decision at a retail location we coordinate our websites promotions and retail displays to support this integrated multichannel shopandbuy model 

direct sales channel  we sell many of our products and services for small and mediumsized businesses consumers and accounting professionals directly through our websites and call centers telesales continues to be an effective channel for serving customers that want live help to select the products and services that are right for their needs 

our financial services business sells its products and services to financial institutions using a direct sales model and to a lesser but increasing extent in cooperation with core processing partners our typical sales cycle is approximately nine to 18 months for new financial institutions and four to six months for addon sales to existing customers 

retail channel  we sell our quickbooks turbotax and quicken desktop software as well as our quickbooks payroll and intuit online payroll services and merchant credit card payment processing services at retail locations across the united states we sell these products and services directly and through distributors to office supply superstores warehouse clubs consumer electronics retailers general mass merchandisers online retailers and catalogs in canada and other international markets we 

tables of contents 

also rely on distributors and other third parties who sell products into the retail channel the retail channel provides broad customer reach through retailersponsored advertising and exposure to retail foot traffic this channel also gives us the opportunity to communicate our products services and messages through multiple touch points and allows us to serve our customers at relatively modest cost 

other channels we have strategies to address the alliance partner solution provider and personal computer hardware manufacturer channels revenue from these channels is currently less significant than revenue from our direct and retail channels but it is growing we sell our consumer and small business products and services through selected alliance partners primarily banks credit unions and securities and investment firms these alliance partners help us reach new customers at the point of transaction and drive growth and market share by extending our online reach solution providers combine our products and services with valueadded marketing sales and technical expertise to deliver a complete solution at the local level relationships with selected personal computer hardware manufacturers help us attract new customers for our core software offerings as we expand our mobile and global offerings we expect that strategic partnerships will become increasingly important to our business for example we are marketing and selling some of our offerings through mobile phone service and hardware providers 

our financial services business has joint marketing arrangements with several core processing vendors they include fiserv inc open solutions inc fidelity information services inc and computer services inc to deliver bill payment and bill presentment services to our financial institution customers we also maintain valueadded reseller relationships with major providers such as fidelity information services and fiserv 

competition 

overview 

we face intense competition in all of our businesses both domestically and internationally competitive interest and expertise in many of the markets we serve particularly small business consumer tax and online banking have grown markedly over the past few years and we expect this trend to continue some of our existing competitors have significantly greater financial technical and marketing resources than we do in addition the competitive landscape can shift rapidly as new companies enter markets in which we compete this is particularly true for online products and services where the barriers to entry are lower than they are for desktop software products and services to attract customers many online competitors are offering free or lowpriced entrylevel products which we must take into account in our pricing strategies 

our most obvious competition comes from other companies that offer technology solutions similar to ours however for many of our products and services other important competitive alternatives for customers are third party service providers such as professional accountants and seasonal assisted tax preparation businesses manual tools and processes or generalpurpose software are also important competitive alternatives many of our new customers previously used pencil and paper or software such as word processors and spreadsheets rather than competitors’ software and services to perform financial tasks we believe that there is a longterm trend away from manual methods and toward the use of desktop and online software as well as mobile devices to accomplish these tasks that will continue to provide growth opportunities 

competition specific to business segments 

small business group our quickbooks desktop product is the leading small business financial management software in the us retail channel our small business products and services face competitive challenges from companies such as the sage group plc which offers software and associated services that directly target small business customers increasingly our small business products and services also face competition from free or lowcost online accounting offerings as well as free online banking and bill payment services offered by financial institutions and others in our payroll business we compete directly with automatic data processing inc adp paychex and many other companies with payroll offerings including online payroll offerings in our merchant services business we compete directly with large financial institutions such as wells fargo jp morgan chase and bank of america and with many payment processors including first data corporation elavon global payments and fiscertegy 

consumer tax  in the private sector we face intense competition from hr block which provides assisted tax preparation services in its stores and a competing software offering called hr block at home and from several other tax preparation service providers and online offerings including 2nd story software’s taxact these competing offerings subject us to significant price pressure 

tables of contents 

we also face competitive challenges in our consumer tax business from publicly funded government entities that offer electronic tax preparation and filing services at no cost to individual taxpayers we are a member of the free file alliance a consortium of private sector companies that has entered into an agreement with the federal government under this agreement the member companies provide online federal tax preparation and filing services at no cost to eligible federal taxpayers and the federal government has agreed not to provide a competing service approximately 20 states have also adopted free file alliance publicprivate agreements while approximately 20 other states offer some form of direct government tax preparation and filing services free to qualified taxpayers we continue to actively work with others in the private and public sectors to advance the goals of the free file alliance policy initiative and to support successful publicprivate partnerships however future administrative regulatory or legislative activity in this area could harm our consumer tax business 

accounting professionals our lacerte professional tax offerings face competition from competitivelypriced tax and accounting solutions that include integration with nontax functionality these include cch’s prosystems fx office suite and thomson reuters’ cs professional suite and gosystems tax our proseries professional tax offerings face competition from cch’s atx and taxwise offerings we also face growing competition from online tax and accounting offerings which may be marketed more effectively or have lower pricing than our offerings for accounting professionals 

financial services the market for online banking services is highly competitive in the area of consumer online banking a number of companies offer outsourced online banking services to financial institutions including online resources s1 corporation and fundsxpress a subsidiary of first data corporation in addition several companies whose primary offerings are core processing or bill payment processing services also provide online banking services these companies include fiserv inc open solutions inc fidelity information services inc and jack henry in addition many of these firms offer our products through a referral or reseller arrangement with us we also compete for new customers with relatively recent entrants into the online financial management solutions market as we negotiate service contract renewals with current customers competitive pressures may require us to make concessions on pricing and other material terms to convince these customers to remain with us 

competitive factors 

we believe the most important competitive factors for our core offerings — quickbooks turbotax lacerte proseries and quicken — are ease of use product features size of the installed customer base brand name recognition value proposition cost reliability and product and support quality access to distribution channels is also important for our quickbooks turbotax and quicken software products in addition support from accounting professionals and the ability for customers to upgrade within product families as their businesses grow are significant competitive factors for our quickbooks products productivity is an important competitive factor for the fullservice accounting firms to which we market our lacerte software products we believe we compete effectively on these factors as our quickbooks turbotax and quicken products are the leading products in the us retail sales channel for their respective categories 

for our service offerings such as small business payroll merchant payment processing outsourced online banking and patienttoprovider communication solutions features and ease of use the integration of these products with related software brand name recognition effective distribution quality of support cost and scalability of operations are important competitive factors 

customer service and technical support 

we provide customer service and technical support by telephone email online chat text messaging online communities and our customer service and technical support websites we have fulltime and outsourced customer service and technical support staffs we supplement these staffs with seasonal employees and additional outsourcing during periods of peak call volumes such as during the tax return filing season or following a major product launch we outsource to several firms domestically and internationally most of our internationally outsourced consumer and small business customer service and technical support personnel are currently located in india and the philippines 

we offer free selfhelp information through our technical support websites for our quickbooks turbotax accounting professionals and quicken software products customers can use our websites to find answers to commonly asked questions and check on the status of orders under certain support plans customers can also use our websites to receive product updates electronically support alternatives and fees vary by product we also sponsor online user communities such as intuit community for small businesses and accounting professionals and turbotax live community where consumers can share knowledge and product advice with each other

manufacturing and distribution 

desktop software and supplies 

the key processes in manufacturing desktop software are manufacturing compact discs cds printing boxes and related materials and assembling and shipping the final products 

for retail manufacturing we have an agreement with arvato digital services inc adis a division of bertelsmann ag under which adis provides a majority of the manufacturing volume for our launches of quickbooks turbotax and quicken as well as for daytoday replenishment after product launches adis has operations in multiple locations that can provide redundancy if necessary we also have an agreement with jvc america inc under which jvc provides secondary outsourced manufacturing volume for these launches and for daytoday replenishment 

for retail distribution we have an agreement with adis under which adis handles all logistics services our retail product launches are operationally complex our model for product delivery for retail launches and replenishment is a hybrid of direct to store deliveries and shipments to central warehouse locations this allows improved inventory management by our retailers we also ship products for many of our smaller retail customers through distributors 

adis also provides most of the manufacturing volume and distribution services for our direct desktop software orders we have an exclusive agreement with harland clarke a division of mf worldwide corporation to fulfill orders for all of our printed checks and most other products for our financial supplies business 

we have multiple sources for all of our raw materials and availability has historically not been a significant problem for us 

prior to major product releases for our core desktop software products we tend to have significant levels of backlog but at other times backlog is minimal and we typically ship products within a few days of receiving an order because of this fluctuation in backlog we believe that backlog is not a reliable predictor of our future core desktop software sales 

online products and services 

intuit’s data centers house most of the systems networks and databases required to operate and deliver our online products and services these include quickbooks online online payroll services merchant payment processing services website hosting services for small businesses turbotax online proline tax online consumer and professional electronic tax filing services outsourced online banking services and mintcom through our data centers we connect customers to our products and services and store customer and business information as our businesses continue to move toward delivering more online products and services in conjunction with our connected services strategy our infrastructure will become even more critical in the future 

currently we have a number of data centers that are primarily located in the western united states we are executing on a multiyear plan to transition to fewer data centers in more geographically diverse locations our primary data center is located in washington state and over time we expect this data center to support the hosting and high availability requirements of many of our existing and future connected services offerings we have a primary backup facility at a colocated data center in nevada 

privacy and security of customer information and transactions 

we are subject to various federal state and international laws and regulations and to financial institution requirements relating to the privacy and security of customer and employee personal information we are also subject to laws and regulations that apply to the internet behavioral tracking telemarketing email activities data hosting and retention financial and health information and credit reporting additional laws in all of these areas are likely to be passed in the future which could result in significant limitations on or changes to the ways in which we can collect use host store or transmit the personal information and data of our customers or employees communicate with our customers and deliver products and services or may significantly increase our compliance costs if our business expands to new industry segments and new uses of data that are regulated for privacy and security or to countries outside the united states that have strict data protections laws our compliance requirements and costs will increase 

through a master privacy policy framework designed to be consistent with globally recognized privacy principles we comply with united states federal and other country guidelines and practices to help ensure that customers and employees are aware of and can control how we use information about them our primary websites such as quickbookscom and turbotaxcom have 

tables of contents 

been certified by truste an independent organization that operates a website privacy certification program representing industry standard practices to address users’ and regulators’ concerns about online privacy we also use privacy statements to provide notice to customers of our privacy practices as well as provide them the opportunity to furnish instructions with respect to use of their personal information we participate in industry groups whose purpose is to develop or influence industry best practices and to influence public policy for privacy and security 

to address security concerns we use security safeguards to help protect the systems and the information customers give to us from loss misuse and unauthorized alteration whenever customers transmit sensitive information such as a credit card number or tax return data to us through one of our websites we use industry standards to encrypt the data as it is transmitted to us we work to protect our systems from unauthorized internal or external access using numerous commercially available computer security products as well as internally developed security procedures and practices 

government regulation 

the financial services industry is subject to extensive and complex federal and state regulation our financial institution customers which include commercial banks and credit unions operate in markets that are subject to rigorous regulatory oversight and supervision the compliance of our products and services with these requirements depends on a variety of factors including the particular functionality the interactive design and the charter or license of the financial institution our financial services customers must independently assess and determine what is required of them under these regulations and are responsible for ensuring that our systems and the design of their websites conform to their regulatory obligations 

our intuit financial services business is not directly subject to federal or state regulations specifically applicable to financial institutions such as banks and credit unions however as a provider of services to financial institutions this business is examined by the federal financial institution examination council under the information technology examination guidelines although we believe we are not subject to direct supervision by federal and state banking agencies with regard to other regulations we have from time to time agreed to examinations of our business and operations by these agencies 

our consumer tax and accounting professionals businesses are also subject to federal and state government requirements including regulations related to the electronic filing of tax returns the provision of tax preparer assistance and the use and disclosure of customer information in addition we offer certain other products and services such as small business payroll merchant payment processing services prepaid debit cards and patienttoprovider communication solutions which are subject to special regulatory requirements as we expand our products and services we may become subject to additional government regulation new laws or regulations may be adopted that could impose significant limitations on our business and increase our cost of compliance we continually analyze new business opportunities both domestically and internationally and new businesses and business models that we pursue may require additional costs for regulatory compliance 

we are subject to federal and state laws and government regulations concerning employee safety and health and environmental matters the occupational safety and health administration the environmental protection agency and other federal and state agencies have the authority to put regulations in place that may have an impact on our operations 

intellectual property 

our success depends on the proprietary technology embodied in our offerings we protect this proprietary technology by relying on a variety of intellectual property mechanisms including copyright patent trade secret and trademark laws restrictions on disclosure and other methods for example we regularly file applications for patents copyrights and trademarks and service marks in order to protect intellectual property that we believe is important to our business we hold a small but growing patent portfolio that we believe is important to intuits overall competitive advantage although we are not materially dependent on any one patent or particular group of patents in our portfolio at this time w e also have a number of registered trademarks that include intuit quickbooks turbotax lacerte proseries quicken and mint we have registered these and other trademarks and service marks in the united states and depending on the relevance of each brand to other markets in many foreign countries most registrations can be renewed perpetually at 10year intervals we also license intellectual property from third parties for use in our products 

although our portfolio of patents is growing the patents that have been issued to us could be determined to be invalid and may not be enforceable against competitive products in every jurisdiction in addition third parties have asserted and may in the future assert infringement claims against us and our customers these claims and any litigation may result in invalidation of our proprietary rights or a finding of infringement along with an assessment of damages litigation even if without merit 

tables of contents 

could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention in addition third party licenses may not continue to be available to us on commercially acceptable terms or at all 

employees 

as of july 31 2011  we had approximately 8000 employees in major offices in the united states canada india the united kingdom and other locations we believe our future success and growth will depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees in all areas of our business we do not currently have any collective bargaining agreements with our employees and we believe employee relations are generally good although we have employmentrelated agreements with a number of key employees these agreements do not guarantee continued service we believe we offer competitive compensation and a good working environment we were named one of fortune magazine’s “100 best companies to work for” in each of the last ten years however we face intense competition for qualified employees and we expect to face continuing challenges in recruiting and retention

risk factors 

forwardlooking statements and risk factors 

this annual report on form 10k contains forwardlooking statements all statements in this report other than statements that are purely historical are forwardlooking statements words such as “expect” “anticipate” “intend” “plan” “believe” “forecast” “estimate” “seek” and similar expressions also identify forwardlooking statements in this report forwardlooking statements include without limitation the following 

 

we caution investors that forwardlooking statements are only predictions based on our current expectations about future events and are not guarantees of future performance we encourage you to read carefully all information provided in this report and in our other filings with the sec before deciding to invest in our stock or to maintain or change your investment these forwardlooking statements are based on information as of the filing date of this annual report and we undertake no obligation to revise or update any forwardlooking statement for any reason 

because forwardlooking statements involve risks and uncertainties there are important factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forwardlooking statements these factors include the following 

we face intense competitive pressures that may harm our operating results 

we face intense competition in all of our businesses and we expect competition to remain intense in the future our competitors and potential competitors range from large and established entities to emerging startups our competitors may introduce superior products and services reduce prices have greater technical marketing and other resources have greater name recognition have larger installed bases of customers have wellestablished relationships with our current and potential customers advertise aggressively or beat us to market with new products and services in addition we may face competition from existing companies with large established consumer userbases and broadbased platforms who may change or expand the focus of their business strategies and target our customers such as small businesses and financial institutions we also face intensified competition from providers of free accounting tax payments banking and other financial services in order to 

tables of contents 

compete we have also introduced free offerings in several categories but we may not be able to attract customers or effectively monetize all of these offerings and customers who have formerly paid for intuit’s products and services may elect to use free offerings instead these competitive factors may diminish our revenue and profitability and harm our ability to acquire and retain customers 

our consumer tax business also faces significant competition from the public sector where we face the risk of federal and state taxing authorities developing software or other systems to facilitate tax return preparation and electronic filing at no charge to taxpayers these or similar programs may be introduced or expanded in the future which may cause us to lose customers and revenue for example during tax season 2010 the federal government introduced a prepaid debit card program to facilitate the refund process our consumer and professional tax businesses provide this service as well although the free file alliance has kept the federal government from being a direct competitor to intuit’s tax offerings it has fostered additional online competition and may cause us to lose significant revenue opportunities the current agreement with the free file alliance is scheduled to expire in october 2014 we anticipate that governmental encroachment at both the federal and state levels may present a continued competitive threat to our business for the foreseeable future 

future revenue growth depends upon our ability to adapt to technological change and successfully introduce new and enhanced products services and business models 

the software as a service saas desktop software and mobile technology industries are characterized by rapidly changing technology evolving industry standards and frequent new product introductions as we continue to grow our saas mobile and other offerings we must continue to innovate and develop new products and features to meet changing customer needs and attract and retain talented software developers we need to continue to develop our skills tools and capabilities to capitalize on existing and emerging technologies which require us to devote significant resources 

a number of our businesses also derive a significant amount of their revenue from onetime upfront license fees and rely on customer upgrades and service offerings to generate a significant portion of their revenues in addition our consumer and professional tax businesses depend significantly on revenue from customers who return each year to use our updated tax preparation and filing software and services as our existing products mature encouraging customers to purchase product upgrades becomes more challenging unless new product releases provide features and functionality that have meaningful incremental value if we are not able to develop and clearly demonstrate the value of new or upgraded products or services to our customers our revenues may be harmed in addition as we continue to introduce and expand our new business models including offerings that are subscriptionbased or that are free to end users we may be unsuccessful in monetizing or increasing customer adoption of these offerings 

the number of people who access products and services through devices other than personal computers including mobile phones smartphones and handheld computers such as tablets has increased dramatically in the past few years we have limited experience to date in developing products and services for users of these alternative devices and the versions of our products and services developed for these devices may not be compelling to users as new devices and new platforms are continually being released it is difficult to predict the problems we may encounter in developing versions of our products and services for use on these alternative devices and we may need to devote significant resources to the creation support and maintenance of such offerings if we are slow to develop products and technologies that are compatible with these alternative devices of if our competitors are able to achieve those results more quickly than us we will fail to capture a significant share of an increasingly important portion of the market for online services which could adversely affect our business 

in some cases we may expend a significant amount of resources and management attention on offerings that do not ultimately succeed in their markets we have encountered difficulty in launching new products and services in the past if we misjudge customer needs in the future our new products and services may not succeed and our revenues and earnings may be harmed we have also invested and in the future expect to invest in new business models geographies strategies and initiatives such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties including distraction of management from current operations expenses associated with the initiatives and inadequate return on investments because these new initiatives are inherently risky they may not be successful and may harm our financial condition and operating results 

business interruption or failure of our information technology and communication systems may impair the availability of our products and services which may damage our reputation and harm our future financial results 

as we continue to transition our business to more connected services we become more dependent on the continuing operation and availability of our information technology and communication systems and those of our external service providers we do not have redundancy for all of our systems many of our critical applications reside in only one of our data centers and our disaster recovery planning may not account for all eventualities in addition we are in the process of updating our customer 

tables of contents 

facing applications and the supporting information technology infrastructure to meet our customers’ expectations for continuous service availability any difficulties in upgrading these applications or infrastructure or failure of our systems or those of our service providers may result in interruptions in our service which may reduce our revenues and profits cause us to lose customers and damage our reputation any prolonged interruptions at any time may result in lost customers additional refunds of customer charges negative publicity and increased operating costs any of which may significantly harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are in the process of migrating our applications and infrastructure to new data centers if we do not execute the transition to the new data centers in an effective manner we may experience unplanned service disruptions or unforeseen increases in costs which may harm our operating results and our business we do not maintain realtime backup of all our data and in the event of significant system disruption we may experience loss of data or processing capabilities which may cause us to lose customers and may materially harm our reputation and our operating results 

our business operations data centers information technology and communications systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters human error malicious attacks fire power loss telecommunications failures computer viruses computer denial of service attacks terrorist attacks and other events beyond our control the majority of our research and development activities our corporate headquarters our principal information technology systems and other critical business operations are located near major seismic faults we do not carry earthquake insurance for direct quakerelated losses our future financial results may be materially harmed in the event of a major earthquake or other natural or manmade disaster 

we rely on internal systems and external systems maintained by manufacturers distributors and other service providers to take and fulfill customer orders handle customer service requests and host certain online activities any interruption or failure of our internal or external systems may prevent us or our service providers from accepting and fulfilling customer orders or cause company and customer data to be unintentionally disclosed our continuing efforts to upgrade and expand our network security and other information systems as well as our highavailability capabilities may be costly and problems with the design or implementation of system enhancements may harm our business and our results of operations 

our hosting collection use and retention of personal customer information and data create risk that may harm our business 

a number of our businesses collect use and retain large amounts of personal customer information and data including credit card numbers tax return information bank account numbers and passwords personal and business financial data social security numbers healthcare information and payroll information we may also develop new business models that use certain personal information or data derived from personal information in addition we collect and maintain personal information of our employees in the ordinary course of our business some of this personal customer and employee information is held and some transactions are executed by third parties in addition as many of our products and services are webbased the amount of data we store for our users on our servers including personal information has been increasing and will continue to increase as we further transition our businesses to connected services we and our vendors use commercially available security technologies to protect transactions and personal information we use security and business controls to limit access and use of personal information however individuals or third parties may be able to circumvent these security and business measures and errors in the storage use or transmission of personal information may result in a breach of customer or employee privacy or theft of assets which may require notification under applicable data privacy regulations we employ contractors temporary and seasonal employees who may have access to the personal information of customers and employees or who may execute transactions in the normal course of their duties while we conduct background checks of our employees and other individuals and limit access to systems and data it is possible that one or more of these individuals may circumvent these controls resulting in a security breach 

we are subject to laws rules and regulations relating to the collection use and security of user data new laws in this area have been passed by several jurisdictions and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions these new laws may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and our current data protection policies and practices may not be consistent with those interpretations and applications in addition the ability to execute transactions and the possession and use of personal information and data in conducting our business subjects us to legislative and regulatory burdens that may require notification to customers or employees of a security breach restrict our use of personal information and hinder our ability to acquire new customers or market to existing customers as our business continues to expand to new industry segments that may be more highly regulated for privacy and data security and to countries outside the united states that have more strict data protection laws our compliance requirements and costs may increase we have incurred — and may continue to incur — significant expenses to comply with mandatory privacy and security standards and protocols imposed by law regulation industry standards or contractual obligations

a major breach of our security measures or those of third parties that execute transactions or hold and manage personal information may have serious negative consequences for our businesses including possible fines penalties and damages reduced customer demand for our services harm to our reputation and brands further regulation and oversight by federal or state agencies and loss of our ability to provide financial transaction services or accept and process customer credit card orders or tax returns from time to time we detect or receive notices from customers or public or private agencies that they have detected vulnerabilities in our servers our software or thirdparty software components that are distributed with our products the existence of vulnerabilities even if they do not result in a security breach may harm customer confidence and require substantial resources to address and we may not be able to discover or remediate such security vulnerabilities before they are exploited in addition hackers develop and deploy viruses worms and other malicious software programs that may attack our offerings although this is an industrywide problem that affects software across platforms it is increasingly affecting our offerings because hackers tend to focus their efforts on the more popular programs and offerings and we expect them to continue to do so if hackers were able to circumvent our security measures or if we were unable to detect an intrusion into our systems and contain such intrusion in a reasonable amount of timewe may lose personal information although we have commercially available network and application security internal control measures and physical security procedures to safeguard our systems there can be no assurance that a security breach intrusion loss or theft of personal information will not occur which may harm our business customer reputation and future financial results and may require us to expend significant resources to address these problems including notification under data privacy regulations 

if we are unable to develop manage and maintain critical third party business relationships our business may be adversely affected 

our growth is dependent on the strength of our business relationships and our ability to continue to develop maintain and leverage new and existing relationships we rely on various third party partners including software and service providers suppliers vendors manufacturers distributors contractors financial institutions core processors licensing partners and development partners among others in many areas of our business in order to deliver our offerings and operate our business we also rely on third parties to support the operation of our business by maintaining our physical facilities equipment power systems and infrastructure in certain instances these third party relationships are sole source or limited source relationships and can be difficult to replace or substitute depending on the level of integration of the third party’s products or services into or with our offerings andor the general availability of such third party’s products and services in addition there may be few or no alternative third party providers or vendors in the market further there can be no assurance that we will be able to adequately retain third party contractors engaged to help us operate our business the failure of third parties to provide acceptable and high quality products services and technologies or to update their products services and technologies may result in a disruption to our business operations and our customers which may reduce our revenues and profits cause us to lose customers and damage our reputation alternative arrangements and services may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or we may experience business interruptions upon a transition to an alternative partner 

in particular we have relationships with banks credit unions or other financial institutions both as customers and as suppliers of certain critical services we offer to our other customers if macroeconomic conditions or other factors cause any of these institutions to fail consolidate stop providing certain services or institute costcutting efforts our business and financial results may suffer and we may be unable to offer those services to our customers 

increased government regulation of our businesses may harm our operating results 

many of our businesses are in highly regulated areas including our tax payroll payments financial services prepaid debit card and healthcare businesses there have been significant new regulations and heightened focus by the government on many of these areas in addition as we seek to grow our business we may expand into more highlyregulated businesses or countries which may subject us to increased regulatory scrutiny the application of these laws and regulations to our businesses is often unclear and compliance with these regulations may involve significant costs or require changes to our business practices that result in reduced revenue in addition new regulations or changes in current regulations may affect our operating results any changes that we may incur as a result of any such regulations may not be sustained over time depending on a number of factors including market and industry reactions to such regulations 

in order to meet regulatory standards we may be required to increase investment in compliance and auditing functions or new technologies in addition government authorities may enact other laws rules or regulations that place new burdens or restrictions on our business or determine that our operations are directly subject to existing rules or regulations such as requirements related to data collection use transmission retentionprocessing and security which may make our business more costly less efficient or impossible to conduct and may require us to modify our current or future products or services which may harm our future financial results 

tables of contents 

the tax preparation industry continues to receive heightened attention from federal and state governments new legislation regulation public policy considerations litigation by the government or private entities or new interpretations of existing laws may result in greater oversight of the tax preparation industry restrict the types of products and services that we can offer or the prices we can charge or otherwise cause us to change the way we operate our tax businesses or offer our tax products and services this in turn may increase our cost of doing business and limit our revenue opportunities in addition if our practices are not consistent with new interpretations of existing laws we may become subject to lawsuits penalties and other liabilities that did not previously apply we are also required to comply with a variety of state revenue agency standards in order to successfully operate our tax preparation and electronic filing services changes in stateimposed requirements by one or more of the states including the required use of specific technologies or technology standards may significantly increase the costs of providing those services to our customers and may prevent us from delivering a quality product to our customers in a timely manner 

our financial services business provides services to banks credit unions and other financial institutions that are subject to extensive and complex federal and state regulation as a result our financial institution customers require that our products and services comply with the regulations applicable to these customers if we are unable to comply with these regulations we may incur significant costs and penalties face litigation or governmental proceedings and lose our ability to sell to these customers any of these adverse events may harm our future financial results and our reputation 

if we fail to process transactions effectively or fail to adequately protect against disputed or potential fraudulent activities our revenue and earnings may be harmed 

our operations process a significant volume and dollar value of transactions on a daily basis especially in our payroll and payments businesses due to the size and volume of transactions that we handle effective processing systems and controls are essential to ensure that transactions are handled appropriately despite our efforts it is possible that we may make errors or that funds may be misappropriated due to fraud in our payroll and payments businesses we have been experiencing an increasing amount of fraudulent activities not only by our customers but also targeted fraud by third parties aimed directly at our offerings in addition to any direct damages and fines that any such problems may create which may be substantial a loss of confidence in our controls may seriously harm our business and damage our brand the systems supporting our business are comprised of multiple technology platforms that are difficult to scale if we are unable to effectively manage our systems and processes we may be unable to process customer data in an accurate reliable and timely manner which may harm our business in our payments processing service business if merchants for whom we process payment transactions are unable to pay refunds due to their customers in connection with disputed or fraudulent merchant transactions we may be required to pay those amounts and our payments may exceed the amount of the customer reserves we have established to make such payments 

third parties claiming that we infringe their proprietary rights may cause us to incur significant legal expenses and prevent us from selling our products 

as the number of products in the software industry increases and the functionality of these products further overlap and as we acquire technology through acquisitions or licenses we may become increasingly subject to infringement claims including patent copyright and trademark infringement claims litigation may be necessary to determine the validity and scope of the patent rights of others we have received an increasing number of allegations of patent infringement claims in the past and expect to receive more claims in the future based on allegations that our offerings infringe upon patents held by third parties some of these claims are the subject of pending litigation against us and against some of our customers these claims may involve patent holding companies or other adverse patent owners who have no relevant product revenues of their own and against whom our own patents may provide little or no deterrence the ultimate outcome of any allegation is uncertain and regardless of outcome any such claim with or without merit may be time consuming to defend result in costly litigation divert management’s time and attention from our business require us to stop selling delay shipping or redesign our products or require us to pay monetary damages for royalty or licensing fees or to satisfy indemnification obligations that we have with some of our customers our failure to obtain necessary license or other rights or litigation arising out of intellectual property claims may harm our business 

we rely on third party intellectual property in our products and services 

many of our products and services include intellectual property of third parties which we license under agreements that must be renewed or renegotiated from time to time we may not be able to obtain licenses to these third party technologies or content on reasonable terms or at all if we are unable to obtain the rights necessary to use this intellectual property in our products and services we may not be able to sell the affected offerings and customers who are currently using the affected product may be disrupted which may in turn harm our future financial results damage our brand and result in customer loss also we and our customers have been and may continue to be subject to infringement claims as a result of the third party intellectual property incorporated in to our offerings although we try to mitigate this risk and we may not be ultimately liable for any potential 

tables of contents 

infringement pending claims require us to use significant resources require management attention and could result in loss of customers 

some of our offerings include thirdparty software that is licensed under socalled “open source” licenses some of which may include a requirement that under certain circumstances we make available or grant licenses to any modifications or derivative works we create based upon the open source software although we have established internal review and approval processes to mitigate these risks we may not be sure that all open source software is submitted for approval prior to use in our products many of the risks associated with usage of open source may not be eliminated and may if not properly addressed harm our business 

our intellectual property rights are valuable and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products services and brand 

our patents trademarks trade secrets copyrights and other intellectual property rights are important assets for us we aggressively protect our intellectual property rights by relying on federal state and common law rights in the us and internationally as well as a variety of administrative procedures we also rely on contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary rights in products and services the efforts that we take to protect our proprietary rights may not always be sufficient or effective protecting our intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming and may not be successful in every location any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business our brand and our ability to compete 

policing unauthorized use and copying of our products is difficult expensive and time consuming current us laws that prohibit copying give us only limited practical protection from software piracy and the laws of many other countries provide very little protection we frequently encounter unauthorized copies of our software being sold through online marketplaces although we continue to evaluate and put in place technology solutions to attempt to lessen the impact of piracy and engage in efforts to educate consumers and public policy leaders on these issues and cooperate with industry groups in their efforts to combat piracy we expect piracy to be a persistent problem that results in lost revenues and increased expenses 

because competition for our key employees is intense we may not be able to attract retain and develop the highly skilled employees we need to support our planned growth 

much of our future success depends on the continued service and availability of skilled personnel including members of our executive team and those in technical marketing and staff positions experienced personnel in the software mobile technologies data security and software as a service industries are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense especially in california and india where the majority of our employees are located also as we strive to continue to adapt to technological change and introduce new and enhanced products and business models we must be able to secure maintain and develop the right quality and quantity of engaged and committed talent although we strive to be an employer of choice we may not be able to continue to successfully attract retain and develop key personnel which may cause our business to suffer 

as our product and service offerings become more tightly integrated we may be required to recognize the related revenue over relatively longer periods of time 

our expanding range of products and services and the combinations in which we offer them generate different revenue streams than our traditional desktop software businesses and the accounting policies that apply to revenue from these offerings are complex for example as we offer more online services bundled with software products we may be required to defer a higher percentage of our software product revenue into future fiscal periods in addition as we offer more services on a subscription basis we recognize revenue from those services over the periods in which the services are provided this may result in significant shifts of revenue from quarter to quarter or from one fiscal year to the next 

the nature of our products and services necessitates timely product launches and if we experience significant product quality problems or delays it may harm our revenue earnings and reputation 

all of our tax products and many of our nontax products have rigid development timetables that increase the risk of errors in our products and the risk of launch delays our tax preparation software product development cycle is particularly challenging due to the need to incorporate unpredictable tax law and tax form changes each year and because our customers expect high levels of accuracy and a timely launch of these products to prepare and file their taxes by the tax filing deadline due to the complexity of our products and the condensed development cycles under which we operate our products sometimes contain “bugs” that may unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the software the complexity of our products may also make it difficult for us to consistently deliver offerings that contain the features functionality and level of accuracy that our customers expect when we encounter problems we may be required to modify our code distribute patches to customers who have 

tables of contents 

already purchased the product and recall or repackage existing product inventory in our distribution channels if we encounter development challenges or discover errors in our products late in our development cycle it may cause us to delay our product launch date any major defects or launch delays may lead to loss of customers and revenue negative publicity customer and employee dissatisfaction reduced retailer shelf space and promotions and increased operating expenses such as inventory replacement costs legal fees or payments resulting from our commitment to reimburse penalties and interest paid by customers due solely to calculation errors in our consumer tax preparation products 

our businesses are highly seasonal and our quarterly results could fluctuate significantly 

several of our businesses are highly seasonal which historically has caused significant quarterly fluctuations in our financial results revenue and operating results are usually strongest during the second and third fiscal quarters ending january 31 and april 30 due to our tax businesses contributing most of their revenue during those quarters and the timing of the release of our small business software products and upgrades we typically experience lower revenues and operating losses in the first and fourth quarters ending october 31 and july 31 our financial results may also fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year due to a variety of factors including changes in product sales mix that affect average selling prices product release dates the timing of delivery of federal and state tax forms any delay in our ability to successfully submit electronically filed tax returns with government agencies changes in consumer behavior the timing of our discontinuation of support for older product offerings changes to our bundling strategy such as the inclusion of upgrades with certain offerings changes to how we communicate the availability of new functionality in the future any of which may impact the pattern of revenue recognition and the timing of acquisitions divestitures and goodwill and acquired intangible asset impairment charges any fluctuations in our operating results may adversely affect our stock price 

we are frequently a party to litigation and regulatory inquiries which could result in an unfavorable outcome and have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operation and cash flows 

we are subject to various legal proceedings claims and regulatory inquiries that have arisen out of the ordinary conduct of our business and are not yet resolved and additional claims and inquiries may arise in the future the number and significance of these claims and inquiries have increased as our businesses have evolved any proceedings claims or inquiries initiated by or against us whether successful or not may be time consuming result in costly litigation damage awards consent decrees injunctive relief or increased costs of business require us to change our business practices or products require significant amounts of management time result in diversion of significant operations resources or otherwise harm of business and future financial results 

the continued global economic downturn may harm our business and financial condition 

the continued global economic downturn has caused disruptions and extreme volatility in global financial markets and increased rates of default and bankruptcy and has impacted consumer and small business spending these macroeconomic developments have affected and may continue to negatively affect our business and financial condition in particular because the majority of our revenue is derived from sales within the us economic conditions in the us have an even greater impact on us than companies with a more diverse international presence potential new customers may not purchase or delay purchase of our products and services and many of our existing customers may discontinue purchasing or delay upgrades of our existing products and services thereby negatively impacting our revenues and future financial results decreased consumer spending levels may also reduce credit and debit card transaction processing volumes causing reductions in our payments revenue poor economic conditions and high unemployment has caused and may continue to cause a significant decrease in the number of tax returns filed which may have a significant effect on the number of tax returns we prepare and file in addition weakness in the enduser consumer and small business markets may negatively affect the cash flow of our distributors and resellers who may in turn delay paying their obligations to us which may increase our credit risk exposure and cause delays in our recognition of revenue or future sales to these customers additionally if macroeconomic or other factors continue to cause banks credit unions mortgage lenders and other financial institutions to fail or result in further costcutting efforts or consolidation of these entities we may lose current or potential customers achieve less revenue per customer andor lose valuable relationships with such of these entities that provide critical services to our customers any of these events may harm our business and our future financial results 

we regularly invest resources to update and improve our internal information technology systems and software platforms should our investments not succeed or if delays or other issues with new or existing internal technology systems and software platforms disrupt our operations our business could be harmed 

we rely on our network and data center infrastructure and internal technology systems for many of our development marketing operational support sales accounting and financial reporting activities we are continually investing resources to update and improve these systems and environments in order to meet existing as well as the growing and changing 

tables of contents 

requirements of our business and customers if we experience prolonged delays or unforeseen difficulties in updating and upgrading our systems and architecture we may experience outages and may not be able to deliver certain offerings and develop new offerings and enhancements that we need to remain competitive such improvements and upgrades are often complex costly and time consuming in addition such improvements can be challenging to integrate with our existing technology systems or may uncover problems with our existing technology systems unsuccessful implementation of hardware or software updates and improvements could result in outages disruption in our business operations loss of revenue or damage to our reputation 

our international operations are subject to increased risks which may harm our business operating results and financial condition 

in addition to uncertainty about our ability to generate revenues from our foreign operations and expand into international markets there are risks inherent in doing business internationally including 

 

violations of the complex foreign and us laws and regulations that apply to our international operations may result in fines criminal actions or sanctions against us our officers or our employees prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with these laws there can be no assurance that our employees contractors or agents will not violate our policies these risks inherent in our international operations and expansion increase our costs of doing business internationally and may result in harm to our business operating results and financial condition 

if actual product returns exceed returns reserves our future financial results may be harmed 

we ship more desktop software products to our distributors and retailers than we expect them to sell in order to reduce the risk that distributors or retailers may run out of products this is particularly true for our consumer tax products which have a short selling season and for which returns occur primarily in our fiscal third and fourth quarters like many software companies that sell their products through distributors and retailers we have historically accepted significant product returns we establish reserves against revenue for product returns in our financial statements based on estimated returns and we closely monitor product sales and inventory in the retail channel in an effort to maintain adequate reserves in the past returns have not differed significantly from these reserves however if we experience actual returns that significantly exceed reserves it may result in lower net revenue 

unanticipated changes in our income tax rates may affect our future financial results 

our future effective income tax rates may be favorably or unfavorably affected by unanticipated changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or by changes in tax laws or their interpretation in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes these continuous examinations may result in unforeseen taxrelated liabilities which may harm our future financial results

amortization of acquired intangible assets and impairment charges may cause significant fluctuation in our net income 

our acquisitions have resulted in significant expenses including amortization and impairment of acquired technology and other acquired intangible assets and impairment of goodwill total costs and expenses in these categories were approximately 91 million in fiscal 2011  91 million in fiscal 2010  and 101 million in fiscal 2009  although under current accounting rules goodwill is not amortized we may incur impairment charges related to the goodwill already recorded and to goodwill arising out of future acquisitions we test the impairment of goodwill annually in our fourth fiscal quarter or more frequently if indicators of impairment arise the timing of the formal annual test may result in charges to our statement of operations in our fourth fiscal quarter that may not have been reasonably foreseen in prior periods the total costs and expenses for fiscal 2011 included a goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge of 30 million for our intuit health reporting unit we recorded the goodwill and intangible assets for that reporting unit on our balance sheet in may 2010 in connection with our acquisition of medfusion inc at july 31 2011  we had 19 billion in goodwill and 180 million in net acquired intangible assets on our balance sheet both of which may be subject to impairment charges in the future new acquisitions and any impairment of the value of acquired intangible assets may have a significant negative impact on our future financial results 

our acquisition and divestiture activities may disrupt our ongoing business may involve increased expenses and may present risks not contemplated at the time of the transactions 

we have acquired and may continue to acquire companies products and technologies that complement our strategic direction acquisitions involve significant risks and uncertainties including 

 

because acquisitions and divestitures are inherently risky our transactions may not be successful and may in some cases harm our operating results or financial condition if we use debt to fund acquisitions or for other purposes our interest expense and leverage may increase significantly if we issue equity securities as consideration in an acquisition current shareholders’ percentage ownership and earnings per share may be diluted 

we have issued 1 billion in a debt offering and may incur other debt in the future which may adversely affect our financial condition and future financial results 

in fiscal 2007 we issued 500 million in senior unsecured notes due in march 2012 and 500 million in senior unsecured notes due in march 2017 as this debt matures we will have to expend significant resources to either repay or refinance these notes if we decide to refinance the notes we may be required to do so on different or less favorable terms or we may be unable to refinance the notes at all both of which may adversely affect our financial condition 

we have also entered into a 500 million fiveyear revolving credit facility although we have no current plans to request any advances under this credit facility we may use the proceeds of any future borrowing for general corporate purposes or for future acquisitions or expansion of our business 

this debt may adversely affect our financial condition and future financial results by among other things 

 

tables of contents 

our current revolving credit facility imposes restrictions on us including restrictions on our ability to create liens on our assets and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur indebtedness and require us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios our ability to comply with these ratios may be affected by events beyond our control in addition our short and longterm debt includes covenants that may adversely affect our ability to incur certain liens or engage in certain types of sale and leaseback transactions if we breach any of the covenants under our short and longterm debt or our revolving credit facility and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders then subject to applicable cure periods any outstanding indebtedness may be declared immediately due and payable 

in addition changes by any rating agency to our credit rating may negatively impact the value and liquidity of both our debt and equity securities if our credit ratings are downgraded or other negative action is taken the interest rate payable by us under our revolving credit facility may increase in addition any downgrades in our credit ratings may affect our ability to obtain additional financing in the future and may affect the terms of any such financing 

we are subject to risks associated with information disseminated through our services 

the laws relating to the liability of online services companies for information such as online content disseminated through their services are subject to frequent challenges in spite of settled law in the us claims are made against online services companies by parties who disagree with the content where our online content is accessed on the internet outside of the us challenges may be brought under foreign laws which do not provide the same protections for online services companies as in the us these challenges in either us or foreign jurisdictions may rise to legal claims alleging defamation libel invasion of privacy negligence copyright or trademark infringement or other theories based on the nature and content of the materials disseminated through the services certain of our services include content generated by users of our online services although this content is not generated by us claims of defamation or other injury may be made against us for that content any costs incurred as a result of this potential liability may harm our business 

our stock price may be volatile and your investment could lose value 

our stock price is subject to changes in recommendations or earnings estimates by financial analysts changes in investors or analysts valuation measures for our stock our credit ratings and market trends unrelated to our performance furthermore speculation in the press or investment community about our strategic position financial condition results of operations business or security of our products can cause changes in our stock price these factors as well as general economic and political conditions and the timing of announcements in the public market regarding new products product enhancements or technological advances by our competitors or us and any announcements by us of acquisitions major transactions or management changes may adversely affect our stock price further any changes in the amounts or frequency of share repurchases or dividends may also adversely affect our stock price a significant drop in our stock price could expose us to the risk of securities class actions lawsuits which may result in substantial costs and divert managements attention and resources which may adversely affect our business 

our business depends on our strong reputation and the value of our brands 

developing and maintaining awareness of our brands is critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our existing and future products and services and is an important element in attracting new customers adverse publicity whether or not justified relating to events or activities attributed to us our employees or agents may tarnish our reputation and reduce the value of our brands damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity may reduce demand for our products and services and thus have an adverse effect on our future financial results as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of the brands

our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda includes the following sections 

 

you should note that this mda discussion contains forwardlooking statements that involve risks and uncertainties please see the section entitled “forwardlooking statements and risk factors” at the beginning of item 1a for important information to consider when evaluating such statements 

you should read this mda in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes in item 8 of this report in fiscal 2009 we acquired paycycle inc and in fiscal 2010 we acquired mint software inc and medfusion inc we have included the results of operations for each of them in our consolidated results of operations from their respective dates of acquisition 

we have reclassified our financial statements for all periods presented to reflect our intuit real estate solutions business as discontinued operations see “results of operations — discontinued operations” later in this item 7 for more information unless otherwise noted the following discussion pertains only to our continuing operations 

executive overview 

this overview provides a high level discussion of our operating results and some of the trends that affect our business we believe that an understanding of these trends is important in order to understand our financial results for fiscal 2011 as well as our future prospects this summary is not intended to be exhaustive nor is it intended to be a substitute for the detailed discussion and analysis provided elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

overview of financial results 

total net revenue for fiscal 2011 was 39 billion  an increase of 11 compared with fiscal 2010  our small business group and our consumer tax segment were the key drivers of revenue growth revenue from our small business group increased 12 compared with fiscal 2010 due to growth in connected services offerings and improved offering mix revenue from our consumer tax segment increased 13 compared with fiscal 2010 due to growth in turbotax online federal units operating income from continuing operations increased 17 in fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 due to higher revenue partially offset by higher costs and expenses cost of revenue as a percentage of total revenue was slightly lower in fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 due to growth in turbotax online units and lower amortization expense operating expenses were 

tables of contents 

higher due to increases in spending for staffing expenses and marketing programs the addition of operating expenses for acquired businesses higher sharebased compensation expenses and a goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge net income from continuing operations increased 18 in fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010  in line with the increase in operating income diluted net income per share from continuing operations for fiscal 2011 increased 20 to 200 as a result of the increase in net income and the decline in weighted average diluted shares compared with fiscal 2010  

we ended fiscal 2011 with cash cash equivalents and investments totaling 14 billion  in fiscal 2011 we generated cash from operations from net sales of investments and from the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans during the same period we used cash for the repurchase of shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs and for capital expenditures at july 31 2011  authorization from our board of directors to expend up to 640 million remained available under the existing program for stock repurchases through august 16 2013 on august 18 2011 we announced a new stock repurchase program under which we are authorized to repurchase up to an additional 2 billion of our common stock from time to time over a threeyear period ending on august 15 2014 in august 2011 our board of directors declared the first cash dividend in our history of 015 per share of outstanding common stock payable on october 18 2011 to stockholders of record at the close of business on october 10 2011

our quickbooks consumer tax and accounting professionals offerings are highly seasonal revenue from our quickbooks software products tends to be highest during our second and third fiscal quarters sales of income tax preparation products and services are heavily concentrated in the period from november through april in our consumer tax business a greater proportion of our revenue has been occurring later in this seasonal period due in part to the growth in sales of turbotax online for which revenue is recognized upon printing or electronic filing of a tax return the seasonality of our consumer tax and accounting professionals revenue is also affected by the timing of the availability of tax forms from taxing agencies and the ability of those agencies to receive electronic tax return submissions delays in the availability of tax forms or the ability of taxing agencies to receive submissions can cause revenue to shift from our second fiscal quarter to future fiscal quarters 

these seasonal patterns mean that our total net revenue is usually highest during our second quarter ending january 31 and third quarter ending april 30 we typically report losses in our first quarter ending october 31 and fourth quarter ending july 31 when revenue from our tax businesses is minimal while operating expenses continue at relatively consistent levels we believe the seasonality of our revenue and profitability is likely to continue in the future 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

in preparing our financial statements we make estimates assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on our net revenue operating income or loss and net income or loss as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our balance sheet we believe that the estimates assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies senior management has reviewed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and their disclosure in this annual report on form 10k with the audit and risk committee of our board of directors 

revenue recognition 

we derive revenue from the sale of packaged software products software subscriptions hosted services technical support plans financial supplies implementation services transaction fees merchant services hardware and multiple element arrangements that may include a combination of these items we follow the appropriate revenue recognition rules for each type of revenue for additional information see “revenue recognition” in note 1 to the financial statements in item 8 of this report we generally recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists we have delivered the product or performed the service the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable however determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves exercising judgment and using estimates that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report for example for multiple element arrangements containing only software and softwarerelated elements we must exercise judgment and use estimates in order to 1 allocate the total price among the various elements we must deliver 2 determine whether undelivered services are essential to the functionality of the delivered products and services 3 determine whether vendorspecific evidence of fair value exists for each undelivered element and 4 determine whether and when each element has been delivered for multiple element arrangements containing both software and nonsoftware elements we must exercise judgment and use estimates in order to 1 determine whether and when each element has been delivered 2 determine the fair value of each element using the selling price hierarchy of vendorspecific evidence of fair value vsoe of fair value if available thirdparty evidence tpe if vsoe is not available and estimated selling price esp if neither vsoe nor tpe is available and 3 allocate the total price among the various elements based on the relative selling price method if we were to change any of these judgments or estimates it could cause a material 

tables of contents 

increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period amounts for fees collected or invoiced and due relating to arrangements where revenue cannot be recognized are reflected on our balance sheet as deferred revenue and recognized when the applicable revenue recognition criteria are satisfied 

in connection with the sale of certain products we provide a limited amount of free technical support assistance to customers we do not defer the recognition of any revenue associated with sales of these products since the cost of providing this free technical support is insignificant the technical support is generally provided within one year after the associated revenue is recognized and free product enhancements are minimal and infrequent we accrue the estimated cost of providing this free support upon product shipment 

return and rebate reserves 

as part of our revenue recognition policy we estimate future product returns and rebate payments and establish reserves against revenue at the time of sale based on these estimates our return policy allows distributors and retailers subject to contractual limitations to return purchased products product returns by distributors and retailers relate primarily to the return of excess and obsolete products in determining our product returns reserves we consider the volume and price mix of products in the retail channel historical return rates for prior releases of the product trends in retailer inventory and economic trends that might impact customer demand for our products including the competitive environment and the timing of new releases of our products we fully reserve for excess and obsolete products in the distribution channels 

our rebate reserves include distributor and retailer sales incentive rebates and enduser rebates our estimated reserves for distributor and retailer incentive rebates are based on distributors’ and retailers’ actual performance against the terms and conditions of rebate programs which we typically establish annually our reserves for enduser rebates are estimated based on the terms and conditions of the specific promotional rebate program actual sales during the promotion and historical redemption trends by product and by type of promotional program 

in the past actual returns and rebates have not differed significantly from the reserves that we have established however actual returns and rebates in any future period are inherently uncertain if we were to change our assumptions and estimates our revenue reserves would change which would impact the net revenue we report if actual returns and rebates are significantly greater than the reserves we have established the actual results would decrease our future reported revenue conversely if actual returns and rebates are significantly less than our reserves this would increase our future reported revenue for example if we had increased our fiscal 2011 returns reserves by 1 of nonconsignment sales to retailers for quickbooks turbotax and quicken our total net revenue for fiscal 2011 would have been about 3 million lower 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

we make ongoing assumptions relating to the collectibility of our accounts receivable the accounts receivable amounts presented on our balance sheets include reserves for accounts that might not be paid in determining the amount of these reserves we consider our historical level of credit losses we also make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations and we assess current economic trends that might impact the level of credit losses in the future our reserves have generally been adequate to cover our actual credit losses however since we cannot reliably predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers we cannot guarantee that our reserves will continue to be adequate if actual credit losses are significantly greater than the reserve we have established that would increase our general and administrative expenses and reduce our reported net income conversely if actual credit losses are significantly less than our reserve this would eventually decrease our general and administrative expenses and increase our reported net income we had a total of 191 million in gross accounts receivable and an allowance for doubtful accounts of 20 million on our balance sheet at july 31 2011  

fair value of investments 

as described in note 2 to the financial statements in item 8 of this report we estimate the fair value of our availableforsale securities each quarter these investments consist of cash equivalents municipal bonds us treasury securities us agency securities corporate notes and municipal auction rate securities fair value is defined as the price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date when identical or similar assets are traded in active markets the level of judgment required to estimate their fair value is relatively low this is generally true for our cash equivalents which we consider to be level 1 assets and our municipal bonds us agency securities and corporate notes which we consider to be level 2 assets however significant judgment is required to estimate the fair value of assets and liabilities when observable inputs are not available level 3 for example we use a discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of our municipal auction rate securities because we have determined that the market for those securities is 

tables of contents 

inactive we based this determination on the fact that due to a decrease in liquidity in the global credit markets regularly scheduled auctions for the municipal auction rate securities we hold have generally failed since february 2008 some of the key inputs to our discounted cash flow model are inherently uncertain the key inputs include projected future interest rates the likely timing of principal repayments the probability of full repayment publicly available pricing data for recently issued similar securities that are not subject to auctions and the impact of the reduced liquidity for auction rate securities at july 31 2011  we held a total of 59 million in municipal auction rate securities 

we record unrealized gains and losses on our availableforsale securities in other comprehensive income in the equity section of our balance sheet until the security is sold or we determine that the decrease in fair value is otherthantemporary we consider a number of factors in determining whether to recognize an impairment charge including the reason for the decrease in fair value the severity of the decrease in fair value the length of time that the fair value has been less than the cost basis of the security the financial condition and nearterm prospects of the issuer and whether we intend to sell or may be required to sell the security before anticipated recovery of our cost basis changes in our estimates of the fair values of our availableforsale securities may result in material increases or decreases in our net income in the period in which the change occurs 

business combinations 

as described in note 1 “description of business and summary of significant accounting policies — business combinations” in item 8 of this report under the acquisition method of accounting we generally recognize the identifiable assets acquired the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interests in an acquiree at their fair values as of the date of acquisition we measure goodwill as the excess of consideration transferred which we also measure at fair value over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed the acquisition method of accounting requires us to exercise judgment and make significant estimates and assumptions regarding the fair values of the elements of a business combination as of the date of acquisition including the fair values of identifiable intangible assets deferred tax asset valuation allowances liabilities related to uncertain tax positions and contingencies this method also requires us to refine these estimates over a oneyear measurement period to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that if known would have affected the measurement of the amounts recognized as of that date if we are required to retroactively adjust provisional amounts that we have recorded for the fair values of assets and liabilities in connection with acquisitions these adjustments could materially decrease our operating income and net income and result in lower asset values on our balance sheet 

significant estimates and assumptions that we must make in estimating the fair value of acquired technology customer lists and other identifiable intangible assets include future cash flows that we expect to generate from the acquired assets if the subsequent actual results and updated projections of the underlying business activity change compared with the assumptions and projections used to develop these values we could record impairment charges in addition we have estimated the economic lives of certain acquired assets and these lives are used to calculate depreciation and amortization expense if our estimates of the economic lives change depreciation or amortization expenses could be accelerated or slowed 

goodwill acquired intangible assets and other longlived assets — impairment assessments 

we estimate the fair value of acquired intangible assets and other longlived assets that have finite useful lives whenever an event or change in circumstances indicates that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable we test for potential impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives annually in our fourth fiscal quarter or whenever indicators of impairment arise the timing of the annual test may result in charges to our statement of operations in our fourth fiscal quarter that could not have been reasonably foreseen in prior periods 

as described in note 1 to the financial statements in item 8 of this report in order to estimate the fair value of goodwill we use a weighted combination of a discounted cash flow model known as the income approach and comparisons to publicly traded companies engaged in similar businesses known as the market approach the income approach requires us to use a number of assumptions including market factors specific to the business the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows to be generated by the business over an extended period of time longterm growth rates for the business and a rate of return that considers the relative risk of achieving the cash flows and the time value of money we evaluate cash flows at the reporting unit level and the number of reporting units that we have identified may make impairment more probable than it would be at a company with fewer reporting units and more integrated operations following acquisitions although the assumptions we use in our discounted cash flow model are consistent with the assumptions we use to generate our internal strategic plans and forecasts significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of future cash flows from each reporting unit and the relative risk of achieving those cash flows when using the market approach we make judgments about the comparability of publicly traded companies engaged in similar businesses we base our judgments on factors such as size growth rates profitability risk and return on investment we also make judgments when adjusting market multiples of revenue operating

income and earnings for these companies to reflect their relative similarity to our own businesses we had a total of 19 billion in goodwill on our balance sheet at july 31 2011  see note 5 to the financial statements in item 8 of this report for a summary of goodwill by reportable segment 

we estimate the recoverability of acquired intangible assets and other longlived assets that have finite useful lives by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows that we expect the asset to generate in order to estimate the fair value of those assets we estimate the present value of future cash flows from those assets the key assumptions that we use in our discounted cash flow model are the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows to be generated by the asset over an extended period of time and a rate of return that considers the relative risk of achieving the cash flows and the time value of money significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of future cash flows and the relative risk of achieving those cash flows we also make judgments about the remaining useful lives of acquired intangible assets and other longlived assets that have finite lives we had a total of  180 million in net acquired intangible assets on our balance sheet at july 31 2011  

assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives are complex and often subjective they can be affected by a variety of factors including external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts for example if our future operating results do not meet current forecasts or if we experience a sustained decline in our market capitalization that is determined to be indicative of a reduction in fair value of one or more of our reporting units we may be required to record future impairment charges for goodwill and acquired intangible assets impairment charges could materially decrease our future net income and result in lower asset values on our balance sheet 

in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 we performed our annual goodwill impairment test as described in note 1 “description of business and summary of significant accounting policies – goodwill acquired intangible assets and other longlived assets” in step one of that test we compared the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value the estimated fair values of all of our reporting units except intuit health exceeded their carrying values and we concluded that they were not impaired during this analysis we also concluded that the estimated fair values of all of our reporting units except intuit health substantially exceeded their carrying values we completed step two of the test for our intuit health reporting unit and determined that the goodwill and acquired intangible assets associated with it were impaired consequently we recorded a goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge of approximately 30 million in fiscal 2011 see note 2 fair value measurements  assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis for more information 

as discussed above estimates of fair value for all of our reporting units can be affected by a variety of external and internal factors the market for online patienttoprovider communication solutions is dynamic and competition is intense circumstances that negatively affected our estimate of the fair value of our intuit health reporting unit included unforeseen delays in developing high quality timely offerings and marketing them effectively if we experience further delays the fair value of our intuit health reporting unit could decline further and we may be required to record additional goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges in the future 

accounting for sharebased compensation plans 

at july 31 2011  there was 307 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested sharebased compensation arrangements granted under all equity compensation plans which we will amortize to expense in the future total unrecognized compensation cost will be adjusted for future changes in estimated forfeitures we expect to recognize that cost over a weighted average vesting period of 24 years 

we use a lattice binomial model and the assumptions described in note 12 to the financial statements in item 8 of this report to estimate the fair value of stock options granted we estimate the expected term of options granted based on implied exercise patterns using a binomial model we estimate the volatility of our common stock at the date of grant based on the implied volatility of publicly traded oneyear and twoyear options on our common stock our decision to use implied volatility is based upon the availability of actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility we base the riskfree interest rate that we use in our option valuation model on the implied yield in effect at the time of option grant on constant maturity us treasury issues with equivalent remaining terms in the past we never paid any cash dividends on our common stock and we did not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future consequently we used an expected dividend yield of zero in our option valuation model in july 2011 we determined that it was probable that we would pay cash dividends in the future and as a result we began using an expected dividend yield in our option valuation model see dividends in item 5 of this report for more information we estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates we use historical data to estimate prevesting option forfeitures and record sharebased 

tables of contents 

compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest we amortize the fair value of options on a straightline basis over the requisite service periods of the awards which are generally the vesting periods we may elect to use different assumptions under our option valuation model in the future which could materially affect our net income or loss and net income or loss per share 

restricted stock units rsus granted typically vest based on continued service prior to july 2011 we valued these timebased rsus at the date of grant using the intrinsic value method adjusted for estimated forfeitures certain rsus granted to senior management vest based on the achievement of preestablished performance or market goals prior to july 2011 we estimated the fair value of performancebased rsus at the date of grant using the intrinsic value method and the probability that the specified performance criteria would be met adjusted for estimated forfeitures as discussed above in july 2011 we determined that it was probable that we would pay cash dividends in the future since rsu holders are not entitled to dividends starting in july 2011 we began reducing the market price of our stock on the date of grant which is used in the intrinsic value method by the present value of the dividends expected to be paid on the shares during the vesting period discounted at the appropriate riskfree interest rate we amortize the fair value of timebased rsus on a straightline basis adjusted for estimated forfeitures over the restriction period we amortize the fair values of performancebased rsus over the requisite service period adjusted for estimated forfeitures for each separately vesting tranche of the award we estimate the fair value of marketbased rsus at the date of grant using a monte carlo valuation methodology and amortize those fair values over the requisite service period adjusted for estimated forfeitures for each separately vesting tranche of the award 

legal contingencies 

we are subject to certain legal proceedings as well as demands claims and threatened litigation that arise in the normal course of our business we review the status of each significant matter quarterly and assess our potential financial exposure if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated we record a liability and an expense for the estimated loss significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination of whether an exposure is reasonably estimable our accruals are based on the best information available at the time as additional information becomes available we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates potential legal liabilities and the revision of estimates of potential legal liabilities could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 

income taxes — estimates of deferred taxes valuation allowances and uncertain tax positions 

we estimate our income taxes based on the various jurisdictions where we conduct business significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax rules and the potential for future adjustment of our uncertain tax positions by the united states internal revenue service or other taxing jurisdictions we estimate our current tax liability and assess temporary differences that result from differing treatments of certain items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which we show on our balance sheet we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized to the extent we believe that realization is not likely we establish a valuation allowance when we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in an accounting period we record a corresponding tax expense in our statement of operations 

at july 31 2011  we had net deferred tax assets of 149 million which included a valuation allowance of 8 million for certain state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards we recorded the valuation allowance to reflect uncertainties about whether we will be able to utilize some of our deferred tax assets before they expire the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income for the jurisdictions in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be realizable while we have considered future taxable income in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we could in the future be required to increase the valuation allowance to take into account additional deferred tax assets that we may be unable to realize an increase in the valuation allowance would have an adverse impact which could be material on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which we record the increase 

we recognize and measure benefits for uncertain tax positions using a twostep approach the first step is to evaluate the tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon audit including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes for tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely of being realized upon settlement significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions we evaluate our uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis our evaluations are based upon a number of factors including changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law correspondence with tax authorities during the course of audits and effective settlement of audit issues changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax

positions could result in material increases or decreases in our income tax expense in the period in which we make the change which could have a material impact on our effective tax rate and operating results

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

investment portfolio 

there has been significant deterioration and instability in the financial markets during the last three fiscal years this period of extraordinary disruption and readjustment in the financial markets exposes us to additional investment risk the value and liquidity of the securities in which we invest could deteriorate rapidly and the issuers of these securities could be subject to credit rating downgrades in light of the current market conditions and these additional risks we actively monitor market conditions and developments specific to the securities in which we invest we believe that we take a conservative approach to investing our funds in that we invest only in highlyrated securities and diversify our portfolio of investments while we believe we take prudent measures to mitigate investment related risks such risks cannot be fully eliminated because of market circumstances that are outside our control 

our investments consist of instruments that meet quality standards that are consistent with our investment policy this policy specifies that except for direct obligations of the united states government securities issued by agencies of the united states government and money market funds we diversify our investments by limiting our holdings with any individual issuer we do not hold derivative financial instruments in our portfolio of investments see note 2 to the financial statements in item 8 of this report for a summary of the cost and fair value of our investments by type of issue 

the following table presents our portfolio of cash equivalents and availableforsale debt securities as of july 31 2011 by stated maturity the table is classified by the original maturity date listed on the security and includes cash equivalents which consist primarily of money market funds at july 31 2011  the weighted average tax adjusted interest rate earned on our money 

tables of contents 

market accounts was 004 and the weighted average tax adjusted interest rate earned on our investments was 076  



interest rate risk 

our cash equivalents and investments are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates interest rate movements affect the interest income we earn on cash equivalents and investments and the value of those investments should the federal reserve target rate increase by 25 basis points from the level of july 31 2011  the value of our investments would decrease by approximately 2 million should the federal reserve target rate increase by 100 basis points from the level of july 31 2011  the value of our investments would decrease by approximately 10 million 

we are also exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates as they affect our 500 million revolving credit facility advances under the credit facility accrue interest at rates that are equal to citibank’s base rate or the london interbank offered rate libor plus a margin that ranges from 018 to 0575 based on our senior debt credit ratings consequently our interest expense would fluctuate with changes in the general level of these interest rates if we were to borrow any amounts under the credit facility at july 31 2011  no amounts were outstanding under the credit facility 

on march 12 2007 we issued 500 million of 540 senior unsecured notes due on march 15 2012 and 500 million of 575 senior unsecured notes due on march 15 2017 we carry these senior notes at face value less unamortized discount on our balance sheets since these senior notes bear interest at fixed rates we have no financial statement risk associated with changes in interest rates however the fair value of these notes fluctuates when interest rates change see note 2 and note 10 to the financial statements in item 8 of this report for more information 

impact of foreign currency rate changes 

the functional currencies of our international operating subsidiaries are generally the local currencies we translate the assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries at the exchange rates in effect on the balance sheet date we translate their revenue costs and expenses at the average rates of exchange in effect during the period we include translation gains and losses in the stockholders’ equity section of our balance sheets we include net gains and losses resulting from foreign exchange transactions in interest and other income in our statements of operations 

since we translate foreign currencies primarily canadian dollars british pounds indian rupees and singapore dollars into us dollars for financial reporting purposes currency fluctuations can have an impact on our financial results the historical impact of currency fluctuations has generally been immaterial we believe that our exposure to currency exchange fluctuation risk is not significant primarily because our global subsidiaries invoice customers and satisfy their financial obligations almost exclusively in their local currencies although the impact of currency fluctuations on our financial results has generally been immaterial in the past and we believe that for the reasons cited above currency fluctuations will not be significant in the future there can be no guarantee that the impact of currency fluctuations will not be material in the future as of july 31 2011 we did not engage in foreign currency hedging activities

product development 

since the markets for software and related services are characterized by rapid technological change shifting customer needs and frequent new product introductions and enhancements a continuous high level of investment is required to innovate and quickly develop new products and services as well as enhance existing offerings our product development efforts are becoming more important than ever as we pursue our connected services strategy which reflects a world where people and businesses are increasingly connected by technology and expect access to services at any time in any place 

we develop many of our products and services internally we have a number of united states and foreign patents and pending applications that relate to various aspects of our products and technology we supplement our internal development efforts by acquiring or licensing products and technology from third parties and establishing other relationships that enable us to enhance or expand our offerings more rapidly we expect to expand our third party technology relationships as we continue to pursue our connected services strategy 

our traditional core desktop software products — quickbooks turbotax lacerte proseries and quicken — tend to have predictable annual development and product release cycles we also develop innovative new offerings such as intuit gopayment for which development cycles can be more rapid developing consumer and professional tax software and services presents unique challenges because of the demanding development cycle required to accurately incorporate tax law and tax form changes within a rigid timetable the development timing for our payroll merchant services financial institutions and patienttoprovider communication offerings varies with 

business needs and regulatory requirements and the length of the development cycle depends on the scope and complexity of each particular project 

in our financial services business we have developed interfaces with the systems of many of the major providers of core processing software and services to financial institutions these system interfaces allow us to access a financial institution’s host system to provide end users access to their account data in addition to developing new interfaces we continue to enhance our many existing interfaces in order to deliver more robust connectivity and increase operating efficiencies 

we continue to make substantial investments in research and development and we expect to focus our future research and development efforts on enhancing existing products and services and on developing new products and services that will offer increased ease of use be customized for specific customer categories be webbased or mobile and feature improved integration with other intuit and third party products and services and with our internal information systems we also expect to continue to focus significant research and development efforts on ongoing projects to update the technology platforms for several of our offerings our research and development expenses were 573 million or 17 of total net revenue in fiscal 2010 556 million or 18 of total net revenue in fiscal 2009 and 593 million or 20 of total net revenue in fiscal 2008 

seasonality 

our quickbooks consumer tax and accounting professionals businesses are highly seasonal revenue from our quickbooks software products tends to be highest during our second and third fiscal quarters sales of income tax preparation products and services are heavily concentrated in the period from november through april in our consumer tax business a greater proportion of our revenue has been occurring later in this seasonal period due in part to the growth in sales of turbotax online for which revenue is recognized upon printing or electronic filing of a tax return the seasonality of our consumer tax and accounting professionals revenue is also affected by the timing of the availability of tax forms from taxing agencies and the ability of those agencies to receive electronic tax return submissions delays in the availability of tax forms or the ability of taxing agencies to receive submissions can cause revenue to shift from our second fiscal quarter to our third fiscal quarter these seasonal patterns mean that our total net revenue is usually highest during our second quarter ending january 31 and third quarter ending april 30 we typically report losses in our first quarter ending october 31 and fourth quarter ending july 31 when revenue from our tax businesses is minimal while operating expenses continue at relatively consistent levels we believe the seasonality of our revenue and profitability is likely to continue in the future 

marketing sales and distribution channels 

markets 

our primary target customers are small and mediumsized businesses consumers accounting professionals and mediumsized financial institutions the markets in which we compete have always been characterized by rapid technological change shifting customer needs and frequent new product introductions and enhancements by competitors over the past several years the widespread availability of the internet has accelerated the pace of change and revolutionized the way that customers learn about and purchase products and services realtime personalized online shopping experiences are rapidly becoming the standard in addition many customers now begin their shopping process in one channel and ultimately make their purchase in a different channel this drives the need to create integrated multichannel shop and buy experiences market and industry changes are quickly rendering existing products and services obsolete so our success depends on our ability to respond rapidly to these changes with new business models updated competitive strategies new or enhanced products and services alternative distribution methods and other changes in the way we do business 

our target customers for online banking services are mediumsized financial institutions seeking an outsourced solution that allows them to compete with the larger national banks in their market we also provide online financial management solutions to financial institution customers of core processors 

marketing programs 

to sell our products and services to small and mediumsized businesses consumers and accounting professionals we use a variety of marketing programs to generate software orders stimulate demand and generally maintain and increase customer awareness of our products and services these programs include web marketing and targeted advertising including purchasing key words from major search engine companies directresponse mail and email campaigns telephone solicitations newspaper magazine billboard radio and television advertising and promotional offers that we coordinate with major retailers we also use workflowintegrated inproduct discovery in some of our software products to market other related products and services including thirdparty products and services 

in our financial services business our marketing efforts are primarily focused on identifying potential financial institution clients and marketing our online banking services to consumer and business end users in cooperation with our financial institution clients we also work with these financial institutions to provide other intuit products and services such as turbotax for online banking to their end users 

sales and distribution channels 

multichannel shop and buy experiences our consumer and small and mediumsized business customers increasingly use the internet to research both online and desktop products and services some customers buy and use our products and services entirely online others purchase desktop products and services using the internet still others prefer to make their final decision at a retail location we coordinate our websites promotions and retail displays in support of this integrated multichannel shop and buy model 

direct sales channel  we sell many of our products and services for small and mediumsized businesses consumers and accounting professionals directly to our customers through our websites and call centers telesales continues to be an effective channel for serving customers that want live help selecting the products and services that are right for their needs 

in our financial services business we sell our products and services to financial institutions using a direct sales model and to a lesser but increasing extent in cooperation with core processing partners our typical sales cycle is approximately nine to eighteen months for new financial institutions and four to six months for addon sales to existing customers 

retail channel  we sell our quickbooks turbotax and quicken desktop software as well as our quickbooks payroll and intuit online payroll services and merchant credit card payment processing services at retail locations across the united states we sell these products and services directly and through distributors to office supply superstores warehouse clubs consumer electronics retailers general mass merchandisers online retailers and catalogers in canada and other international markets we also rely on distributors and other third parties who sell products into the retail channel the retail channel provides broad customer reach through retailersponsored advertising and exposure to retail foot traffic this channel also gives us the opportunity to communicate our product and service lineup and messages through multiple touch points and allows us to serve our customers at relatively modest cost 

other channels we have strategies to address the alliance partner solution provider and personal computer hardware manufacturer channels revenue from these channels is currently less significant than revenue from our direct and retail channels but it is growing we sell our consumer and small business products and services through selected alliance partners primarily banks credit unions and securities and investment firms these alliance partners help us reach new customers at the point of transaction and drive growth and market share by extending our online reach solution providers combine our products and services with valueadded marketing sales and technical expertise to deliver a complete solution at the local level relationships with selected personal computer hardware manufacturers help us attract new customers for our core software offerings as we expand our mobile and global offerings we expect that key strategic partnerships will become increasingly important to our business for example we plan to market and sell some of our offerings through mobile phone service and hardware providers 

in our financial services business we have joint marketing arrangements with several core processing vendors they include fiserv inc open solutions inc fidelity information services inc metavante corporation now 

part of fidelity information services and computer services inc to deliver bill payment and bill presentment services to our financial institution customers we also maintain valueadded reseller relationships with major providers such as metavante corporation and checkfree corporation part of fiserv 

competition 

overview 

we face intense competition in all of our businesses both domestically and internationally competitive interest and expertise in many of the markets we serve particularly small business consumer tax and online banking have grown markedly over the past few years and we expect this trend to continue some of our existing competitors have significantly greater financial technical and marketing resources than we do in addition the competitive landscape can shift rapidly as new companies enter markets in which we compete this is particularly true for online products and services where the barriers to entry are lower than they are for desktop software products and services to attract customers many online competitors are offering free or lowpriced entrylevel products which we must take into account in our pricing strategies 

our most obvious competition comes from other companies that offer technology solutions similar to ours however for many of our products and services other important competitive alternatives for customers are third party service providers such as professional accountants and seasonal assisted tax preparation businesses manual tools and processes or generalpurpose software are also important competitive alternatives many of our new customers previously used pencil and paper or software such as word processors and spreadsheets rather than competitors’ software and services to perform financial tasks we believe that there is a longterm trend away from manual methods and toward the use of both desktop and online software to accomplish these tasks that will continue to provide growth opportunities 

competition specific to business segments 

small business group our quickbooks desktop product is the leading small business financial management software in the us retail channel our small business products and services face competitive challenges from companies such as netsuite inc and the sage group plc which offer software and associated services that directly target small business customers increasingly our small business products and services also face competition from free or lowcost online accounting offerings as well as free online banking and bill payment services offered by financial institutions and others in our payroll business we compete directly with automatic data processing inc adp paychex and many other companies with payroll offerings including online payroll offerings in our merchant services business we also compete directly with large financial institutions such as wells fargo jp morgan chase and bank of america and with many payment processors including first data corporation elavon global payments and fiscertegy 

consumer tax  in the private sector we face intense competition from hr block which provides assisted tax preparation services in its stores and a competing software offering called hr block at home and from several other tax preparation service providers and online offerings including 2nd story software’s taxact these competing offerings subject us to significant price pressure 

we also face competitive challenges in our consumer tax business from publicly funded government entities that offer electronic tax preparation and filing services at no cost to individual taxpayers we are a member of the free file alliance a consortium of private sector companies that has entered into an agreement with the federal government under this agreement the member companies provide online federal tax preparation and filing services at no cost to eligible federal taxpayers and the federal government has agreed not to provide a competing service approximately 20 states have also adopted free file alliance publicprivate agreements while approximately 20 other states offer some form of direct government tax preparation and filing services free to qualified taxpayers we continue to actively work with others in the private and public sectors to advance the goals of the free file alliance policy initiative and to support successful publicprivate partnerships however future administrative regulatory or legislative activity in this area could harm our consumer tax business 

accounting professionals our lacerte professional tax offerings face competition from competitivelypriced tax and accounting solutions that include integration with nontax functionality these include cch’s prosystems fx 

office suite and thomson reuters’ cs professional suite and gosystems tax our proseries professional tax offerings face competition from cch’s atx and taxwise offerings we also face growing competition from online tax and accounting offerings which may be marketed more effectively or have lower pricing than our offerings for accounting professionals 

financial services the market for online banking services is highly competitive in the area of consumer online banking a number of companies offer outsourced online banking services to financial institutions including online resources s1 corporation and fundsxpress a subsidiary of first data corporation in addition several companies whose primary offerings are core processing or bill payment processing services also provide online banking services these companies include fiserv inc open solutions inc fidelity information services inc jack henry and metavante corporation now part of fidelity information services in addition many of these firms offer our products through a referral or reseller arrangement with us we also compete for new customers with relatively recent entrants into the online financial management solutions market as we negotiate service contract renewals with current customers competitive pressures may require us to make concessions on pricing and other material terms to convince these customers to remain with us 

competitive factors 

we believe the most important competitive factors for our core offerings — quickbooks turbotax lacerte proseries and quicken — are ease of use product features size of the installed customer base brand name recognition value proposition cost reliability and product and support quality access to distribution channels is also important for our quickbooks turbotax and quicken software products in addition support from accounting professionals and the ability for customers to upgrade within product families as their businesses grow are significant competitive factors for our quickbooks products productivity is an important competitive factor for the fullservice accounting firms to which we market our lacerte software products we believe we compete effectively on these factors as our quickbooks turbotax and quicken products are the leading products in the us retail sales channel for their respective categories 

for our service offerings such as small business payroll merchant payment processing outsourced online banking and patienttoprovider communication solutions features and ease of use the integration of these products with related software brand name recognition effective distribution quality of support cost and scalability of operations are important competitive factors 

customer service and technical support 

we provide customer service and technical support by telephone email online chat text messaging online communities and our customer service and technical support websites we have fulltime and outsourced customer service and technical support staffs we supplement these staffs with seasonal employees and additional outsourcing during periods of peak call volumes such as during the tax return filing season or following a major product launch we outsource to several firms domestically and internationally most of our internationally outsourced consumer and small business customer service and technical support personnel are currently located in india and the philippines 

we offer free selfhelp information through our technical support websites for our quickbooks turbotax accounting professionals and quicken software products customers can use our websites to find answers to commonly asked questions and check on the status of orders under certain support plans customers can also use our websites to receive product updates electronically support alternatives and fees vary by product we also sponsor online user communities such as intuit community for small businesses and accounting professionals and turbotax live community where consumers can share knowledge and product advice with each other 

manufacturing and distribution 

desktop software and supplies 

the key processes in manufacturing desktop software are manufacturing compact discs cds printing boxes and related materials and assembling and shipping the final products 

for retail manufacturing we have an agreement with arvato digital services inc adis a division of bertelsmann ag under which adis provides a majority of the manufacturing volume for our launches of quickbooks turbotax and quicken as well as for daytoday replenishment after product launches adis has operations in multiple locations that can provide redundancy if necessary we also have an agreement with jvc america inc under which jvc provides secondary outsourced manufacturing volume for these launches and for daytoday replenishment 

for retail distribution we have an agreement with adis under which adis handles all logistics services our retail product launches are operationally complex our model for product delivery for retail launches and replenishment is a hybrid of direct to store deliveries and shipments to central warehouse locations this allows improved inventory management by our retailers we also ship products for many of our smaller retail customers through distributors 

adis also provides most of the manufacturing volume and distribution services for our direct desktop software orders we have an exclusive agreement with harland clarke a division of mf worldwide corporation to fulfill orders for all of our printed checks and most other products for our financial supplies business 

we have multiple sources for all of our raw materials and availability has historically not been a significant problem for us 

prior to major product releases for our core desktop software products we tend to have significant levels of backlog but at other times backlog is minimal and we typically ship products within a few days of receiving an order because of this fluctuation in backlog we believe that backlog is not a reliable predictor of our future core desktop software sales 

online products and services 

intuit’s data centers house most of the systems networks and databases required to operate and deliver our online products and services these include quickbooks online online payroll services merchant payment processing services website hosting services for small businesses turbotax online consumer and professional electronic tax filing services outsourced online banking services mintcom and patienttoprovider communication services through our data centers we connect customers to our products and services and store customer and business information as our businesses continue to move toward delivering more online products and services in conjunction with our connected services strategy our infrastructure will become even more critical in the future 

currently we have a number of data centers primarily located in the western united states over time we expect to transition to fewer data centers in more geographically diverse locations in fiscal 2008 and 2009 we built a data center in washington state that we began occupying in the second half of fiscal 2009 we expect this data center to support the hosting and high availability requirements of many of our existing and future connected services offerings we are also executing a plan to create a new primary backup facility at a colocated data center in nevada 

privacy and security of customer information and transactions 

we are subject to various federal state and international laws and regulations and to financial institution requirements relating to the privacy and security of customer and employee personal information we are also subject to laws and regulations that apply to the internet behavioral tracking telemarketing email activities data hosting and retention financial and health information and credit reporting additional laws in all of these areas are likely to be passed in the future which could result in significant limitations on or changes to the ways in which we 

can collect use host store or transmit the personal information and data of our customers or employees communicate with our customers and deliver products and services or may significantly increase our compliance costs if our business expands to new industry segments and new uses of data that are regulated for privacy and security or to countries outside the united states that have strict data protections laws our compliance requirements and costs will increase 

through a master privacy policy framework designed to be consistent with globally recognized privacy principles we comply with united states federal and other country guidelines and practices to help ensure that customers and employees are aware of and can control how we use information about them our primary websites such as quickbookscom and turbotaxcom have been certified by truste an independent organization that operates a website privacy certification program representing industry standard practices to address users’ and regulators’ concerns about online privacy we also use privacy statements to provide notice to customers of our privacy practices as well as provide them the opportunity to furnish instructions with respect to use of their personal information we participate in industry groups whose purpose is to influence public policy and industry best practices for privacy and security 

to address security concerns we use security safeguards to help protect the systems and the information customers give to us from loss misuse and unauthorized alteration whenever customers transmit sensitive information such as a credit card number or tax return data to us through one of our websites we use industry standards to encrypt the data as it is transmitted to us we work to protect our systems from unauthorized internal or external access using numerous commercially available computer security products as well as internally developed security procedures and practices 

government regulation 

the financial services industry is subject to extensive and complex federal and state regulation our financial institution customers which include commercial banks and credit unions operate in markets that are subject to rigorous regulatory oversight and supervision the compliance of our products and services with these requirements depends on a variety of factors including the particular functionality the interactive design and the charter or license of the financial institution our financial services customers must independently assess and determine what is required of them under these regulations and are responsible for ensuring that our systems and the design of their websites conform to their regulatory obligations 

our intuit financial services business is not directly subject to federal or state regulations specifically applicable to financial institutions such as banks and credit unions however as a provider of services to financial institutions this business is examined by the federal financial institution examination council under the information technology examination guidelines although we believe we are not subject to direct supervision by federal and state banking agencies with regard to other regulations we have from time to time agreed to examinations of our business and operations by these agencies 

our consumer tax and accounting professionals businesses are also subject to federal and state government requirements including regulations related to the electronic filing of tax returns the provision of tax preparer assistance and the use and disclosure of customer information in addition we offer certain other products and services such as small business payroll payments and patienttoprovider communication solutions which are subject to special regulatory requirements as we expand our financial institutions tax and small business products and services we may become subject to additional government regulation new laws or regulations may be adopted in these areas that could impose significant limitations on our business and increase our cost of compliance we continually analyze new business opportunities both domestically and internationally and new businesses and business models that we pursue may require additional costs for regulatory compliance 

we are subject to federal and state laws and government regulations concerning employee safety and health and environmental matters the occupational safety and health administration the environmental protection agency and other federal and state agencies have the authority to put regulations in place that may have an impact on our operations 

intellectual property 

our success depends on our proprietary technology embodied in our offerings we protect this proprietary technology by relying on a variety of intellectual property mechanisms including copyright patent trade secret and trademark laws restrictions on disclosure and other methods for example we regularly file applications for patents copyrights and trademarks and service marks in order to protect intellectual property that we believe is important to our business we currently hold a small but growing patent portfolio we also have a number of registered trademarks that include intuit quickbooks turbotax lacerte proseries quicken and mint we have registered these and other trademarks and service marks in the united states and depending on the relevance of each brand to other markets in many foreign countries most registrations can be renewed perpetually at 10year intervals we also license intellectual property from third parties for use in our products 

although our portfolio of patents is growing the patents that have been issued to us could be determined to be invalid and may not be enforceable against competitive products in every jurisdiction in addition third parties have asserted and may in the future assert infringement claims against us and our customers these claims and any litigation may result in invalidation of our proprietary rights or a finding of infringement along with an assessment of damages litigation even if without merit could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention in addition third party licenses may not continue to be available to us on commercially acceptable terms or at all 

employees 

as of july 31 2010 we had approximately 7700 employees in major offices in the united states canada india the united kingdom and other locations we believe our future success and growth will depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees in all areas of our business we do not currently have any collective bargaining agreements with our employees and we believe employee relations are generally good although we have employmentrelated agreements with a number of key employees these agreements do not guarantee continued service we believe we offer competitive compensation and a good working environment we were named one of fortune magazine’s “100 best companies to work for” in each of the last nine years however we face intense competition for qualified employees and we expect to face continuing challenges in recruiting and retention

forwardlooking statements and risk factors 

this annual report on form 10k contains forwardlooking statements all statements in this report other than statements that are purely historical are forwardlooking statements words such as “expect” “anticipate” “intend” “plan” “believe” “forecast” “estimate” “seek” and similar expressions also identify forwardlooking statements in this report forwardlooking statements include without limitation the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we caution investors that forwardlooking statements are only predictions based on our current expectations about future events and are not guarantees of future performance we encourage you to read carefully all information provided in this report and in our other filings with the sec before deciding to invest in our stock or to maintain or change your investment these forwardlooking statements are based on information as of the filing date of this annual report and we undertake no obligation to revise or update any forwardlooking statement for any reason 

because forwardlooking statements involve risks and uncertainties there are important factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forwardlooking statements these factors include the following 

we face intense competitive pressures that may harm our operating results 

we face intense competition in all of our businesses and we expect competition to remain intense in the future our competitors may introduce superior products and services reduce prices have greater technical marketing and other resources have greater name recognition have larger installed bases of customers have wellestablished relationships with our current and potential customers advertise aggressively or beat us to market with new products and services we also face intensified competition from providers of free accounting tax banking and other financial services in order to compete we have also introduced free offerings in several categories but we may not be able to attract customers or effectively monetize all of these offerings and customers who have formerly paid for intuit’s products and services may elect to use free offerings instead these competitive factors may diminish our revenue and profitability and harm our ability to acquire and retain customers 

our consumer tax business also faces significant competition from the public sector where we face the risk of federal and state taxing authorities developing software or other systems to facilitate tax return preparation and electronic filing at no charge to taxpayers these or similar programs may be introduced or expanded in the future which may cause us to lose customers and revenue although the free file alliance has kept the federal government from being a direct competitor to intuit’s tax offerings it has fostered additional online competition and may cause us to lose significant revenue opportunities the current agreement with the free file alliance is scheduled to expire in october 2014 we anticipate that governmental encroachment at both the federal and state levels may present a continued competitive threat to our business for the foreseeable future 

future revenue growth depends upon our ability to adapt to technological change and successfully introduce new and enhanced products services and business models 

the software as a service saas desktop software and mobile technology industries are characterized by rapidly changing technology evolving industry standards and frequent new product introductions as we continue to grow our saas and other offerings we must continue to innovate and develop new products and features to meet changing customer needs and attract and retain talented software developers we need to continue to develop our skills tools and capabilities to capitalize on existing and emerging technologies which require us to devote significant resources 

a number of our businesses also derive a significant amount of their revenue from onetime upfront license fees and rely on customer upgrades and service offerings to generate a significant portion of their revenues in addition our consumer and professional tax businesses depend significantly on revenue from customers who return each year to use our updated tax preparation and filing software and services as our existing products mature encouraging customers to purchase product upgrades becomes more challenging unless new product releases provide features and functionality that have meaningful incremental value if we are not able to develop and clearly demonstrate the value of new or upgraded products or services to our customers our revenues may be harmed in addition as we continue to introduce and expand our new business models including offerings that are subscriptionbased or that are free to end users we may be unsuccessful in monetizing or increasing customer adoption of these offerings 

in some cases we may expend a significant amount of resources and management attention on offerings that do not ultimately succeed in their markets we have encountered difficulty in launching new products and services in the past if we misjudge customer needs in the future our new products and services may not succeed and our revenues and earnings may be harmed we have also invested and in the future expect to invest in new business models strategies and initiatives such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties including distraction of management from current operations expenses associated with the strategies and inadequate return on investments because these new initiatives are inherently risky they may not be successful and may harm our financial condition and operating results 

business interruption or failure of our information technology and communication systems may impair the availability of our products and services which may damage our reputation and harm our future financial results 

as we continue to transition our business to more connected services we become more dependent on the continuing operation and availability of our information technology and communication systems and those of our external 

service providers we do not have redundancy for all of our systems many of our critical applications reside in only one of our data centers and our disaster recovery planning may not account for all eventualities in addition we are in the process of updating our customer facing applications and the supporting information technology infrastructure to meet our customers’ expectations for continuous service availability any difficulties in upgrading these applications or infrastructure or failure of our systems or those of our service providers may result in interruptions in our service which may reduce our revenues and profits cause us to lose customers and damage our reputation any prolonged interruptions at any time may result in lost customers additional refunds of customer charges negative publicity and increased operating costs any of which may significantly harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are in the process of migrating our applications and infrastructure to new data centers if we do not execute the transition to the new data centers in an effective manner we may experience unplanned service disruptions or unforeseen increases in costs which may harm our operating results and our business we do not maintain realtime backup of all our data and in the event of significant system disruption we may experience loss of data or processing capabilities which may cause us to lose customers and may materially harm our reputation and our operating results 

our business operations data centers information technology and communications systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters human error malicious attacks fire power loss telecommunications failures computer viruses computer denial of service attacks terrorist attacks and other events beyond our control the majority of our research and development activities our corporate headquarters our principal information technology systems and other critical business operations are located near major seismic faults we do not carry earthquake insurance for direct quakerelated losses our future financial results may be materially harmed in the event of a major earthquake or other natural or manmade disaster 

we rely on internal systems and external systems maintained by manufacturers distributors and other service providers to take and fulfill customer orders handle customer service requests and host certain online activities any interruption or failure of our internal or external systems may prevent us or our service providers from accepting and fulfilling customer orders or cause company and customer data to be unintentionally disclosed our continuing efforts to upgrade and expand our network security and other information systems as well as our highavailability capabilities may be costly and problems with the design or implementation of system enhancements may harm our business and our results of operations 

our hosting collection use and retention of personal customer information and data create risk that may harm our business 

a number of our businesses collect use and retain large amounts of personal customer information and data including credit card numbers tax return information bank account numbers and passwords personal and business financial data social security numbers healthcare information and payroll information we may also develop new business models that use certain personal information or data derived from personal information in addition we collect and maintain personal information of our employees in the ordinary course of our business some of this personal customer and employee information is held and some transactions are executed by third parties in addition as many of our products and services are webbased the amount of data we store for our users on our servers including personal information has been increasing we and our vendors use commercially available security technologies to protect transactions and personal information we use security and business controls to limit access and use of personal information however individuals or third parties may be able to circumvent these security and business measures and errors in the storage use or transmission of personal information may result in a breach of customer or employee privacy or theft of assets which may require notification under applicable data privacy regulations we employ contractors temporary and seasonal employees who may have access to the personal information of customers and employees or who may execute transactions in the normal course of their duties while we conduct background checks of our employees and other individuals and limit access to systems and data it is possible that one or more of these individuals may circumvent these controls resulting in a security breach 

the ability to execute transactions and the possession and use of personal information and data in conducting our business subjects us to legislative and regulatory burdens that may require notification to customers or employees of a security breach restrict our use of personal information and hinder our ability to acquire new customers or market 

to existing customers as our business continues to expand to new industry segments that may be more highly regulated for privacy and data security and to countries outside the united states that have more strict data protection laws our compliance requirements and costs may increase we have incurred — and may continue to incur — significant expenses to comply with mandatory privacy and security standards and protocols imposed by law regulation industry standards or contractual obligations 

a major breach of our security measures or those of third parties that execute transactions or hold and manage personal information may have serious negative consequences for our businesses including possible fines penalties and damages reduced customer demand for our services harm to our reputation and brands further regulation and oversight by federal or state agencies and loss of our ability to provide financial transaction services or accept and process customer credit card orders or tax returns from time to time we detect or receive notices from customers or public or private agencies that they have detected vulnerabilities in our servers our software or thirdparty software components that are distributed with our products the existence of vulnerabilities even if they do not result in a security breach may harm customer confidence and require substantial resources to address and we may not be able to discover or remediate such security vulnerabilities before they are exploited in addition hackers develop and deploy viruses worms and other malicious software programs that may attack our offerings although this is an industrywide problem that affects software across platforms it is increasingly affecting our offerings because hackers tend to focus their efforts on the more popular programs and offerings and we expect them to continue to do so if hackers were able to circumvent our security measures we may lose personal information although we have commercially available network and application security internal control measures and physical security procedures to safeguard our systems there can be no assurance that a security breach loss or theft of personal information will not occur which may harm our business customer reputation and future financial results and may require us to expend significant resources to address these problems including notification under data privacy regulations 

if we are unable to develop manage and maintain critical third party business relationships our business may be adversely affected 

our growth is dependent on the strength of our business relationships and our ability to continue to develop maintain and leverage new and existing relationships we rely on various third party partners including software and service providers suppliers vendors manufacturers distributors financial institutions core processors licensing partners and development partners among others in many areas of our business in order to deliver our offerings and operate our business we also rely on third parties to support the operation of our business by maintaining our physical facilities equipment power systems and infrastructure in certain instances these third party relationships are sole source or limited source relationships and can be difficult to replace or substitute depending on the level of integration of the third party’s products or services into or with our offerings andor the general availability of such third party’s products and services in addition there may be few or no alternative third party providers or vendors in the market the failure of third parties to provide acceptable and high quality products services and technologies or to update their products services and technologies may result in a disruption to our business operations which may reduce our revenues and profits cause us to lose customers and damage our reputation alternative arrangements and services may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or we may experience business interruptions upon a transition to an alternative partner 

in particular we have relationships with banks credit unions or other financial institutions both as customers and as suppliers of certain critical services we offer to our other customers if macroeconomic conditions or other factors cause any of these institutions to fail consolidate or institute costcutting efforts our business and financial results may suffer and we may be unable to offer those services to our customers 

increased government regulation of our businesses may harm our operating results 

many of our businesses are in highly regulated areas including our tax payroll payments financial services and healthcare businesses the application of these laws and regulations to our businesses is often unclear and compliance with these regulations may involve significant costs or require changes to our business practices that result in reduced revenue in addition there have been significant new regulations and heightened focus by the government on many of these areas 

in addition as we seek to grow our business we may expand into more highlyregulated businesses or countries which may require increased investment in compliance and auditing functions or new technologies in order to meet regulatory standards government authorities may enact other laws rules or regulations that place new burdens or restrictions on our business or determine that our operations are directly subject to existing rules or regulations such as requirements related to data collection use transmission retention and processing which may make our business more costly less efficient or impossible to conduct and may require us to modify our current or future products or services which may harm our future financial results 

the tax preparation industry continues to receive heightened attention from federal and state governments new legislation regulation public policy considerations or litigation by the government or private entities may result in greater oversight of the tax preparation industry restrict the types of products and services that we can offer or the prices we can charge or otherwise cause us to change the way we operate our tax businesses or offer our tax products and services this in turn may increase our cost of doing business and limit our revenue opportunities we are also required to comply with a variety of state revenue agency standards in order to successfully operate our tax preparation and electronic filing services changes in stateimposed requirements by one or more of the states including the required use of specific technologies or technology standards may significantly increase the costs of providing those services to our customers and may prevent us from delivering a quality product to our customers in a timely manner 

our financial services business provides services to banks credit unions and other financial institutions that are subject to extensive and complex federal and state regulation as a result our financial institution customers require that our products and services comply with the regulations applicable to these customers if we are unable to comply with these regulations we may incur significant costs and penalties face litigation or governmental proceedings and lose our ability to sell to these customers any of these adverse events may harm our future financial results and our reputation 

if we fail to process transactions effectively or fail to adequately protect against disputed or potential fraudulent activities our revenue and earnings may be harmed 

our operations process a significant volume and dollar value of transactions on a daily basis especially in our payroll and payments businesses due to the size and volume of transactions that we handle effective processing systems and controls are essential to ensure that transactions are handled appropriately despite our efforts it is possible that we may make errors or that funds may be misappropriated due to fraud in our payroll and payments businesses we have been experiencing an increasing amount of fraudulent activities not only by our customers but also targeted fraud by third parties aimed directly at our offerings in addition to any direct damages and fines that any such problems may create which may be substantial the loss of customer confidence in our controls may seriously harm our business the systems supporting our business are comprised of multiple technology platforms that are difficult to scale if we are unable to effectively manage our systems and processes we may be unable to process customer data in an accurate reliable and timely manner which may harm our business in our payments processing service business if merchants for whom we process payment transactions are unable to pay refunds due to their customers in connection with disputed or fraudulent merchant transactions we may be required to pay those amounts and our payments may exceed the amount of the customer reserves we have established to make such payments 

third parties claiming that we infringe their proprietary rights may cause us to incur significant legal expenses and prevent us from selling our products 

as the number of products in the software industry increases and the functionality of these products further overlap and as we acquire technology through acquisitions or licenses we may become increasingly subject to infringement claims including patent copyright and trademark infringement claims litigation may be necessary to determine the validity and scope of the patent rights of others we have received an increasing number of allegations of patent infringement claims in the past and expect to receive more claims in the future based on allegations that our offerings infringe upon patents held by third parties some of these claims are the subject of pending litigation against us and against some of our customers these claims may involve patent holding companies or other adverse patent owners who have no relevant product revenues of their own and against whom our own patents may provide little or no deterrence the ultimate outcome of any allegation is uncertain and regardless of outcome any such claim with or without merit may be time consuming to defend result in costly litigation divert management’s time 

and attention from our business require us to stop selling delay shipping or redesign our products or require us to pay monetary damages for royalty or licensing fees or to satisfy indemnification obligations that we have with some of our customers our failure to obtain necessary license or other rights or litigation arising out of intellectual property claims may harm our business 

we rely on third party intellectual property in our products and services 

many of our products and services include intellectual property of third parties which we license under agreements that must be renewed or renegotiated from time to time we may not be able to obtain licenses to these third party technologies or content on reasonable terms or at all if we are unable to obtain the rights necessary to use this intellectual property in our products and services we may not be able to sell the affected offerings which may in turn harm our future financial results also we and our customers have been and may continue to be subject to infringement claims as a result of the third party intellectual property incorporated in to our offerings although we try to mitigate this risk and we may not be ultimately liable for any potential infringement pending claims require us to use significant resources require management attention and could result in loss of customers 

some of our offerings include thirdparty software that is licensed under socalled “open source” licenses some of which may include a requirement that under certain circumstances we make available or grant licenses to any modifications or derivative works we create based upon the open source software although we have established internal review and approval processes to mitigate these risks we may not be sure that all open source software is submitted for approval prior to use in our products many of the risks associated with usage of open source may not be eliminated and may if not properly addressed harm our business 

we expect copying and misuse of our intellectual property to be a persistent problem which may cause lost revenue and increased expenses 

policing unauthorized use and copying of our products is difficult expensive and time consuming current us laws that prohibit copying give us only limited practical protection from software piracy and the laws of many other countries provide very little protection we frequently encounter unauthorized copies of our software being sold through online marketplaces although we continue to evaluate and put in place technology solutions to attempt to lessen the impact of piracy and engage in efforts to educate consumers and public policy leaders on these issues and cooperate with industry groups in their efforts to combat piracy we expect piracy to be a persistent problem that results in lost revenues and increased expenses 

because competition for our key employees is intense we may not be able to attract retain and develop the highly skilled employees we need to support our planned growth 

much of our future success depends on the continued service and availability of skilled personnel including members of our executive team and those in technical marketing and staff positions experienced personnel in the software and software as a service industries are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense especially in california and india where the majority of our employees are located also as we strive to continue to adapt to technological change and introduce new and enhanced products and business models we must be able to secure maintain and develop the right quality and quantity of engaged and committed talent although we strive to be an employer of choice we may not be able to continue to successfully attract retain and develop key personnel which may cause our business to suffer 

as our product and service offerings become more tightly integrated we may be required to recognize the related revenue over relatively longer periods of time 

our expanding range of products and services and the combinations in which we offer them generate different revenue streams than our traditional desktop software businesses and the accounting policies that apply to revenue from these offerings are complex for example as we offer online services bundled with other products we may be required to defer a higher percentage of our product revenue into future fiscal periods in addition as we offer more services on a subscription basis we recognize revenue from those services over the periods in which the services are provided this may result in significant shifts of revenue from quarter to quarter or from one fiscal year to the next 

the nature of our products and services necessitates timely product launches and if we experience significant product quality problems or delays it may harm our revenue earnings and reputation 

all of our tax products and many of our nontax products have rigid development timetables that increase the risk of errors in our products and the risk of launch delays our tax preparation software product development cycle is particularly challenging due to the need to incorporate unpredictable tax law and tax form changes each year and because our customers expect high levels of accuracy and a timely launch of these products to prepare and file their taxes by the tax filing deadline due to the complexity of our products and the condensed development cycles under which we operate our products sometimes contain “bugs” that may unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the software the complexity of our products may also make it difficult for us to consistently deliver offerings that contain the features functionality and level of accuracy that our customers expect when we encounter problems we may be required to modify our code distribute patches to customers who have already purchased the product and recall or repackage existing product inventory in our distribution channels if we encounter development challenges or discover errors in our products late in our development cycle it may cause us to delay our product launch date any major defects or launch delays may lead to loss of customers and revenue negative publicity customer and employee dissatisfaction reduced retailer shelf space and promotions and increased operating expenses such as inventory replacement costs legal fees or payments resulting from our commitment to reimburse penalties and interest paid by customers due solely to calculation errors in our consumer tax preparation products 

our revenue and earnings are highly seasonal and our quarterly results fluctuate significantly 

several of our businesses are highly seasonal causing significant quarterly fluctuations in our financial results revenue and operating results are usually strongest during the second and third fiscal quarters ending january 31 and april 30 due to our tax businesses contributing most of their revenue during those quarters and the timing of the release of our small business software products and upgrades we experience lower revenues and significant operating losses in the first and fourth quarters ending october 31 and july 31 our financial results may also fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year due to a variety of factors including changes in product sales mix that affect average selling prices product release dates the timing of delivery of federal and state tax forms the timing of our discontinuation of support for older product offerings changes to our bundling strategy such as the inclusion of upgrades with certain offerings changes to how we communicate the availability of new functionality in the future any of which may impact the pattern of revenue recognition and the timing of acquisitions divestitures and goodwill and acquired intangible asset impairment charges 

we are frequently a party to litigation and regulatory inquiries which could result in an unfavorable outcome and have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operation and cash flows 

we are subject to various legal proceedings claims and regulatory inquiries that have arisen out of the ordinary conduct of our business and are not yet resolved and additional claims and inquiries may arise in the future the number and significance of these claims and inquiries have increased as our businesses have evolved any proceedings claims or inquiries initiated by or against us whether successful or not may be time consuming result in costly litigation damage awards injunctive relief or increased costs of business require us to change our business practices require significant amounts of management time result in diversion of significant operations resources or otherwise harm of business and future financial results 

the continued global economic downturn may harm our business and financial condition 

the continued global economic downturn has caused disruptions and extreme volatility in global financial markets and increased rates of default and bankruptcy and has impacted consumer and small business spending these macroeconomic developments have affected and may continue to negatively affect our business and financial condition in particular because the majority of our revenue is derived from sales within the us economic conditions in the us have an even greater impact on us than companies with a more diverse international presence potential new customers may not purchase or delay purchase of our products and services and many of our existing customers may discontinue purchasing or delay upgrades of our existing products and services thereby negatively impacting our revenues and future financial results decreased consumer spending levels may also reduce credit and debit card transaction processing volumes causing reductions in our payments revenue poor economic conditions and high unemployment has caused and may continue to cause a significant decrease in the number of tax returns 

filed which may have a significant effect on the number of tax returns we prepare and file in addition weakness in the enduser consumer and small business markets may negatively affect the cash flow of our distributors and resellers who may in turn delay paying their obligations to us which may increase our credit risk exposure and cause delays in our recognition of revenue or future sales to these customers additionally if macroeconomic or other factors continue to cause banks credit unions mortgage lenders and other financial institutions to fail or result in further costcutting efforts or consolidation of these entities we may lose current or potential customers achieve less revenue per customer andor lose valuable relationships with such of these entities that provide critical services to our customers any of these events may harm our business and our future financial results 

we regularly invest resources to update and improve our internal information technology systems and software platforms should our investments not succeed or if delays or other issues with new or existing internal technology systems and software platforms disrupt our operations our business could be harmed 

we rely on our network and data center infrastructure and internal technology systems for many of our development marketing operational support sales accounting and financial reporting activities we are continually investing resources to update and improve these systems and environments in order to meet existing as well as the growing and changing requirements of our business and customers if we experience prolonged delays or unforeseen difficulties in updating and upgrading our systems and architecture we may experience outages and may not be able to deliver certain offerings and develop new offerings and enhancements that we need to remain competitive such improvements and upgrades are often complex costly and time consuming in addition such improvements can be challenging to integrate with our existing technology systems or may uncover problems with our existing technology systems unsuccessful implementation of hardware or software updates and improvements could result in outages disruption in our business operations loss of revenue or damage to our reputation 

our international operations are subject to increased risks which may harm our business operating results and financial condition 

in addition to uncertainty about our ability to generate revenues from our foreign operations and expand into international markets there are risks inherent in doing business internationally including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

violations of the complex foreign and us laws and regulations that apply to our international operations may result in fines criminal actions or sanctions against us our officers or our employees prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with these laws there can be no assurance that our employees contractors or agents will not violate our policies these risks inherent in our international operations and expansion increase our costs of doing business internationally and may result in harm to our business operating results and financial condition 

if actual product returns exceed returns reserves our future financial results may be harmed 

we ship more desktop software products to our distributors and retailers than we expect them to sell in order to reduce the risk that distributors or retailers may run out of products this is particularly true for our consumer tax products which have a short selling season and for which returns occur primarily in our fiscal third and fourth quarters like many software companies that sell their products through distributors and retailers we have historically accepted significant product returns we establish reserves against revenue for product returns in our financial statements based on estimated returns and we closely monitor product sales and inventory in the retail 

channel in an effort to maintain adequate reserves in the past returns have not differed significantly from these reserves however if we experience actual returns that significantly exceed reserves it may result in lower net revenue 

unanticipated changes in our income tax rates may affect our future financial results 

our future effective income tax rates may be favorably or unfavorably affected by unanticipated changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or by changes in tax laws or their interpretation in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes these continuous examinations may result in unforeseen taxrelated liabilities which may harm our future financial results 

amortization of acquired intangible assets and impairment charges may cause significant fluctuation in our net income 

our acquisitions have resulted in significant expenses including amortization and impairment of acquired technology and other acquired intangible assets and impairment of goodwill total costs and expenses in these categories were approximately 91 million in fiscal 2010 101 million in fiscal 2009 and 90 million in fiscal 2008 although under current accounting rules goodwill is not amortized we may incur impairment charges related to the goodwill already recorded and to goodwill arising out of future acquisitions we test the impairment of goodwill annually in our fourth fiscal quarter or more frequently if indicators of impairment arise the timing of the formal annual test may result in charges to our statement of operations in our fourth fiscal quarter that may not have been reasonably foreseen in prior periods at july 31 2010 we had 19 billion in goodwill and 256 million in net acquired intangible assets on our balance sheet both of which may be subject to impairment charges in the future new acquisitions and any impairment of the value of acquired intangible assets may have a significant negative impact on our future financial results 

our acquisition and divestiture activities may disrupt our ongoing business may involve increased expenses and may present risks not contemplated at the time of the transactions 

we have acquired and may continue to acquire companies products and technologies that complement our strategic direction acquisitions involve significant risks and uncertainties including 

 

 

 

 

 

because acquisitions and divestitures are inherently risky our transactions may not be successful and may in some cases harm our operating results or financial condition if we use debt to fund acquisitions or for other purposes our interest expense and leverage may increase significantly if we issue equity securities as consideration in an acquisition current shareholders’ percentage ownership and earnings per share may be diluted 

we have issued 1 billion in a debt offering and may incur other debt in the future which may adversely affect our financial condition and future financial results 

in fiscal 2007 we issued 500 million in senior unsecured notes due in march 2012 and 500 million in senior unsecured notes due in march 2017 as this debt matures we will have to expend significant resources to either repay or refinance these notes if we decide to refinance the notes we may be required to do so on different or less favorable terms or we may be unable to refinance the notes at all both of which may adversely affect our financial condition 

we have also entered into a 500 million fiveyear revolving credit facility although we have no current plans to request any advances under this credit facility we may use the proceeds of any future borrowing for general corporate purposes or for future acquisitions or expansion of our business 

this debt may adversely affect our financial condition and future financial results by among other things 

 

 

 

our current revolving credit facility imposes restrictions on us including restrictions on our ability to create liens on our assets and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur indebtedness and require us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios our ability to comply with these ratios may be affected by events beyond our control in addition our longterm nonconvertible debt includes covenants that may adversely affect our ability to incur certain liens or engage in certain types of sale and leaseback transactions if we breach any of the covenants under our longterm debt or our revolving credit facility and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders then subject to applicable cure periods any outstanding indebtedness may be declared immediately due and payable 

in addition changes by any rating agency to our credit rating may negatively impact the value and liquidity of both our debt and equity securities if our credit ratings are downgraded or other negative action is taken the interest rate payable by us under our revolving credit facility may increase in addition any downgrades in our credit ratings may affect our ability to obtain additional financing in the future and may affect the terms of any such financing 

we are subject to risks associated with information disseminated through our services 

the law relating to the liability of online services companies for information carried on or disseminated through their services is often unsettled claims may be made against online services companies under both us and foreign law for defamation libel invasion of privacy negligence copyright or trademark infringement or other theories based on the nature and content of the materials disseminated through their services certain of our services include content generated by users although this content is not generated by us claims of defamation or other injury may be made against us for that content any costs incurred as a result of this potential liability may harm our business 

our business depends on our strong reputation and the value of our brands 

developing and maintaining awareness of our brands is critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our existing and future products and services and is an important element in attracting new customers adverse publicity whether or not justified relating to activities by our employees or agents may tarnish our reputation and reduce the value of our brands damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity may reduce demand for our products and services and thus have an adverse effect on our future financial results as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of the brands

 item 7 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda includes the following sections 

 

you should note that this mda discussion contains forwardlooking statements that involve risks and uncertainties please see the section entitled “forwardlooking statements and risk factors” at the beginning of item 1a for important information to consider when evaluating such statements 

you should read this mda in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes in item 8 of this report in fiscal 2008 we acquired homestead technologies inc and electronic clearing house inc echo in fiscal 2009 we acquired paycycle inc and in fiscal 2010 we acquired mint software inc and medfusion inc we have included the results of operations for each of them in our consolidated results of operations from their respective dates of acquisition 

we have reclassified our financial statements for all periods presented to reflect our intuit distribution management solutions and intuit real estate solutions businesses as discontinued operations see “results of operations — discontinued operations and dispositions” later in this item 7 for more information unless otherwise noted the following discussion pertains only to our continuing operations 

executive overview 

this overview provides a high level discussion of our operating results and some of the trends that affect our business we believe that an understanding of these trends is important in order to understand our financial results for fiscal 2010 as well as our future prospects this summary is not intended to be exhaustive nor is it intended to be a substitute for the detailed discussion and analysis provided elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

overview of financial results 

total net revenue for fiscal 2010 was 35 billion an increase of 11 compared with fiscal 2009 revenue was higher in all of our business segments consumer tax segment revenue increased 150 million or 15 due to growth in turbotax online units operating income from continuing operations increased 26 in fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009 cost of service and other revenue as a percentage of related revenue was slightly lower in fiscal 2010 due to unit growth in turbotax online units operating expenses increased due to incentive compensation that was directly related to our financial results and the addition of operating expenses for acquired businesses net income from continuing operations increased 21 in fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009 our effective tax rate for fiscal 2010 was approximately 34 and our effective tax rate for fiscal 2009 was approximately 31 due to all of the foregoing factors diluted net income per share from continuing operations of 166 for fiscal 2010 grew 23 compared with fiscal 2009 

we ended fiscal 2010 with cash cash equivalents and investments totaling 16 billion in fiscal 2010 we generated cash from operations from the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans and from the sale of our intuit real estate solutions business during the same period we used cash for the repurchase of shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs for net purchases of investments for the acquisitions of mint and medfusion and for capital expenditures at july 31 2010 we had expended all funds authorized by our board of directors for stock repurchases on august 19 2010 we announced a new stock repurchase program under which we are authorized to repurchase up to an additional 2 billion of our common stock from time to time over a threeyear period ending on august 16 2013 

seasonality 

our quickbooks consumer tax and accounting professionals offerings are highly seasonal revenue from our quickbooks software products tends to be highest during our second and third fiscal quarters sales of income tax preparation products and services are heavily concentrated in the period from november through april in our consumer tax business a greater proportion of our revenue has been occurring later in this seasonal period due in part to the growth in sales of turbotax online for which revenue is recognized upon printing or electronic filing of a tax return these seasonal patterns mean that our total net revenue is usually highest during our second quarter ending january 31 and third quarter ending april 30 we typically report losses in our first quarter ending october 31 and fourth quarter ending july 31 when revenue from our tax businesses is minimal while operating expenses continue at relatively consistent levels we believe the seasonality of our revenue and profitability is likely to continue in the future 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

in preparing our financial statements we make estimates assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on our net revenue operating income or loss and net income or loss as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our balance sheet we believe that the estimates assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies senior management has reviewed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and their disclosure in this annual report on form 10k with the audit and risk committee of our board of directors 

revenue recognition 

we derive revenue from the sale of packaged software products license fees software subscriptions product support hosting services payroll services merchant services professional services transaction fees and multiple element arrangements that may include any combination of these items we follow the appropriate revenue recognition rules for each type of revenue for additional information see “revenue recognition” in note 1 to the financial statements in item 8 of this report we generally recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists we have delivered the product or performed the service the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable however determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report for example for multiple element arrangements we must make assumptions and judgments in order to allocate the total price among the various elements we must deliver to determine whether undelivered services are essential to the functionality of the delivered products and services to determine whether vendorspecific evidence of fair value exists for each undelivered element and to determine whether and when each element has been delivered if we were to change any of these assumptions or judgments it could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period amounts for fees collected or invoiced and due relating to arrangements where revenue cannot be recognized are reflected on our balance sheet as deferred revenue and recognized when the applicable revenue recognition criteria are satisfied 

in connection with the sale of certain products we provide a limited amount of free technical support assistance to customers we do not defer the recognition of any revenue associated with sales of these products since the cost of providing this free technical support is insignificant the technical support is generally provided within one year after the associated revenue is recognized and free product enhancements are minimal and infrequent we accrue the estimated cost of providing this free support upon product shipment 

return and rebate reserves 

as part of our revenue recognition policy we estimate future product returns and rebate payments and establish reserves against revenue at the time of sale based on these estimates our return policy allows distributors and retailers subject to contractual limitations to return purchased products product returns by distributors and retailers relate primarily to the return of excess and obsolete products in determining our product returns reserves we consider the volume and price mix of products in the retail channel historical return rates for prior releases of the 

product trends in retailer inventory and economic trends that might impact customer demand for our products including the competitive environment and the timing of new releases of our products we fully reserve for excess and obsolete products in the distribution channels 

our rebate reserves include distributor and retailer sales incentive rebates and enduser rebates our estimated reserves for distributor and retailer incentive rebates are based on distributors’ and retailers’ actual performance against the terms and conditions of rebate programs which we typically establish annually our reserves for enduser rebates are estimated based on the terms and conditions of the specific promotional rebate program actual sales during the promotion and historical redemption trends by product and by type of promotional program 

in the past actual returns and rebates have not differed significantly from the reserves that we have established however actual returns and rebates in any future period are inherently uncertain if we were to change our assumptions and estimates our revenue reserves would change which would impact the net revenue we report if actual returns and rebates are significantly greater than the reserves we have established the actual results would decrease our future reported revenue conversely if actual returns and rebates are significantly less than our reserves this would increase our future reported revenue for example if we had increased our fiscal 2010 returns reserves by 1 of nonconsignment sales to retailers for quickbooks turbotax and quicken our total net revenue for fiscal 2010 would have been about 3 million lower 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

we make ongoing assumptions relating to the collectibility of our accounts receivable the accounts receivable amounts presented on our balance sheets include reserves for accounts that might not be paid in determining the amount of these reserves we consider our historical level of credit losses we also make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations and we assess current economic trends that might impact the level of credit losses in the future our reserves have generally been adequate to cover our actual credit losses however since we cannot reliably predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers we cannot guarantee that our reserves will continue to be adequate if actual credit losses are significantly greater than the reserve we have established that would increase our general and administrative expenses and reduce our reported net income conversely if actual credit losses are significantly less than our reserve this would eventually decrease our general and administrative expenses and increase our reported net income we had a total of 157 million in gross accounts receivable on our balance sheet at july 31 2010 

fair value of investments 

as described in note 2 to the financial statements in item 8 of this report we estimate the fair value of our availableforsale securities each quarter these investments consist of cash equivalents municipal bonds us treasury securities us agency securities corporate notes and municipal auction rate securities fair value is defined as the price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date when identical or similar assets are traded in active markets the level of judgment required to estimate their fair value is relatively low this is generally true for our cash equivalents which we consider to be level 1 assets and our municipal bonds us agency securities and corporate notes which we consider to be level 2 assets however significant judgment is required to estimate the fair value of assets and liabilities when observable inputs are not available level 3 for example we use a discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of our municipal auction rate securities because we have determined that the market for those securities is inactive we based this determination on the fact that due to a decrease in liquidity in the global credit markets regularly scheduled auctions for the municipal auction rate securities we hold have generally failed since february 2008 some of the key inputs to our discounted cash flow model are inherently uncertain the key inputs include projected future interest rates the likely timing of principal repayments the probability of full repayment publicly available pricing data for recently issued similar securities that are not subject to auctions and the impact of the reduced liquidity for auction rate securities at july 31 2010 we held a total of 87 million in municipal auction rate securities 

we record unrealized gains and losses on our availableforsale securities in other comprehensive income in the equity section of our balance sheet until the security is sold or we determine that the decrease in fair value is otherthantemporary we consider a number of factors in determining whether to recognize an impairment charge including the reason for the decrease in fair value the severity of the decrease in fair value the length of time that 

the fair value has been less than the cost basis of the security the financial condition and nearterm prospects of the issuer and whether we intend to sell or may be required to sell the security before anticipated recovery of our cost basis changes in our estimates of the fair values of our availableforsale securities may result in material increases or decreases in our net income in the period in which the change occurs 

fair value of nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities 

we estimate the fair values of nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that we do not recognize or disclose at fair value on a recurring basis at least annually in accordance with authoritative guidance these include nonfinancial assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination reporting units measured at fair value in a goodwill impairment test and other nonfinancial assets or liabilities measured at fair value for impairment testing 

we define fair value as the price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date given the nature of nonfinancial assets and liabilities evaluating their fair value from the perspective of a market participant is inherently complex for example if there are no known markets or we do not have access to any markets we are required to identify hypothetical market participants and develop a hypothetical market based on the expected assumptions of those market participants in addition we are required to consider and use all appropriate valuation methods using multiple valuation methods can yield a range of possible results which we must evaluate in order to choose the most representative point within the range 

assumptions and estimates about future values can be affected by a variety of internal and external factors changes in these factors may require us to revise our estimates and record future impairment charges for goodwill and acquired intangible assets or retroactively adjust provisional amounts that we have recorded for the fair values of assets and liabilities in connection with business combinations these charges and adjustments could materially decrease our operating income and net income and result in lower asset values on our balance sheet 

business combinations 

as described in note 1 “description of business and summary of significant accounting policies — business combinations” in item 8 of this report under the acquisition method of accounting we generally recognize the identifiable assets acquired the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interests in an acquiree at their fair values as of the date of acquisition we measure goodwill as the excess of consideration transferred which we also measure at fair value over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed the acquisition method of accounting requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions regarding the fair values of the elements of a business combination as of the date of acquisition including the fair values of identifiable intangible assets deferred tax asset valuation allowances liabilities related to uncertain tax positions and contingencies this method also requires us to refine these estimates over a oneyear measurement period to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that if known would have affected the measurement of the amounts recognized as of that date if we are required to retroactively adjust provisional amounts that we have recorded for the fair values of assets and liabilities in connection with acquisitions these adjustments could materially decrease our operating income and net income and result in lower asset values on our balance sheet 

significant estimates and assumptions in estimating the fair value of acquired technology customer lists and other identifiable intangible assets include future cash flows that we expect to generate from the acquired assets if the subsequent actual results and updated projections of the underlying business activity change compared with the assumptions and projections used to develop these values we could record impairment charges in addition we have estimated the economic lives of certain acquired assets and these lives are used to calculate depreciation and amortization expense if our estimates of the economic lives change depreciation or amortization expenses could be accelerated or slowed 

goodwill acquired intangible assets and other longlived assets — impairment assessments 

we estimate the fair value of acquired intangible assets and other longlived assets that have finite useful lives whenever an event or change in circumstances indicates that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable we test for potential impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives annually in our fourth fiscal quarter or whenever indicators of impairment arise the timing of the annual test may result in charges to our statement of operations in our fourth fiscal quarter that could not have been reasonably foreseen in prior periods 

as described in note 1 to the financial statements in item 8 of this report in order to estimate the fair value of goodwill we use a weighted combination of a discounted cash flow model known as the income approach and comparisons to publicly traded companies engaged in similar businesses known as the market approach the income approach requires us to use a number of assumptions including market factors specific to the business the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows to be generated by the business over an extended period of time longterm growth rates for the business and a rate of return that considers the relative risk of achieving the cash flows and the time value of money we evaluate cash flows at the reporting unit level and the number of reporting units that we have identified may make impairment more probable than it would be at a company with fewer reporting units and more integrated operations following acquisitions although the assumptions we use in our discounted cash flow model are consistent with the assumptions we use to generate our internal strategic plans and forecasts significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of future cash flows from each reporting unit and the relative risk of achieving those cash flows when using the market approach we make judgments about the comparability of publicly traded companies engaged in similar businesses we base our judgments on factors such as size growth rates profitability risk and return on investment we also make judgments when adjusting market multiples of revenue operating income and earnings for these companies to reflect their relative similarity to our own businesses we had a total of 19 billion in goodwill on our balance sheet at july 31 2010 see note 5 to the financial statements in item 8 of this report for a summary of goodwill by reportable segment 

we estimate the recoverability of acquired intangible assets and other longlived assets that have finite useful lives by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows that we expect the asset to generate in order to estimate the fair value of those assets we estimate the present value of future cash flows from those assets the key assumptions that we use in our discounted cash flow model are the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows to be generated by the asset over an extended period of time and a rate of return that considers the relative risk of achieving the cash flows and the time value of money significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of future cash flows and the relative risk of achieving those cash flows we also make judgments about the remaining useful lives of acquired intangible assets and other longlived assets that have finite lives we had a total of 256 million in net acquired intangible assets on our balance sheet at july 31 2010 

assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives are complex and often subjective they can be affected by a variety of factors including external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts for example if our future operating results do not meet current forecasts or if we experience a sustained decline in our market capitalization that is determined to be indicative of a reduction in fair value of one or more of our reporting units we may be required to record future impairment charges for goodwill and acquired intangible assets impairment charges could materially decrease our future net income and result in lower asset values on our balance sheet 

in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 we performed our annual goodwill impairment test as described in note 1 “description of business and summary of significant accounting policies – goodwill acquired intangible assets and other longlived assets” in step one of that test we compared the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value the estimated fair values of all of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values and we concluded that they were not impaired consequently we recorded no goodwill impairment charges for the twelve months ended july 31 2010 

during our fiscal 2010 goodwill impairment analysis we concluded that the estimated fair values of all of our reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying values the estimated fair value of our financial services reporting unit exceeded its carrying value of 11 billion by approximately 18 compared with approximately 5 

in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 in the course of estimating the fair value of our financial services reporting unit we considered the extent to which it was consistently meeting or exceeding internal financial expectations and key business milestones and the extent to which it was consistently meeting or exceeding the financial performance of similar lines of business within comparable companies the fiscal 2010 increase in fair value for this reporting unit was predominantly due to increases in revenue operating income and earnings multiples for comparable publicly traded companies engaged in similar businesses which are key inputs to the market approach analysis that we perform 

as discussed above estimates of fair value for all of our reporting units can be affected by a variety of external and internal factors the recent global economic downturn has caused significant disruptions in global financial markets and in the banking and financial services industry potential events or circumstances that could reasonably be expected to negatively affect the key assumptions we used in estimating the fair value of our financial institutions reporting unit include the consolidation or failure of financial institutions which may result in a smaller market for our products and services and may cause us to lose relationships with key customers and costcutting efforts by financial institutions which may cause us to lose current or potential customers or achieve less revenue per customer if the estimated fair value of our financial institutions reporting unit declines due to any of these factors we may be required to record future goodwill impairment charges 

accounting for sharebased compensation plans 

at july 31 2010 there was 280 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested sharebased compensation arrangements granted under all equity compensation plans which we will amortize to expense in the future total unrecognized compensation cost will be adjusted for future changes in estimated forfeitures we expect to recognize that cost over a weighted average vesting period of 21 years 

we use a lattice binomial model and the assumptions described in note 12 to the financial statements in item 8 of this report to estimate the fair value of stock options granted we estimate the expected term of options granted based on implied exercise patterns using a binomial model we estimate the volatility of our common stock at the date of grant based on the implied volatility of publicly traded oneyear and twoyear options on our common stock our decision to use implied volatility was based upon the availability of actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility we base the riskfree interest rate that we use in our option valuation model on the implied yield in effect at the time of option grant on constant maturity us treasury issues with equivalent remaining terms we have never paid any cash dividends on our common stock and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future consequently we use an expected dividend yield of zero in our option valuation model we estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates we use historical data to estimate prevesting option forfeitures and record sharebased compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest we amortize the fair value of options on a straightline basis over the requisite service periods of the awards which are generally the vesting periods we may elect to use different assumptions under our option valuation model in the future which could materially affect our net income or loss and net income or loss per share 

restricted stock units rsus granted typically vest based on continued service we value these timebased rsus at the date of grant using the intrinsic value method and amortize those values on a straightline basis adjusted for estimated forfeitures over the restriction period certain rsus granted to senior management vest based on the achievement of preestablished performance or market goals we estimate the fair value of performancebased rsus at the date of grant using the intrinsic value method and the probability that the specified performance criteria will be met we amortize those fair values over the requisite service period adjusted for estimated forfeitures for each separately vesting tranche of the award we estimate the fair value of marketbased rsus at the date of grant using a monte carlo valuation methodology and amortize those fair values over the requisite service period adjusted for estimated forfeitures for each separately vesting tranche of the award 

legal contingencies 

we are subject to certain legal proceedings as well as demands claims and threatened litigation that arise in the normal course of our business we review the status of each significant matter quarterly and assess our potential financial exposure if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount 

can be reasonably estimated we record a liability and an expense for the estimated loss significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination of whether an exposure is reasonably estimable our accruals are based on the best information available at the time as additional information becomes available we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates potential legal liabilities and the revision of estimates of potential legal liabilities could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations

we estimate our income taxes based on the various jurisdictions where we conduct business significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax rules and the potential for future adjustment of our uncertain tax positions by the united states internal revenue service or other taxing jurisdictions we estimate our current tax liability and assess temporary differences that result from differing treatments of certain items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which we show on our balance sheet we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized to the extent we believe that realization is not likely we establish a valuation allowance when we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in an accounting period we record a corresponding tax expense in our statement of operations 

at july 31 2010 we had net deferred tax assets of 158 million which included a valuation allowance of 8 million for certain state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards we recorded the valuation allowance to reflect uncertainties about whether we will be able to utilize some of our deferred tax assets before they expire the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income for the jurisdictions in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be realizable while we have considered future taxable income in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we could in the future be required to increase the valuation allowance to take into account additional deferred tax assets that we may be unable to realize an increase in the valuation allowance would have an adverse impact which could be material on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which we record the increase 

we recognize and measure benefits for uncertain tax positions using a twostep approach the first step is to evaluate the tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon audit including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes for tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely of being realized upon settlement significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions we evaluate our uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis our evaluations are based upon a number of factors including changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law correspondence with tax authorities during the course of audits and effective settlement of audit issues changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in material increases or decreases in our income tax expense in the period in which we make the change which could have a material impact on our effective tax rate and operating results

auction rate securities 

at july 31 2010 we held a total of 87 million in municipal auction rate securities which we classified as longterm investments based on the maturities of the underlying securities all of these securities are rated a or better by the major credit rating agencies and are generally collateralized by student loans guaranteed by the us department of education due to a decrease in liquidity in the global credit markets in february 2008 auctions began failing for the municipal auction rate securities we held and in accordance with authoritative guidance we began estimating their fair value based on a discounted cash flow model that we prepared see note 2 to the financial statements in item 8 of this report for more information in november 2008 we accepted an offer from ubs ag ubs one of the brokerdealers for our municipal auction rate securities which gave us the option to sell ubs all of the municipal auction rate securities that we held through them at par in june 2010 ubs settled the remaining balance of 110 million in municipal auction rate securities subject to the offer at par based on our expected operating cash flows and our other sources of cash we do not believe that the reduction in liquidity of the municipal auction rate securities we held at july 31 2010 will have a material impact on our overall ability to meet our liquidity needs

on march 22 2007 we entered into an agreement with certain institutional lenders for a 500 million unsecured revolving credit facility that will expire on march 22 2012 advances under the credit facility will accrue interest at rates that are equal to at our election either citibank’s base rate or the london interbank offered rate libor plus a margin that ranges from 018 to 0575 based on our senior debt credit ratings the applicable interest rate will be increased by 005 for any period in which the total principal amount of advances and letters of credit under the credit facility exceeds 250 million the agreement includes covenants that require us to maintain a ratio of total debt to annual earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda of not greater than 325 to 100 and a ratio of annual ebitda to interest payable of not less than 300 to 100 we were in compliance with these covenants at july 31 2010 we may use amounts borrowed under this credit facility for general corporate purposes or for future acquisitions or expansion of our business to date we have not borrowed under the credit facility we monitor counterparty risk associated with the institutional lenders that are providing the credit facility we currently believe that the credit facility will be available to us should we choose to borrow under it

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

investment portfolio 

there has been significant deterioration and instability in the financial markets during fiscal 2009 and 2010 this period of extraordinary disruption and readjustment in the financial markets exposes us to additional investment risk the value and liquidity of the securities in which we invest could deteriorate rapidly and the issuers of these securities could be subject to credit rating downgrades in light of the current market conditions and these additional risks we actively monitor market conditions and developments specific to the securities in which we invest we believe that we take a conservative approach to investing our funds in that we invest only in highlyrated securities and diversify our portfolio of investments while we believe we take prudent measures to mitigate investment related risks such risks cannot be fully eliminated because of market circumstances that are outside our control 

our investments consist of instruments that meet quality standards that are consistent with our investment policy this policy specifies that except for direct obligations of the united states government securities issued by agencies of the united states government and money market funds we diversify our investments by limiting our holdings with any individual issuer we do not hold derivative financial instruments in our portfolio of investments 

the following table presents our portfolio of cash equivalents and availableforsale debt securities as of july 31 2010 by stated maturity the table is classified by the original maturity date listed on the security and includes cash equivalents which consist primarily of money market funds at july 31 2010 the weighted average tax adjusted interest rate earned on our money market accounts was 042 and the weighted average tax adjusted interest rate earned on our investments was 110 

 

interest rate risk 

our cash equivalents and investments are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates interest rate movements affect the interest income we earn on cash equivalents and investments and the value of those investments should the federal reserve target rate increase by 25 basis points from the level of july 31 2010 the value of our investments would decrease by approximately 3 million should the federal reserve target rate increase by 100 basis points from the level of july 31 2010 the value of our investments would decrease by approximately 11 million 

we are also exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates as they affect our 500 million revolving credit facility advances under the credit facility accrue interest at rates that are equal to citibank’s base rate or the london interbank offered rate libor plus a margin that ranges from 018 to 0575 based on our senior debt credit ratings consequently our interest expense would fluctuate with changes in the general level of these interest rates if we were to borrow any amounts under the credit facility at july 31 2010 no amounts were outstanding under the credit facility 

on march 12 2007 we issued 500 million of 540 senior unsecured notes due on march 15 2012 and 500 million of 575 senior unsecured notes due on march 15 2017 we carry these senior notes at face value less unamortized discount on our balance sheets since these senior notes bear interest at fixed rates we have no financial statement risk associated with changes in interest rates however the fair value of these notes fluctuates when interest rates change see note 2 and note 10 to the financial statements in part 8 of this report for more information 

impact of foreign currency rate changes 

the functional currencies of our international operating subsidiaries are generally the local currencies we translate the assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries at the exchange rates in effect on the balance sheet date we translate their revenue costs and expenses at the average rates of exchange in effect during the period we include translation gains and losses in the stockholders’ equity section of our balance sheets we include net gains and losses resulting from foreign exchange transactions in interest and other income in our statements of operations 

since we translate foreign currencies primarily canadian dollars british pounds indian rupees and singapore dollars into us dollars for financial reporting purposes currency fluctuations can have an impact on our financial results the historical impact of currency fluctuations has generally been immaterial we believe that our exposure to currency exchange fluctuation risk is not significant primarily because our global subsidiaries invoice customers and satisfy their financial obligations almost exclusively in their local currencies although the impact of currency fluctuations on our financial results has generally been immaterial in the past and we believe that for the reasons cited above currency fluctuations will not be significant in the future there can be no guarantee that the impact of currency fluctuations will not be material in the future as of july 31 2010 we did not engage in foreign currency hedging activities

product development 

since the markets for software and related services are characterized by rapid technological change shifting customer needs and frequent new product introductions and enhancements a continuous high level of investment is required to innovate and quickly develop new products and services as well as enhance existing offerings our product development efforts are becoming more important than ever as we pursue our connected services strategy which reflects a world where people and businesses are increasingly connected by technology and expect access to services at any time in any place 

we develop the majority of our products and services internally we have a number of united states patents and pending applications that relate to various aspects of our products and technology we also supplement our internal development efforts by acquiring or licensing products and technology from third parties and establishing other relationships that enable us to enhance or expand our offerings more rapidly we expect to expand our third party technology relationships as we continue to pursue our connected services strategy 

our traditional core desktop software products – quickbooks turbotax lacerte proseries and quicken — tend to have predictable annual development and product release cycles we also develop innovative new offerings such as intuit gopayment and quicken mobile for which development cycles can be more rapid developing consumer and professional tax software and services presents unique challenges because of the demanding development cycle required to accurately incorporate tax law and tax form changes within a rigid timetable the development timing for our payroll merchant services and financial institutions offerings varies with business needs and regulatory requirements and the length of the development cycle depends on the scope and complexity of each particular project 

in our financial institutions business we have developed interfaces with the systems of many of the major providers of core processing software and services to financial institutions these system interfaces allow us to access a financial institution’s host system to provide end users access to their account data in addition to developing new interfaces we continue to enhance our many existing interfaces in order to deliver more robust connectivity and increase operating efficiencies 

we continue to make substantial investments in research and development and we expect to focus our future research and development efforts on enhancing existing products and services and on developing new products and services that will offer increased ease of use be customized for specific customer categories be webintegrated or webbased and feature improved integration with other intuit and third party products and services and with our internal information systems we also expect to continue to focus significant research and development efforts on ongoing projects to update the technology platforms for several of our products our research and development expenses were 5662 million or 18 of total net revenue in fiscal 2009 6058 million or 20 of total net revenue in fiscal 2008 and 4725 million or 17 of total net revenue in fiscal 2007 

seasonality 

our quickbooks consumer tax and accounting professionals offerings are highly seasonal some of our other offerings are also seasonal but to a lesser extent revenue from our quickbooks software products tends to be highest during our second and third fiscal quarters sales of income tax preparation products and services are heavily concentrated in the period from november through april in our consumer tax business a greater proportion of our revenue has been occurring later in this seasonal period due in part to the growth in sales of turbotax online for which revenue is recognized upon printing or electronic filing of a tax return the seasonality of our consumer tax and accounting professionals revenue is also affected by the timing of the availability of tax forms from taxing agencies and the ability of those agencies to receive electronic tax return submissions delays in the availability of tax forms or the ability of taxing agencies to receive submissions can cause revenue to shift from our second fiscal quarter to our third fiscal quarter these seasonal patterns mean that our total net revenue is usually highest during our second quarter ending january 31 and third quarter ending april 30 we typically report losses in our first quarter ending october 31 and fourth quarter ending july 31 when revenue from our tax businesses is minimal while operating expenses continue at relatively consistent levels in addition the timing and composition of new customer offerings that include both product and service elements can materially shift revenue between quarters we believe the seasonality of our revenue is likely to continue in the future 

marketing sales and distribution channels 

markets 

our primary target customers are small and mediumsized businesses consumers accounting professionals and small and mediumsized financial institutions the markets in which we compete have always been characterized by rapid technological change shifting customer needs and frequent new product introductions and enhancements by competitors over the past several years the widespread availability of the internet has accelerated the pace of change and revolutionized the way that customers learn about and purchase products and services realtime personalized online shopping experiences are rapidly becoming the standard in addition many customers now begin their shopping process in one channel and ultimately make their purchase in a different channel this drives the need to create integrated multichannel shop and buy experiences market and industry changes are quickly rendering existing products and services obsolete so our success depends on our ability to respond rapidly to these changes with new business models updated competitive strategies new or enhanced products and services alternative distribution methods and other changes in the way we do business 

our target customers for online banking services are small and mediumsized financial institutions seeking an outsourced solution that allows them to compete with the larger national banks in their market we also provide online financial management solutions to financial institution customers of core processors 

marketing programs 

to sell our products and services to small and mediumsized businesses consumers and accounting professionals we use a variety of marketing programs to generate software orders stimulate demand and generally maintain and increase customer awareness of our products and services these programs include web marketing including purchasing key words from major search engine companies directresponse mail and email campaigns telephone solicitations newspaper magazine billboard radio and television advertising and promotional offers that we coordinate with major retailers we also use workflowintegrated inproduct discovery in some of our software products to market other related products and services including thirdparty products and services in our financial institutions business our marketing efforts are primarily focused on identifying potential financial institution clients and marketing our services to consumer and small business end users in cooperation with our financial institution clients 

sales and distribution channels 

multichannel shop and buy experiences our consumer and small and mediumsized business customers increasingly use the internet to research both online and desktop products and services some customers buy and use our products and services entirely online others purchase desktop products and services using the internet still others prefer to make their final decision at a retail location we coordinate our web sites promotions and retail displays in support of this integrated multichannel shop and buy model 

direct sales channel  we sell many of our products and services for small and mediumsized businesses consumers and accounting professionals directly to our customers through our web sites and call centers telesales continues to be an effective channel for serving customers that want live help selecting the products and services that are right for their needs 

in our financial institutions business we sell our products and services to financial institutions using a direct sales model and to a lesser but increasing extent in cooperation with core processing partners our typical sales cycle is approximately six to twelve months for new financial institutions and four to six months for addon sales to existing customers 

retail channel  we sell our quickbooks turbotax and quicken desktop software as well as our quickbooks payroll and intuit online payroll services and merchant credit card payment processing services at retail in the united states we sell these products and services directly and through distributors to office supply superstores warehouse clubs consumer electronics retailers general mass merchandisers online retailers and catalogers in canada and other international markets we also rely on distributors and other third parties who sell products into the 

retail channel the retail channel provides broad customer reach through retailersponsored advertising and exposure to retail foot traffic this channel also gives us the opportunity to communicate our product and service lineup and messages through multiple touch points and allows us to serve our customers at relatively modest cost 

other channels we have strategies to address the alliance partner solution provider and personal computer hardware manufacturer channels revenue from these channels is currently less significant than revenue from our direct and retail channels but it is growing we sell our consumer and small business products and services through selected alliance partners primarily banks credit unions and securities and investment firms these alliance partners help us reach new customers at the point of transaction and drive growth and market share by extending our online reach solution providers combine our products and services with valueadded marketing sales and technical expertise to deliver a complete solution at the local level relationships with selected personal computer hardware manufacturers help us attract new customers for our core software offerings 

in our financial institutions business we have joint marketing arrangements with several core processing vendors they include fiserv inc open solutions inc fidelity information services inc metavante corporation and computer services inc to deliver bill payment and bill presentment services to our financial institution customers we also maintain valueadded reseller relationships with major providers such as metavante corporation and checkfree corporation part of fiserv 

competition 

overview 

we face intense competition in all of our businesses both domestically and internationally competitive interest and expertise in many of the markets we serve particularly small business consumer tax and online banking have grown markedly over the past few years and we expect this trend to continue some of our existing competitors have significantly greater financial technical and marketing resources than we do in addition the competitive landscape can shift rapidly as new companies enter markets in which we compete this is particularly true for online products and services where the barriers to entry are lower than they are for desktop software products and services to attract customers many online competitors are offering free or lowpriced entrylevel products which we must take into account in our pricing strategies 

our most obvious competition comes from other companies that offer technology solutions similar to ours however for many of our products and services other important competitive alternatives for customers are third party service providers such as professional accountants and seasonal assisted tax preparation businesses manual tools and processes or generalpurpose software are also important competitive alternatives many of our new customers previously used pencil and paper or software such as word processors and spreadsheets rather than competitors’ software and services to perform financial tasks we believe that there is a longterm trend away from manual methods and toward the use of both desktop and online software to accomplish these tasks that will continue to provide growth opportunities 

competition specific to business segments 

small business group our quickbooks desktop product is the leading small business financial management software at retail our small business products and services face competitive challenges from companies such as netsuite inc and the sage group plc that offer software and associated services that directly target small business customers increasingly our small business products and services also face competition from free or low cost online accounting offerings as well as free online banking and bill payment services offered by financial institutions and others in our payroll business we compete directly with automatic data processing inc adp paychex and many other companies with payroll offerings in our merchant services business we also compete directly with large financial institutions such as wells fargo jp morgan chase and bank of america and with many independent sales organizations including first data corporation elavon global payments and fiscertegy 

consumer tax  in the private sector we face intense competition from hr block which provides assisted tax preparation services in its stores and a competing software offering called taxcut and from several other tax preparation service providers and online offerings including 2nd story software’s taxact these competing offerings subject us to significant price pressure 

we also face competitive challenges in our consumer tax business from publicly funded government entities that offer electronic tax preparation and filing services at no cost to individual taxpayers we are a member of the free file alliance a consortium of private sector companies that has entered into an agreement with the federal government under this agreement the member companies provide online federal tax preparation and filing services at no cost to eligible federal taxpayers and the federal government has agreed not to provide a competing service approximately 20 states have also adopted free file alliance publicprivate agreements while approximately 20 other states offer some form of direct government tax preparation and filing services free to qualified taxpayers we continue to actively work with others in the private and public sectors to advance the goals of the free file alliance policy initiative and to support successful publicprivate partnerships however future administrative regulatory or legislative activity in this area could harm our consumer tax business 

accounting professionals our proseries professional tax offerings face competition from cch’s atx and taxwise offerings our lacerte professional tax offerings face competition from competitivelypriced tax and accounting solutions that include integration with nontax functionality these include cch’s prosystems fx office suite and thomson reuters’ cs professional suite and gosystems tax we also face growing competition from online tax and accounting offerings which may be marketed more effectively or have lower pricing than our offerings for accounting professionals 

financial institutions the market for internet banking services is highly competitive in the area of consumer internet banking a number of companies offer outsourced online banking services to financial institutions including online resources s1 corporation and fundsxpress a subsidiary of first data corporation in addition several companies whose primary offerings are core processing or bill payment processing services also provide online banking services these companies include fiserv inc open solutions inc fidelity information services inc jack henry and metavante corporation in addition many of these firms offer our products through a referral or reseller arrangement with us we also compete for new customers with relatively recent entrants into the online financial management solutions market as we negotiate service contract renewals with current customers competitive pressures may require us to make concessions on pricing and other material terms to convince these customers to remain with us 

competitive factors 

we believe the most important competitive factors for our core software products — quickbooks turbotax lacerte proseries and quicken – are ease of use product features size of the installed customer base brand name recognition value proposition cost and product and support quality access to distribution channels is also important for our quickbooks turbotax and quicken products in addition support from accounting professionals and the ability for customers to upgrade within product families as their businesses grow are significant competitive factors for our quickbooks products productivity is also an important competitive factor for the fullservice accounting firms to which we market our lacerte products we believe we compete effectively on these factors as our quickbooks turbotax and quicken products are the leading products in the retail sales channel for their respective categories 

for our service offerings such as small business payroll merchant payment processing services and outsourced online banking features and ease of use the integration of these products with related software brand name recognition effective distribution quality of support cost and scalability of operations are important competitive factors 

customer service and technical support 

we provide customer service and technical support by telephone email online chat online communities and our customer service and technical support web sites we have fulltime and outsourced customer service and technical support staffs we supplement these staffs with seasonal employees and additional outsourcing during periods of peak call volumes such as during the tax return filing season or following a major product launch we outsource to several firms domestically and internationally most of our internationally outsourced consumer and small business customer service and technical support personnel are currently located in india and the philippines 

we offer free selfhelp information through our technical support web sites for our quickbooks turbotax accounting professionals and quicken software products customers use our web sites to find answers to commonly asked questions and check on the status of orders under certain support plans customers can also use our web sites to receive product updates electronically support alternatives and fees vary by product we also sponsor online user communities such as intuit community for small businesses and accounting professionals and turbotax live community where customers can share knowledge and product advice with each other 

manufacturing and distribution 

desktop software and supplies 

the main steps involved in manufacturing desktop software are manufacturing compact discs cds printing boxes and related materials and assembling and shipping the final products 

for retail manufacturing we have an agreement with arvato digital services inc adis a division of bertelsmann ag under which adis provides a majority of the manufacturing volume for our launches of quickbooks turbotax and quicken as well as for daytoday replenishment after product launches adis has operations in multiple locations that can provide redundancy if necessary we also have an agreement with jvc america inc under which jvc provides secondary outsourced manufacturing volume for these launches and for daytoday replenishment 

for retail distribution we have an agreement with adis under which adis handles all logistics services our retail product launches are operationally complex our model for product delivery for retail launches and replenishment is a hybrid of direct to store deliveries and shipments to central warehouse locations this allows improved inventory management by our retailers we also ship products for many of our smaller retail customers through distributors 

adis also provides most of the manufacturing volume and distribution services for our direct desktop software orders we have an exclusive agreement with harland clarke a division of mf worldwide corporation to fulfill orders for all of our printed checks and most other products for our financial supplies business 

we have multiple sources for all of our raw materials and availability has historically not been a significant problem for us 

prior to major product releases for our core desktop software products we tend to have significant levels of backlog but at other times backlog is minimal and we typically ship products within a few days of receiving an order because of this fluctuation in backlog we believe that backlog is not a reliable predictor of our future core desktop software sales 

internetbased products and services 

intuit’s data centers house most of the systems networks and databases required to operate and deliver our internetbased products and services these include quickbooks online online payroll services merchant payment processing services web site hosting services for small businesses turbotax online consumer and professional electronic tax filing services digital insight outsourced online banking services and quicken online through our data centers we connect customers to our products and services and store customer and business information as our businesses continue to move toward delivering more online products and services in conjunction with our connected services strategy our infrastructure will become even more critical in the future currently we have a number of data centers primarily located in the western united states over time we expect to transition to fewer data centers in more geographically diverse locations in fiscal 2008 and 2009 we built a new data center in washington state that we began occupying in the second half of fiscal 2009 we expect this data center to support the hosting and high availability requirements of many of our existing and future connected services offerings 

privacy and security of customer information and transactions 

we are subject to various federal state and international laws and regulations and to financial institution requirements relating to the privacy and security of customer and employee personal information we are also subject to laws and regulations that apply to the internet behavioral tracking telemarketing email activities and credit reporting additional laws in all of these areas are likely to be passed in the future which could result in significant limitations on or changes to the ways in which we can collect use store or transmit the personal information of our customers or employees communicate with our customers and deliver products and services or may significantly increase our compliance costs if our business expands to new industry segments and new uses of data that are regulated for privacy and security or to countries outside the united states that have strict data protections laws our compliance requirements and costs will increase 

through a master privacy policy framework designed to be consistent with globally recognized privacy principles we comply with united states federal and other country guidelines and practices to help ensure that customers and employees are aware of and can control how we use information about them our primary web sites such as quickbookscom and turbotaxcom have been certified by truste an independent organization that operates a web site privacy certification program representing industry standard practices to address users’ and regulators’ concerns about online privacy we also use privacy statements to provide notice to customers of our privacy practices as well as provide them the opportunity to furnish instructions with respect to use of their personal information we participate in industry groups whose purpose is to influence public policy and industry best practices for privacy and security 

to address security concerns we use security safeguards to help protect the systems and the information customers give to us from loss misuse and unauthorized alteration whenever customers transmit sensitive information such as a credit card number or tax return data to us through one of our web sites we use industry standards to encrypt the data as it is transmitted to us we work to protect our systems from unauthorized internal or external access using numerous commercially available computer security products as well as internally developed security procedures and practices 

government regulation 

the financial services industry is subject to extensive and complex federal and state regulation our financial institution customers which include commercial banks and credit unions operate in markets that are subject to rigorous regulatory oversight and supervision the compliance of our products and services with these requirements depends on a variety of factors including the particular functionality the interactive design and the charter or license of the financial institution our financial services customers must independently assess and determine what is required of them under these regulations and are responsible for ensuring that our systems and the design of their web sites conform to their regulatory obligations 

our digital insight subsidiary is not directly subject to federal or state regulations specifically applicable to financial institutions such as banks and credit unions however as a provider of services to financial institutions our digital insight subsidiary is examined by the federal financial institution examination council under the information technology examination guidelines although we believe we are not subject to direct supervision by federal and state banking agencies with regard to other regulations we have from time to time agreed to examinations of our business and operations by these agencies 

our consumer tax and accounting professionals businesses are also subject to federal and state government requirements including regulations related to the electronic filing of tax returns the provision of tax preparer assistance and the use and disclosure of customer information in addition we offer certain other products and services such as small business payroll which are subject to special regulatory requirements as we expand our financial institutions tax and small business products and services we may become subject to additional government regulation new laws or regulations may be adopted in these areas that could impose significant limitations on our business and increase our cost of compliance we continually analyze new business opportunities both domestically and internationally and new businesses that we pursue may require additional costs for regulatory compliance 

we are subject to federal and state laws and government regulations concerning employee safety and health and environmental matters the occupational safety and health administration the environmental protection agency and other federal and state agencies have the authority to put regulations in place that may have an impact on our operations 

intellectual property 

our success depends on our proprietary technology embodied in our offerings we protect this proprietary technology by relying on a variety of intellectual property mechanisms including copyright patent trade secret and trademark laws restrictions on disclosure and other methods for example we regularly file applications for patents copyrights and trademarks and service marks in order to protect intellectual property that we believe is important to our business we currently hold a small but growing patent portfolio we also have a number of registered trademarks that include intuit quickbooks turbotax lacerte proseries digital insight and quicken we have registered these and other trademarks and service marks in the united states and depending on the relevance of each brand to other markets in many foreign countries most registrations can be renewed perpetually at 10year intervals we also license intellectual property from third parties for use in our products 

although our portfolio of patents is growing the patents that have been issued to us could be determined to be invalid and may not be enforceable against competitive products in every jurisdiction in addition third parties have asserted and may in the future assert infringement claims against us these claims and any litigation may result in invalidation of our proprietary rights or a finding of infringement against us along with an assessment of damages litigation even if without merit could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention in addition third party licenses may not continue to be available to us on commercially acceptable terms or at all 

employees 

as of july 31 2009 we had approximately 7800 employees in major offices in the united states canada india the united kingdom and other locations we believe our future success and growth will depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees in all areas of our business we do not currently have any collective bargaining agreements with our employees and we believe employee relations are generally good although we have employmentrelated agreements with a number of key employees these agreements do not guarantee continued service we believe we offer competitive compensation and a good working environment we were named one of fortune magazine’s “100 best companies to work for” in each of the last eight years however we face intense competition for qualified employees and we expect to face continuing challenges in recruiting and retention

risk factors 

forwardlooking statements and risk factors 

this annual report on form 10k contains forwardlooking statements all statements in this report other than statements that are purely historical are forwardlooking statements words such as “expect” “anticipate” “intend” “plan” “believe” “forecast” “estimate” “seek” and similar expressions also identify forwardlooking statements in this report forwardlooking statements include without limitation the following



we caution investors that forwardlooking statements are only predictions based on our current expectations about future events and are not guarantees of future performance we encourage you to read carefully all information provided in this report and in our other filings with the sec before deciding to invest in our stock or to maintain or change your investment these forwardlooking statements are based on information as of the filing date of this annual report and we undertake no obligation to revise or update any forwardlooking statement for any reason

because forwardlooking statements involve risks and uncertainties there are important factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forwardlooking statements these factors include the following

we face intense competitive pressures that may harm our operating results 

we face intense competition in all of our businesses and we expect competition to remain intense in the future the number resources and sophistication of the companies with whom we compete have increased as we continue to expand our product and service offerings our competitors whether new or wellestablished may introduce superior products and services reduce prices gain better access to distribution

channels have greater technical marketing and other resources have greater name recognition have larger installed bases of customers have wellestablished relationships with our current and potential customers advertise aggressively or beat us to market with new products and services we also face intensified competition from providers of free online and desktop accounting tax banking and other financial services in order to compete we have also introduced free offerings in several categories but we may not be able to attract customers or effectively monetize all of these offerings and customers who have formerly paid for intuit’s products and services may elect to use free offerings instead these competitive factors may diminish our revenue and profitability and harm our ability to acquire and retain customers

our consumer tax business faces significant competition from both the public and private sector in the public sector we face the risk of federal and state taxing authorities developing software or other systems to facilitate tax return preparation and electronic filing at no charge to taxpayers these or similar programs may be introduced or expanded in the future which may cause us to lose customers and revenue although the free file alliance has kept the federal government from being a direct competitor to intuit’s tax offerings it has fostered additional online competition and may cause us to lose significant revenue opportunities in addition taxpayers who formerly have paid for intuit’s products may elect to use intuit’s or our competitors’ free federal service instead the current agreement with the free file alliance is scheduled to expire in october 2009 although we are in negotiations with the irs and other members of the free file alliance to renew this agreement there is no guarantee an agreement will be reached prior to its termination if the irs chose not to renew this agreement or terminated the agreement and elected to provide government software and electronic filing services to taxpayers at no charge or if the federal government significantly altered the free file alliance or required the provision of government tax filing services directly to taxpayers our revenue and profits may suffer see the discussion on the free file alliance in item 1 “business — competition” we anticipate that governmental encroachment may present a continued competitive threat to our business for the foreseeable future

future revenue growth depends upon our ability to adapt to technological change and successfully introduce new and enhanced products and services 

the software as a service saas and desktop software industries are characterized by rapidly changing technology evolving industry standards and frequent new product introductions as we continue to grow our saas and other offerings we must continue to innovate and develop new products and features to meet changing customer needs and attract and retain talented software developers we need to continue to develop our skills tools and capabilities to capitalize on existing and emerging technologies we are currently in the process of updating the software platforms related to a number of our offerings if we experience prolonged delays or unforeseen difficulties in upgrading our systems and architecture we may not be able to develop new offerings and enhancements that we need to remain competitive

a number of our businesses also derive a significant amount of their revenue from onetime upfront license fees and rely on customer upgrades and service offerings to generate a significant portion of their revenues in addition our consumer and professional tax businesses depend significantly on revenue from customers who return each year to use our updated tax preparation and filing software and services as our existing products mature encouraging customers to purchase product upgrades becomes more challenging unless new product releases provide features and functionality that have meaningful incremental value if we are not able to develop and clearly demonstrate the value of new or upgraded products or services to our customers our revenues may be harmed

in some cases we may expend a significant amount of resources and management attention on products or services that do not ultimately succeed in their markets we have encountered difficulty in launching new products and services in the past if we misjudge customer needs in the future our new products and services may not succeed and our revenues and earnings may be harmed

as our product and service offerings become more complex our revenue streams may become less predictable  

our expanding range of products and services including services delivered online generates more varied revenue streams than our traditional desktop software businesses and the accounting policies that apply to revenue from our newer offerings are complex for example as we offer online services bundled with other products we may be required to defer a higher percentage of our product revenue into future fiscal periods in addition as we offer more services on a subscription basis we recognize revenue from those services over the periods in which the services are provided this may result in significant shifts of revenue from quarter to quarter or from one fiscal year to the next and may make our revenues less predictable 

business interruption or failure of our information technology and communication systems may impair the availability of our products and services which may damage our reputation and harm our future financial results 

as we continue to grow our online services we become more dependent on the continuing operation and availability of our information technology and communication systems and those of our external service providers any damage to or failure of our systems may result in interruptions in our service which may reduce our revenues and profits cause us to lose customers and damage our brand in particular any prolonged interruptions in our online tax preparation or electronic filing services or in any electronic filing systems operating by the government at any time during the tax season may result in lost customers additional refunds of customer charges negative publicity and increased operating costs any of which may significantly harm our business financial condition and results of operations although we have implemented practices designed to maintain the availability of our online products and services and mitigate the harm of any unplanned interruptions we do not have complete redundancy for all of our systems and our disaster recovery planning may not account for all eventualities despite our efforts to maintain continuous and reliable server operations we occasionally experience unplanned outages or technical difficulties due to our evolving business needs in fiscal 2008 and 2009 we built a new data center in washington state to support our longer term hosting requirements we began occupying this data center in the second half of fiscal 2009 if we do not execute the transition to the new data center in an effective manner we may experience unplanned service disruptions or unforeseen increases in cost which may harm our operating results and our business we do not maintain realtime backup of all our data and in the event of significant system disruption particularly during peak tax filing season we may experience loss of data or processing capabilities which may cause us to lose customers and may materially harm our reputation and our operating results 

our business operations data centers information technology and communications systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters malicious attacks fire power loss telecommunications failures computer viruses computer denial of service attacks terrorist attacks and other events beyond our control the majority of our research and development activities our corporate headquarters our principal information technology systems and other critical business operations are located near major seismic faults we do not carry earthquake insurance for direct quakerelated losses our future financial results may be materially harmed in the event of a major earthquake or other natural or manmade disaster 

we rely on internal systems and external systems maintained by manufacturers distributors and service providers to take and fulfill customer orders handle customer service requests and host certain online activities any interruption or failure of our internal or external systems may prevent us or our service providers from accepting and fulfilling customer orders or cause company and customer data to be unintentionally disclosed our continuing efforts to upgrade and expand our network security and other information systems may be costly and problems with the design or implementation of system enhancements may harm our business and our results of operations 

the recent global economic downturn may harm our business and financial condition 

the recent global economic downturn has caused disruptions and extreme volatility in global financial markets and increased rates of default and bankruptcy and has impacted consumer and small business spending these macroeconomic developments may continue to negatively affect our business and financial condition many customers may delay or reduce technology purchases this may result in reductions in sales of our products slower adoption of new technologies and upgrades to existing technologies and increased price competition decreased consumer spending levels may also reduce credit and debit card transaction processing volumes causing reductions 

in our payments revenue weakness in the enduser market may negatively affect the cash flow of our distributors and resellers who may in turn delay paying their obligations to us which may increase our credit risk exposure and cause delays in our recognition of revenue or future sales to these customers if economic or other factors cause financial institutions to fail or macroeconomic factors affecting banks credit unions mortgage lenders and other financial institutions lead to costcutting efforts we may lose current or potential customers or achieve less revenue per customer and our revenues may suffer continued consolidation of the banking and financial services industry whether due to failures of financial institutions or other factors may result in a smaller market for our products and services and may cause us to lose relationships with key customers any of these events may likely harm our business and our future financial results 

the nature of our products necessitates timely product launches and if we experience significant product quality problems or delays it may harm our revenue earnings and reputation 

all of our tax products and many of our nontax products have rigid development timetables that increase the risk of errors in our products and the risk of launch delays our tax preparation software product development cycle is particularly challenging due to the need to incorporate unpredictable tax law and tax form changes each year and because our customers expect high levels of accuracy and a timely launch of these products to prepare and file their taxes by the tax filing deadline due to the complexity of our products and the condensed development cycles under which we operate our products sometimes contain “bugs” that may unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the software when we encounter problems we may be required to modify our code distribute patches to customers who have already purchased the product and recall or repackage existing product inventory in our distribution channels if we encounter development challenges or discover errors in our products late in our development cycle it may cause us to delay our product launch date any major defects or launch delays may lead to loss of customers and revenue negative publicity customer and employee dissatisfaction reduced retailer shelf space and promotions and increased operating expenses such as inventory replacement costs legal fees or payments resulting from our commitment to reimburse penalties and interest paid by customers due solely to calculation errors in our consumer tax preparation products 

our hosting collection use and retention of personal customer information create risk that may harm our business 

a number of our businesses collect use and retain large amounts of personal customer information including credit card numbers tax return information bank account numbers and passwords personal and business financial data social security numbers and other payroll information we may also develop new business models that use personal information or data derived from personal information in innovative and novel ways in addition we collect and maintain personal information of our employees in the ordinary course of our business some of this personal customer and employee information is held and some transactions are executed by third parties in addition as many of our products and services are web based the amount of data we store for our users on our servers including personal information has been increasing we and our vendors use commercially available security technologies to protect transactions and personal information we use security and business controls to limit access and use of personal information however a third party may be able to circumvent these security and business measures and errors in the storage use or transmission of personal information may result in a breach of customer or employee privacy or theft of assets which may require notification under applicable data privacy regulations we employ contractors temporary and seasonal employees who may have access to the personal information of customers and employees or who may execute transactions in the normal course of their duties while we conduct necessary and appropriate background checks of these individuals and limit access to systems and data it is possible that one or more of these individuals may circumvent these controls resulting in a security breach 

the ability to execute transactions and the possession and use of personal information in conducting our business subjects us to legislative and regulatory burdens that may require notification to customers or employees of a security breach restrict our use of personal information and hinder our ability to acquire new customers or market to existing customers as our business continues to expand to new industry segments that may be more highly regulated for privacy and data security and to countries outside the us that have more strict data protection laws our compliance requirements and costs may increase we have incurred — and may continue to incur  significant expenses to comply with mandatory privacy and security standards and protocols imposed by law regulation industry standards or contractual obligations 

in the past we have experienced lawsuits and negative publicity relating to privacy issues and we may face similar suits in the future a major breach of our security measures or those of third parties that execute transactions or hold and manage personal information may have serious negative consequences for our businesses including possible fines penalties and damages reduced customer demand for our services harm to our reputation and brands further regulation and oversight by federal or state agencies and loss of our ability to provide financial transaction services or accept and process customer credit card orders or tax returns from time to time we detect or receive notices from customers or public or private agencies that they have detected vulnerabilities in our servers our software or thirdparty software components that are distributed with our products the existence of vulnerabilities even if they do not result in a security breach may harm customer confidence and require substantial resources to address and we may not be able to discover or remediate such security vulnerabilities before they are exploited if hackers were able to circumvent our security measures we may lose personal information although we have sophisticated network and application security internal control measures and physical security procedures to safeguard our systems there can be no assurance that a security breach loss or theft of personal information will not occur which may harm our business customer reputation and future financial results and may require us to expend significant resources to address these problems including notification under data privacy regulations 

our reliance on a limited number of manufacturing and distribution suppliers may harm our business 

we have chosen to outsource the majority of the manufacturing and distribution for many of our desktop software products to a single third party provider and we use a single vendor to produce and distribute our check and business forms supplies products although our reliance on single suppliers provides us with efficiencies and enhanced bargaining power poor performance by these suppliers may significantly harm our business this risk is amplified by the fact that we carry very little inventory and rely on justintime manufacturing processes in particular the loss of our manufacturing partner for retail may be disruptive to our business and may cause delay in a product launch we seek to mitigate this risk by managing our second tier vendors and maintaining contingency plans if we experience delays during a peak demand period or significant quality issues our business may be significantly harmed 

our revenue and earnings are highly seasonal and our quarterly results fluctuate significantly 

several of our businesses are highly seasonal causing significant quarterly fluctuations in our financial results revenue and operating results are usually strongest during the second and third fiscal quarters ending january 31 and april 30 due to our tax businesses contributing most of their revenue during those quarters and the timing of the release of our small business software products and upgrades we experience lower revenues and significant operating losses in the first and fourth quarters ending october 31 and july 31 our financial results may also fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year due to a variety of factors including changes in product sales mix that affect average selling prices product release dates the timing of delivery of federal and state tax forms the timing of our discontinuance of support for older product offerings changes to our bundling strategy such as the inclusion of upgrades with certain offerings changes to how we communicate the availability of new functionality in the future any of which may impact the pattern of revenue recognition and the timing of acquisitions divestitures and goodwill and purchased intangible asset impairment charges 

if we are unable to develop and maintain critical third party business relationships the business may be adversely affected 

our growth is dependent on the strength of our business relationships and our ability to continue to develop and maintain new relationships we rely on various business partners including third party service providers vendors licensing partners development partners and licensees among others in many areas of our business the failure of these third parties to provide adequate services and technologies or the failure of the third parties to adequately maintain or update their services and technologies could result in a disruption to our business operations alternative arrangements and services may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or we may experience business interruptions upon a transition to an alternative partner or vendor 

in the financial institutions business we rely on core processors and other third parties to enable our online banking and bill pay services consolidation among core processors or between core processors and online banking and billpay providers may create larger or verticallyintegrated competitors that may have stronger relationships with our current or potential financial institutions clients if these core processors fail to support any of the functionality in 

our products and services or significantly raise their prices we may lose customers and our financial results may suffer

because we depend on a small number of larger retailers and distributors changes in these relationships may harm our business 

we sell most of our desktop software products through our retail distribution channel and a relatively small number of larger retailers and distributors generate a significant portion of our sales volume our principal retailers have significant bargaining leverage due to their size and available resources historically some retailers have elected to offer our tax products exclusively but we cannot guarantee that these exclusive relationships will continue in the future any change in principal business terms loss of exclusivity major disruption or termination of a relationship with these resellers including due to bankruptcy of the resellers may result in a significant decline in our revenues and earnings the sourcing decisions product display locations and promotional activities that retailers undertake may greatly impact the sales of our products changes in our pricing product offerings or features or concerns by retailers about our direct sales efforts may cause retailers or distributors to reduce their efforts to promote our products eliminate any exclusive placements or stop selling our products altogether if any of our retailers or distributors experience financial difficulties we may be unable to collect amounts that we are owed at january 31 2009 in the midst of the 2008 consumer tax season amounts due from our 10 largest retailers and distributors represented approximately 51 of total gross accounts receivable

increased government regulation of our businesses may harm our operating results 

the tax preparation industry continues to receive heightened attention from federal and state governments new legislation regulation public policy considerations or litigation by the government or private entities may result in greater oversight of the tax preparation industry restrict the types of products and services that we can offer or the prices we can charge or otherwise cause us to change the way we operate our tax businesses or offer our tax products and services this in turn may increase our cost of doing business and limit our revenue opportunities

we are also required to comply with a variety of state revenue agency standards in order to successfully operate our tax preparation and electronic filing services changes in stateimposed requirements by one or more of the states including the required use of specific technologies or technology standards may significantly increase the costs of providing those services to our customers and may prevent us from delivering a quality product to our customers in a timely manner

our financial institutions business provides services to banks credit unions and other institutions that are subject to extensive and complex federal and state regulation as a result our financial institution customers require that our products and services comply with the regulations applicable to these customers if we are unable to comply with these regulations we may incur significant costs and penalties face litigation or governmental proceedings and lose our ability to sell to these customers any of these adverse events may harm our future financial results and our reputation

in addition as we seek to grow our business we may expand into more highlyregulated businesses or countries which may require increased investment in compliance and auditing functions or new technologies in order to meet regulatory standards government authorities may enact other laws rules or regulations that place new burdens or restrictions on our business or determine that our operations are directly subject to existing rules or regulations such as requirements related to data collection use transmission retention and processing which may make our business more costly less efficient or impossible to conduct and may require us to modify our current or future products or services which may harm our future financial results

expansion of our operations in international markets exposes us to operational and compliance risks 

as we continue to grow our business internationally we face increased risk which may harm our business and financial condition we have limited experience with operations outside the us and our ability to manage our business and conduct our operations internationally requires management attention and resources and is subject to a number of risks including difficulties in managing varying foreign operations political or social unrest or economic instability foreign currency restrictions and exchange rate fluctuations higher costs associated with doing business internationally and potentially adverse tax consequences also compliance with complex foreign and us laws and

regulations that apply to our international operations increases our cost of doing business in international jurisdictions and may expose us or our employees to fines and penalties 

if we encounter problems with our thirdparty customer service and technical support providers our business and future financial results may be harmed 

we outsource a substantial portion of our customer service and technical support activities to domestic and international thirdparty service providers including service providers in india and the philippines and we expect to continue to rely heavily on third parties in the future this strategy provides us with lower operating costs and greater flexibility but also presents risks to our business including the following 

 

we are exposed to risks associated with credit card and payment fraud and with credit card processing 

in our payments processing service business if merchants for whom we process payment transactions are unable to pay refunds due to their customers in connection with disputed or fraudulent merchant transactions we may be required to pay those amounts and our payments may exceed the amount of the customer reserves we have established to make such payments 

we are subject to payment card association operating rules and certification requirements as in effect from time to time failure to comply with these rules or requirements may subject us to fines and higher transaction fees or cause us to lose our ability to accept credit card payments from our customers resulting in harm to our business and future financial results 

if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights competitors may exploit our innovations which may weaken our competitive position and reduce our revenue and earnings 

our success depends upon our proprietary technology embodied in our offerings we protect this proprietary technology by relying on a combination of copyright trade secret trademark patent confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements although we seek to obtain patent protection for our innovations it is possible we may not be able to protect some of those innovations given the cost of obtaining patent protection we may choose not to patent certain innovations that later turn out to be important there is also the possibility that despite our efforts the scope of protection may be insufficient or that an issued patent may be deemed invalid or unenforceable it is possible that other companies may successfully challenge the validity or scope of our patents and that our patent portfolio which is relatively small may not provide us with adequate protection ultimately our attempts to secure legal protection for our proprietary rights may not be adequate and our competitors may independently develop similar technologies duplicate our products or design around patents and other intellectual property rights if our intellectual property protection proves inadequate we may lose our competitive advantage and our future financial results may suffer 

third parties claiming that we infringe their proprietary rights may cause us to incur significant legal expenses and prevent us from selling our products 

as the number of products in the software industry increases and the functionality of these products further overlap and as we acquire technology through acquisitions or licenses we may become increasingly subject to infringement 

claims including patent copyright and trademark infringement claims litigation may be necessary to determine the validity and scope of the patent rights of others we have received allegations of patent infringement claims in the past and may receive more claims in the future based on allegations that our products infringe upon patents held by third parties some of these claims are the subject of pending litigation against us and against some of our oem customers these claims may involve patent holding companies or other adverse patent owners who have no relevant product revenues of their own and against whom our own patents may provide little or no deterrence the ultimate outcome of any allegation is uncertain and regardless of outcome any such claim with or without merit may be time consuming to defend result in costly litigation divert management’s time and attention from our business require us to stop selling delay shipping or redesign our products or require us to pay monetary damages for royalty or licensing fees or to satisfy indemnification obligations that we have with some of our customers our failure to obtain necessary license or other rights or litigation arising out of intellectual property claims may harm our business

we expect copying and misuse of our intellectual property to be a persistent problem which may cause lost revenue and increased expenses 

policing unauthorized use and copying of our products is difficult expensive and time consuming current us laws that prohibit copying give us only limited practical protection from software piracy and the laws of many other countries provide very little protection we frequently encounter unauthorized copies of our software being sold through online marketplaces in addition efforts to protect our intellectual property may be misunderstood and perceived negatively by our customers although we continue to evaluate and put in place technology solutions to attempt to lessen the impact of piracy and engage in efforts to educate consumers and public policy leaders on these issues and cooperate with industry groups in their efforts to combat piracy we expect piracy to be a persistent problem that results in lost revenues and increased expenses

our use of third party intellectual property in our products and services may harm our business 

many of our products and services include intellectual property of third parties which we license under agreements that must be renewed or renegotiated from time to time we may not be able to obtain licenses to these third party technologies or content on reasonable terms or at all if we are unable to obtain the rights necessary to use this intellectual property in our products and services we may not be able to sell the affected products which may in turn harm our future financial results

some of our offerings include thirdparty software that is licensed under socalled “open source” licenses some of which may include a requirement that under certain circumstances we make available or grant licenses to any modifications or derivative works we create based upon the open source software although we have established internal review and approval processes to mitigate these risks we may not be sure that all open source software is submitted for approval prior to use in our products many of the risks associated with usage of open source may not be eliminated and may if not properly addressed harm our business

our acquisition and divestiture activities may disrupt our ongoing business may involve increased expenses and may present risks not contemplated at the time of the transactions 

we have acquired and may continue to acquire companies products and technologies that complement our strategic direction acquisitions involve significant risks and uncertainties including



 

acquisitions and divestitures are inherently risky our transactions may not be successful and may in some cases harm our operating results or financial condition if we use debt to fund acquisitions or for other purposes our interest expense and leverage may increase significantly if we issue equity securities as consideration in an acquisition current shareholders’ percentage ownership and earnings per share may be diluted 

we have issued 1 billion in a debt offering and may incur other debt in the future which may adversely affect our financial condition and future financial results 

in fiscal 2007 we issued 1 billion in senior unsecured notes we have also entered into a 500 million fiveyear revolving credit facility although we have no current plans to request any advances under this credit facility we may use the proceeds of any future borrowing for general corporate purposes or for future acquisitions or expansion of our business 

this debt may adversely affect our financial condition and future financial results by among other things 

 

our current revolving credit facility imposes restrictions on us including restrictions on our ability to create liens on our assets and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur indebtedness and require us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios our ability to comply with these ratios may be affected by events beyond our control in addition our longterm nonconvertible debt includes covenants that may adversely affect our ability to incur certain liens or engage in certain types of sale and leaseback transactions if we breach any of the covenants under our longterm debt or our revolving credit facility and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders then subject to applicable cure periods any outstanding indebtedness may be declared immediately due and payable 

in addition changes by any rating agency to our credit rating may negatively impact the value and liquidity of both our debt and equity securities if our credit ratings are downgraded or other negative action is taken the interest rate payable by us under our revolving credit facility may increase in addition any downgrades in our credit ratings may affect our ability to obtain additional financing in the future and may affect the terms of any such financing 

we are subject to risks associated with information disseminated through our services 

the law relating to the liability of online services companies for information carried on or disseminated through their services is often unsettled claims may be made against online services companies under both us and foreign law for defamation libel invasion of privacy negligence copyright or trademark infringement or other theories based on the nature and content of the materials disseminated through their services certain of our services include content generated by users although this content is not generated by us claims of defamation or other injury may be made against us for that content any costs incurred as a result of this potential liability may harm our business 

if actual product returns exceed returns reserves our future financial results may be harmed 

we ship more desktop software products to our distributors and retailers than we expect them to sell in order to reduce the risk that distributors or retailers may run out of products this is particularly true for our consumer tax products which have a short selling season and for which returns occur primarily in our fiscal third and fourth quarters like many software companies that sell their products through distributors and retailers we have historically accepted significant product returns we establish reserves against revenue for product returns in our financial statements based on estimated returns and we closely monitor product sales and inventory in the retail channel in an effort to maintain adequate reserves in the past returns have not differed significantly from these reserves however if we experience actual returns that significantly exceed reserves it may result in lower net revenue 

acquisitionrelated costs and impairment charges may cause significant fluctuation in our net income 

our acquisitions have resulted in significant expenses including amortization and impairment of purchased intangible assets charges for inprocess research and development and impairment of goodwill total acquisitionrelated costs in these categories were approximately 103 million in fiscal 2009 92 million in fiscal 2008 and 51 million in fiscal 2007 although under current accounting rules goodwill is not amortized we may incur impairment charges related to the goodwill already recorded and to goodwill arising out of future acquisitions we test the impairment of goodwill annually in our fourth fiscal quarter or more frequently if indicators of impairment arise the timing of the formal annual test may result in charges to our statement of operations in our fourth fiscal quarter that may not have been reasonably foreseen in prior periods at july 31 2009 we had 18 billion in goodwill and 2930 million in net purchased intangible assets on our balance sheet both of which may be subject to impairment charges in the future new acquisitions and any impairment of the value of purchased assets may have a significant negative impact on our future financial results

our investments in auction rate securities are subject to risks that may cause losses and affect the liquidity of these investments 

at july 31 2009 we held a total of 2445 million in municipal auction rate securities that we valued at par we classified 1509 million of these securities as shortterm investments and 936 million of these securities as longterm investments on our balance sheet at that date due to a decrease in liquidity in the global credit markets in february 2008 auctions began failing for the municipal auction rate securities we held regularly scheduled auctions for these securities have generally continued to fail since that time we will not be able to liquidate these investments and realize their full carrying value unless successful auctions occur a buyer is found outside of the auction process the issuer calls the security the issuer repays principal over time from cash flows prior to final maturity or the security matures according to contractual terms ranging from one to 38 years we believe the fair values of the municipal auction rate securities we hold are approximately equal to their par values however if the issuers of these securities are unable to call the securities or successfully close future auctions and their credit ratings are lowered we may be required to record future impairment charges related to these investments which would harm our results of operations if we are unable to find alternate means to liquidate these investments we may not realize the value of the investments until the final maturity of the underlying securities

in november 2008 we accepted an offer from ubs ag ubs one of the brokerdealers of our municipal auction rate securities that gives us the option to sell to ubs a total of 1409 million in municipal auction rate securities at par value at any time during a twoyear period beginning june 30 2010 the offer also gives ubs the discretion to buy any or all of these municipal auction rate securities from us at par value at any time to date ubs has not purchased any of these securities from us even with this option we may not realize the value of these investments until after june 30 2010 we continue to have counterparty risk associated with ubs

if we fail to process transactions effectively our revenue and earnings may be harmed 

our operations process a significant volume and dollar value of transactions on a daily basis especially in our payroll and payments businesses due to the size and volume of transactions that we handle effective processing systems and controls are essential to ensure that transactions are handled appropriately despite our efforts it is possible that we may make errors or that funds may be misappropriated due to fraud involving our offerings in addition to any direct damages and fines that any such problems may create which may be substantial the loss of customer confidence in our accuracy and controls may seriously harm our business the systems supporting our business are comprised of multiple technology platforms that are difficult to scale if we are unable to effectively manage our systems and processes we may be unable to process customer data in an accurate reliable and timely manner which may harm our business

because competition for our key employees is intense we may not be able to attract and retain the highly skilled employees we need to support our planned growth 

much of our future success depends on the continued service and availability of skilled personnel including members of our executive team and those in technical marketing and staff positions experienced personnel in the software and services industries are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense especially in

california where the majority of our employees are located although we strive to be an employer of choice we may not be able to continue to successfully attract and retain key personnel which may cause our business to suffer 

we are frequently a party to litigation that is costly to defend and consumes the time of our management 

we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen out of the ordinary conduct of our business and are not yet resolved and additional claims may arise in the future results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty defending litigation consumes the time of our management and is expensive for intuit even though we often seek insurance coverage for litigation defense costs there is no assurance that our defense costs which may be substantial will be covered in all cases in addition by its nature litigation is unpredictable and we may not prevail even in cases where we strongly believe a plaintiff’s case has no valid claims if we do not prevail in litigation we may be required to pay substantial monetary damages or alter our business operations regardless of the outcome litigation is expensive and consumes the time of our management and may ultimately harm our future financial results 

unanticipated changes in our tax rates may affect our future financial results 

our future effective tax rates may be favorably or unfavorably affected by unanticipated changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or by changes in tax laws or their interpretation in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes there may be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on our future financial results 

our business depends on our strong reputation and the value of our brands 

developing and maintaining awareness of our brands is critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our existing and future products and services and is an important element in attracting new customers we believe that brand recognition will increase as competition in our markets develops adverse publicity whether or not justified relating to activities by our employees or agents may tarnish our reputation and reduce the value of our brands damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity may reduce demand for our products and services and thus have an adverse effect on our future financial results as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of the brands

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda includes the following sections 

 

 

 

 

you should note that this mda discussion contains forwardlooking statements that involve risks and uncertainties please see the section entitled “forwardlooking statements and risk factors” at the beginning of item 1a for important information to consider when evaluating such statements 

you should read this mda in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes in item 8 in february 2007 we completed the acquisition of digital insight corporation for a total purchase price of approximately 134 billion in december 2007 we acquired homestead technologies inc for total consideration of approximately 170 million and in february 2008 we acquired electronic clearing house inc echo for a total purchase price of approximately 131 million in july 2009 we acquired paycycle inc for a total purchase price of approximately 169 million accordingly we have included the results of operations for these companies in our consolidated results of operations from their respective dates of acquisition during fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2008 we transitioned certain outsourced payroll customers in connection with a sale of assets to automatic data processing inc adp we have also reclassified our financial statements for all periods presented to reflect our intuit distribution management solutions business as discontinued operations see “results of operations — dispositions and discontinued operations” later in this item 7 for more information unless otherwise noted the following discussion pertains only to our continuing operations 

in fiscal 2009 we reclassified segment results for all periods presented to reflect the continued evolution of our business we no longer combine results for our payroll business with results for our payments business because management currently views these businesses separately we also changed the name of our quickbooks segment to financial management solutions our new payroll segment to employee management solutions and our new payments segment to payments solutions we transferred revenue for our point of sale offerings from our financial management solutions segment to our payments solutions segment to align this product group more closely with the customers they serve total point of sale revenue was less than 40 million for all periods presented we also reclassified certain retail sales expenses from common expenses to segment income or loss consistent with how management now views these expenses these expenses were less than 25 million for all periods presented 

executive overview 

this overview provides a high level discussion of our operating results and some of the trends that affect our business we believe that an understanding of these trends is important in order to understand our financial results for fiscal 2009 as well as our future prospects this summary is not intended to be exhaustive nor is it intended to be a substitute for the detailed discussion and analysis provided elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

overview of financial results 

total net revenue for fiscal 2009 was 32 billion an increase of 4 compared with fiscal 2008 the fiscal 2009 revenue increase was due to revenue growth in our consumer tax payments solutions employee management solutions accounting professionals and financial institutions segments partially offset by revenue decreases in our other businesses and financial management solutions segments consumer tax revenue increased 670 million or 7 due to growth in turbotax online units which more than offset a decrease in turbotax desktop units 

operating income from continuing operations of 6821 million for fiscal 2009 increased 313 million or 5 compared with fiscal 2008 fiscal 2009 revenue grew 1115 million and total costs and expenses increased 802 million total costs and expenses for fiscal 2009 increased due to our fiscal 2008 acquisitions of homestead and echo higher advertising and other marketing expenses to support the launch and subsequent promotion of turbotax and quickbooks 2009 higher depreciation expense for investments in our infrastructure higher sharebased compensation expense and a charge for the historical use of certain technology licensing rights decreases in total costs and expenses due to lower performance incentive payouts as well as other compensation and benefit savings due to lower staffing and lower severance charges partially offset these increases

net income from continuing operations of 4470 million for fiscal 2009 decreased 38 million or 1 compared with fiscal 2008 in fiscal 2008 we recorded a pretax gain of 516 million on the sale of certain outsourced payroll assets there was no comparable transaction in fiscal 2009 in addition interest income decreased in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008 due to the impact of lower interest rates that more than offset the impact of higher invested balances

due to the foregoing factors diluted net income per share from continuing operations of 135 in fiscal 2009 increased 2 compared with 133 in fiscal 2008

in july 2009 we acquired paycycle inc for a total purchase price of approximately 169 million paycycle is a provider of online payroll services to small businesses and became part of our employee management solutions segment

we ended fiscal 2009 with cash cash equivalents and investments totaling 13 billion an increase of 5192 million from july 31 2008 cash cash equivalents and investments at july 31 2009 included 1509 in municipal auction rate securities we did not classify any of the municipal auction rate securities we held at july 31 2008 as cash cash equivalents and investments at july 31 2009 and 2008 we also held 936 million and 2853 million in municipal auction rate securities that we classified as longterm investments on our balance sheet see “liquidity and capital resources — auction rate securities” later in this item 7 for more information in fiscal 2009 we generated 8124 million in cash from continuing operations and 1836 million from the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans during the same period we used 3002 million in cash for the repurchase of shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs 1825 million for capital expenditures and 1874 million for acquisitions of businesses primarily paycycle and intangible assets at july 31 2009 we had authorization from our board of directors to expend up to an additional 2998 million for stock repurchases through may 15 2011

on september 11 2009 we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire mint software inc a provider of online personal finance management services the cash transaction is valued at approximately 170 million including the assumption of mint outstanding stock options mint will become part of our other businesses segment the transaction is subject to regulatory approval and customary closing conditions we expect the transaction to close before the end of calendar 2009

seasonality 

our quickbooks consumer tax and accounting professionals offerings are highly seasonal some of our other offerings are also seasonal but to a lesser extent revenue from our quickbooks software products tends to be highest during our second and third fiscal quarters sales of income tax preparation products and services are heavily concentrated in the period from november through april in our consumer tax business a greater proportion of our revenue has been occurring later in this seasonal period due in part to the growth in sales of turbotax online for which revenue is recognized upon printing or electronic filing of a tax return the seasonality of our consumer tax and accounting professionals revenue is also affected by the timing of the availability of tax forms from taxing agencies and the ability of those agencies to receive electronic tax return submissions delays in the availability of tax forms or the ability of taxing agencies to receive submissions can cause revenue to shift from our second fiscal quarter to our third fiscal quarter these seasonal patterns mean that our total net revenue is usually highest during our second quarter ending january 31 and third quarter ending april 30 we typically report losses in our first quarter ending october 31 and fourth quarter ending july 31 when revenue from our tax businesses is minimal while operating expenses continue at relatively consistent levels in addition the timing and composition of new

customer offerings that include both product and service elements can materially shift revenue between quarters we believe the seasonality of our revenue is likely to continue in the future 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

in preparing our financial statements we make estimates assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on our net revenue operating income or loss and net income or loss as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our balance sheet we believe that the estimates assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies senior management has reviewed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and their disclosure in this annual report on form 10k with the audit committee of our board of directors 

revenue recognition 

we derive revenue from the sale of packaged software products license fees software subscriptions product support hosting services payroll services merchant services professional services transaction fees and multiple element arrangements that may include any combination of these items we follow the appropriate revenue recognition rules for each type of revenue for additional information see “revenue recognition” in note 1 to the financial statements in item 8 we generally recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists we have delivered the product or performed the service the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable however determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report for example for multiple element arrangements we must make assumptions and judgments in order to allocate the total price among the various elements we must deliver to determine whether undelivered services are essential to the functionality of the delivered products and services to determine whether vendorspecific evidence of fair value exists for each undelivered element and to determine whether and when each element has been delivered if we were to change any of these assumptions or judgments it could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period amounts for fees collected or invoiced and due relating to arrangements where revenue cannot be recognized are reflected on our balance sheet as deferred revenue and recognized when the applicable revenue recognition criteria are satisfied 

in connection with the sale of certain products we provide a limited amount of free technical support assistance to customers we do not defer the recognition of any revenue associated with sales of these products since the cost of providing this free technical support is insignificant the technical support is generally provided within one year after the associated revenue is recognized and free product enhancements are minimal and infrequent we accrue the estimated cost of providing this free support upon product shipment 

return and rebate reserves 

as part of our revenue recognition policy we estimate future product returns and rebate payments and establish reserves against revenue at the time of sale based on these estimates our return policy allows distributors and retailers subject to contractual limitations to return purchased products product returns by distributors and retailers relate primarily to the return of excess and obsolete products in determining our product returns reserves we consider the volume and price mix of products in the retail channel historical return rates for prior releases of the product trends in retailer inventory and economic trends that might impact customer demand for our products including the competitive environment and the timing of new releases of our products we fully reserve for excess and obsolete products in the distribution channels 

our rebate reserves include distributor and retailer sales incentive rebates and enduser rebates our estimated reserves for distributor and retailer incentive rebates are based on distributors’ and retailers’ actual performance against the terms and conditions of rebate programs which we typically establish annually our reserves for enduser rebates are estimated based on the terms and conditions of the specific promotional rebate program actual sales during the promotion and historical redemption trends by product and by type of promotional program 

in the past actual returns and rebates have not differed significantly from the reserves that we have established however actual returns and rebates in any future period are inherently uncertain if we were to change our 

assumptions and estimates our revenue reserves would change which would impact the net revenue we report if actual returns and rebates are significantly greater than the reserves we have established the actual results would decrease our future reported revenue conversely if actual returns and rebates are significantly less than our reserves this would increase our future reported revenue for example if we had increased our fiscal 2009 returns reserves by 1 of nonconsignment sales to retailers for quickbooks turbotax and quicken our total net revenue for fiscal 2009 would have been about 30 million lower 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

we make ongoing assumptions relating to the collectibility of our accounts receivable the accounts receivable amount on our balance sheet includes a reserve for accounts that might not be paid in determining the amount of the reserve we consider our historical level of credit losses we also make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations and we assess current economic trends that might impact the level of credit losses in the future our reserves have generally been adequate to cover our actual credit losses however since we cannot reliably predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers we cannot guarantee that our reserves will continue to be adequate if actual credit losses are significantly greater than the reserve we have established that would increase our general and administrative expenses and reduce our reported net income conversely if actual credit losses are significantly less than our reserve this would eventually decrease our general and administrative expenses and increase our reported net income 

fair value of investments 

we estimate the fair value of our availableforsale securities each quarter these investments consist of cash equivalents municipal bonds us agency securities corporate notes and municipal auction rate securities fair value is defined as the price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date when identical or similar assets are traded in active markets the level of judgment required to estimate their fair value is relatively low this is generally true for our cash equivalents municipal bonds us agency securities and corporate notes however significant judgment is required to estimate the fair value of assets and liabilities when observable inputs are not available for example we use a discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of our municipal auction rate securities because we have determined that the market for those securities is inactive we based this determination on the fact that due to a decrease in liquidity in the global credit markets regularly scheduled auctions for the municipal auction rate securities we hold have generally failed since february 2008 some of the key inputs to our discounted cash flow model are inherently uncertain the key inputs include projected future interest rates the likely timing of principal repayments the probability of full repayment publicly available pricing data for recently issued similar securities that are not subject to auctions and the impact of the reduced liquidity for auction rate securities at july 31 2009 we held a total of 2445 million in municipal auction rate securities 

we record unrealized gains and losses on our availableforsale securities in other comprehensive income in the equity section of our balance sheet until the security is sold or we determine that the decrease in fair value is otherthantemporary we consider a number of factors in determining whether to recognize an impairment charge including the reason for the decrease in fair value the severity of the decrease in fair value the length of time that the fair value has been less than the cost basis of the security the financial condition and nearterm prospects of the issuer and whether we intend to sell or may be required to sell the security before anticipated recovery of our cost basis changes in our estimates of the fair values of our availableforsale securities may result in material increases or decreases in our net income in the period in which the change occurs 

business combinations — purchase accounting 

under the purchase method of accounting we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values we record the excess of purchase price over the aggregate fair values as goodwill we engage thirdparty appraisal firms to assist us in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed these valuations require us to make significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets critical estimates in valuing purchased technology customer lists and other identifiable intangible assets include future cash flows that we expect to generate from the acquired assets if the subsequent actual results and updated projections of the underlying 

business activity change compared with the assumptions and projections used to develop these values we could experience impairment charges in addition we have estimated the economic lives of certain acquired assets and these lives are used to calculate depreciation and amortization expense if our estimates of the economic lives change depreciation or amortization expenses could be accelerated or slowed

goodwill purchased intangible assets and other longlived assets — impairment assessments 

we estimate the fair value of purchased intangible assets and other longlived assets that have finite useful lives whenever an event or change in circumstances indicates that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable we test for potential impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives annually in our fourth fiscal quarter or whenever indicators of impairment arise the timing of the annual test may result in charges to our statement of operations in our fourth fiscal quarter that could not have been reasonably foreseen in prior periods

in order to estimate the fair value of goodwill we use a weighted combination of a discounted cash flow model known as the income approach and comparisons to publicly traded companies engaged in similar businesses known as the market approach the income approach requires us to use a number of assumptions including market factors specific to the business the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows to be generated by the business over an extended period of time longterm growth rates for the business and a rate of return that considers the relative risk of achieving the cash flows and the time value of money we evaluate cash flows at the reporting unit level and the number of reporting units that we have identified may make impairment more probable than it would be at a company with fewer reporting units and more integrated operations following acquisitions although the assumptions we use in our discounted cash flow model are consistent with the assumptions we use to generate our internal strategic plans and forecasts significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of future cash flows from each reporting unit and the relative risk of achieving those cash flows when using the market approach we make judgments about the comparability of publicly traded companies engaged in similar businesses we base our judgments on factors such as size growth rates profitability risk and return on investment we also make judgments when adjusting market multiples of revenue operating income and earnings for these companies to reflect their relative similarity to our own businesses we had a total of 18 billion in goodwill on our balance sheet at july 31 2009 see note 4 to the financial statements in item 8 for a summary of goodwill by reportable segment

in order to estimate the fair value of purchased intangible assets and other longlived assets that have finite useful lives we estimate the present value of future cash flows from those assets the key assumptions that we use in our discounted cash flow model are the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows to be generated by the asset over an extended period of time and a rate of return that considers the relative risk of achieving the cash flows and the time value of money significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of future cash flows and the relative risk of achieving those cash flows we also make judgments about the remaining useful lives of purchased intangible assets and other longlived assets that have finite lives we had a total of 2930 million in net purchased intangible assets on our balance sheet at july 31 2009

assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives are complex and often subjective they can be affected by a variety of factors including external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts for example if our future operating results do not meet current forecasts or if we experience a sustained decline in our market capitalization that is determined to be indicative of a reduction in fair value of one or more of our reporting units we may be required to record future impairment charges for goodwill and purchased intangible assets impairment charges could materially decrease our future net income and result in lower asset values on our balance sheet

accounting for sharebased compensation plans 

at july 31 2009 there was 2400 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested sharebased compensation arrangements granted under all equity compensation plans which we will amortize to expense in the future total unrecognized compensation cost will be adjusted for future changes in estimated forfeitures we expect to recognize that cost over a weighted average vesting period of 21 years

we use a lattice binomial model and the assumptions shown in note 12 to the financial statements in item 8 to estimate the fair value of stock options granted we estimate the expected term of options granted based on implied exercise patterns using a binomial model we estimate the volatility of our common stock at the date of grant based on the implied volatility of publicly traded oneyear and twoyear options on our common stock our decision to use implied volatility was based upon the availability of actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility we base the riskfree interest rate that we use in our option valuation model on the implied yield in effect at the time of option grant on constant maturity us treasury issues with equivalent remaining terms we have never paid any cash dividends on our common stock and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future consequently we use an expected dividend yield of zero in our option valuation model we estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates we use historical data to estimate prevesting option forfeitures and record sharebased compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest we amortize the fair value of options on a straightline basis over the requisite service periods of the awards which are generally the vesting periods we may elect to use different assumptions under our option valuation model in the future which could materially affect our net income or loss and net income or loss per share we value restricted stock units using the intrinsic value method we amortize the value of restricted stock units on a straightline basis over the restriction period 

legal contingencies 

we are subject to certain legal proceedings as well as demands claims and threatened litigation that arise in the normal course of our business we review the status of each significant matter quarterly and assess our potential financial exposure if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated we record a liability and an expense for the estimated loss significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination of whether an exposure is reasonably estimable our accruals are based on the best information available at the time as additional information becomes available we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates potential legal liabilities and the revision of estimates of potential legal liabilities could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 

income taxes — estimates of effective tax rates deferred taxes and valuation allowance 

when we prepare our financial statements we estimate our income taxes based on the various jurisdictions where we conduct business significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax rules and the potential for future adjustment of our uncertain tax positions by the internal revenue service or other taxing jurisdiction we estimate our current tax liability and assess temporary differences that result from differing treatments of certain items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which we show on our balance sheet we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized to the extent we believe that realization is not likely we establish a valuation allowance when we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in an accounting period we record a corresponding tax expense in our statement of operations 

at july 31 2009 we had net deferred tax assets of 1287 million which included a valuation allowance of 57 million for certain state net operating loss carryforwards we recorded the valuation allowance to reflect uncertainties about whether we will be able to utilize some of our deferred tax assets before they expire the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income for the jurisdictions in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be realizable while we have considered future taxable income in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we could in the future be required to increase the valuation allowance to take into account additional deferred tax assets that we may be unable to realize an increase in the valuation allowance would have an adverse impact which could be material on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which we record the increase 

we recognize and measure benefits for uncertain tax positions using a twostep approach the first step is to evaluate the tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon audit including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes for tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely 

of being realized upon settlement significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions we evaluate our uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis our evaluations are based upon a number of factors including changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law correspondence with tax authorities during the course of audits and effective settlement of audit issues changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in material increases or decreases in our income tax expense in the period in which we make the change which could have a material impact on our effective tax rate and operating results 

results of operations 

financial overview 

 

total net revenue increased 1115 million or 4 in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008 consumer tax segment revenue increased 670 million or 7 in fiscal 2009 due to 36 growth in turbotax online units which more than offset an 11 decrease in turbotax desktop units payments solutions segment revenue increased 374 million or 15 in fiscal 2009 due to growth in the core merchant services customer base and revenue from echo partially offset by a decline in transaction processing volume per customer employee management solutions segment revenue increased 279 million or 8 in fiscal 2009 due to the realization of the full effect of pricing changes made in fiscal 2008 accounting professionals segment revenue increased 251 million or 8 in fiscal 2009 due to price increases and financial institutions revenue increased 125 million or 4 due to growth in internet banking and billpay end users partially offset by a decline in revenue per end user revenue in our other businesses segment decreased 451 million or 14 in fiscal 2009 and revenue in our financial management solutions segment decreased 133 million or 2 we believe that fiscal 2009 revenue in these two segments was affected by slower small business and consumer spending see “total net revenue by business segment” later in this item 7 for more information 

operating income from continuing operations for fiscal 2009 increased 313 million or 5 compared with fiscal 2008 the increase in operating income was due to 1115 million in higher revenue partially offset by 802 million in higher costs and expenses in fiscal 2009 total costs and expenses increased about 49 million due to our fiscal 2008 acquisitions of homestead and echo about 31 million due to higher advertising and other marketing expenses to support the launch and subsequent promotion of turbotax 2008 and quickbooks 2009 about 27 million due to higher depreciation expense for investments in our infrastructure about 20 million due to higher sharebased compensation expense and 126 million due to a charge for the historical use of certain technology licensing rights these increases in total costs and expenses were partially offset by decreases of about 45 million due to lower performance incentive payouts and about 33 million in compensation and benefit savings due to lower staffing levels and lower severance related charges in fiscal 2009 see “cost of revenue” and “operating expenses” later in this item 7 for more information 

net income from continuing operations decreased 38 million or 1 in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008 in fiscal 2008 we recorded a pretax gain of 516 million on the sale of certain outsourced payroll assets there was no comparable transaction in fiscal 2009 see “dispositions and discontinued operations” later in this item 7 for more information in addition interest and other income decreased 250 million in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008 the impact of lower interest rates more than offset the impact of higher average invested balances and resulted in 185 million lower interest income due to certain discrete tax items our effective tax rate for fiscal 

2009 was 31 our effective tax rate for fiscal 2008 was 35 see “income taxes” later in this item 7 for more information about our effective tax rates for these periods 

due to the foregoing factors diluted net income per share from continuing operations of 135 in fiscal 2009 increased 2 compared with 133 in fiscal 2008 

total net revenue by business segment 

the table below and the discussion of total net revenue that follows it are organized in accordance with our seven reportable business segments see note 15 to the financial statements in item 8 for descriptions of product revenue and service and other revenue for each segment 

we have reclassified segment results for all periods presented to reflect the continued evolution of our business we no longer combine results for our payroll operating segment with results for our payments operating segment because management currently views these businesses separately we also changed the name of our quickbooks segment to financial management solutions our new payroll segment to employee management solutions and our new payments segment to payments solutions we transferred revenue for our point of sale offerings from our financial management solutions segment to our payments solutions segment to align this product group more closely with the customers they serve total point of sale revenue was less than 40 million for all periods presented we also reclassified certain retail sales expenses from common expenses to segment income or loss consistent with how management now views these expenses these expenses were less than 25 million for all periods presented 

 

financial management solutions formerly known as quickbooks 

fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008 financial management solutions total net revenue decreased 133 million or 2 in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008 excluding revenue from homestead which we acquired in december 2007 financial management solutions total net revenue decreased 6 in fiscal 2009 total quickbooks software unit sales including activations of our free simple start offering were up 6 in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008 revenue per quickbooks unit was lower in fiscal 2009 due to price promotion programs in some of our sales channels quickbooks online subscriptions grew 11 and active quickbooks enterprise solutions customers were up 12 in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008 

fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007  financial management solutions total net revenue increased 409 million or 7 in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 excluding revenue from homestead which we acquired in december 2007 financial management solutions total net revenue increased 5 in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 total quickbooks software unit sales including activations of our free simple start offering were up slightly in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 revenue growth in fiscal 2008 was driven by a 14 increase in quickbooks online subscribers a 22 increase in the number of active quickbooks enterprise solutions customers and 8 growth in revenue from secondary products and services sold in conjunction with quickbooks software units 

employee management solutions formerly known as payroll 

fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008 employee management solutions total net revenue increased 279 million or 8 in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008 due predominantly to the realization of the full effect in fiscal 2009 of pricing changes made in fiscal 2008 paycycle which we acquired in july 2009 had a negligible effect on fiscal 2009 employee management solutions revenue 

fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 employee management solutions total net revenue decreased 114 million or 3 in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 as we completed the transition of portions of our complete payroll and premier payroll services customer base in connection with a sale of assets to adp we estimate that revenue growth in this segment in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 would have been approximately 9 when adjusted for the impact of the sale of those payroll customers 

payments solutions 

fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008 payments solutions total net revenue increased 374 million or 15 in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008 revenue in fiscal 2009 increased due to 14 growth in our core merchant services customer base and revenue from echo which we acquired in february 2008 transaction volume per customer was down about 8 in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008 reflecting an overall reduction in consumer spending associated with the current economic environment excluding revenue from echo payments solutions segment revenue increased approximately 8 in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008 

fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 payments solutions total net revenue increased 502 million or 25 in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 due to 18 growth in our core merchant services customer base and revenue from echo which we acquired in february 2008 we estimate that revenue growth in our payments solutions segment in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 would have been approximately 17 when adjusted for the impact of our acquisition of echo 

consumer tax 

fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008 consumer tax total net revenue increased 670 million or 7 in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008 the fiscal 2009 revenue increase was due to 36 growth in federal turbotax online units which more than offset an 11 decrease in federal turbotax desktop units we included federal electronic filing services with our turbotax desktop software for the first time in the 2008 tax year net of related price increases we estimate that this decision resulted in a reduction of about 25 million in consumer tax revenue for fiscal 2009 

fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 consumer tax total net revenue increased 1165 million or 14 in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 the fiscal 2008 revenue increase was due to 17 growth in total federal turbotax units which was driven by 37 growth in turbotax online units turbotax desktop units were flat in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 

accounting professionals 

fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008 accounting professionals total net revenue increased 251 million or 8 in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008 due to price increases 

fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 accounting professionals total net revenue increased 125 million or 4 in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 we discontinued our proseries express product line in fiscal 2008 which we estimate resulted in a loss of five percentage points of growth for the accounting professionals segment in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 

financial institutions 

fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008 financial institutions total net revenue increased 125 million or 4 in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008 internet banking end users increased 3 and billpay end users were up 20 in fiscal 2009 lower revenue per user partially offset growth in the internet banking and billpay customer bases 

fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 financial institutions total net revenue increased 1482 million to 2986 million in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 due mainly to revenue from digital insight which we acquired in february 2007 in fiscal 2008 internet banking end users grew 10 and billpay end users grew 16 

other businesses 

fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008 other businesses total net revenue decreased 451 million or 14 in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008 quicken sales were down 15 in fiscal 2009 due to the overall reduction in consumer spending in addition the stronger us dollar contributed to a decline in canadian revenue and revenue from our business in the uk lowering other businesses segment revenue growth by approximately seven percentage points in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008 

fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 other businesses total net revenue increased 412 million or 14 in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 in fiscal 2008 revenue from our businesses in canada and the united kingdom increased 28 revenue from our intuit real estate solutions business grew 17 and quicken revenue was flat compared with fiscal 2007 the weaker us dollar contributed to canadian revenue growth accounting for approximately five percentage points of other businesses segment revenue growth in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 

cost of revenue 

 

our cost of revenue has three components 1 cost of product revenue which includes the direct costs of manufacturing and shipping our desktop software products 2 cost of service and other revenue which reflects direct costs associated with providing services including data center costs related to delivering internetbased services and costs associated with revenue sharing and online transactions revenue and 3 amortization of purchased intangible assets which represents the cost of amortizing developed technologies that we have obtained through acquisitions over their useful lives

fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008 cost of product revenue as a percentage of product revenue increased slightly to 11 in fiscal 2009 from 10 in fiscal 2008 due to product mix cost of service and other revenue as a percentage of service and other revenue decreased slightly to 25 in fiscal 2009 from 26 in fiscal 2008 due to an increase of 1222 million in revenue from turbotax online and consumer electronic tax filing services which have relatively lower costs of service revenue compared with our other service offerings partially offsetting this benefit fiscal 2009 cost of service and other revenue included a 126 million charge for the historical use of certain technology licensing rights that we acquired in may 2009

amortization of purchased intangible assets increased in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008 due primarily to the amortization of homestead and echo purchased intangible assets which we acquired in fiscal 2008

fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 cost of product revenue as a percentage of product revenue decreased to 10 in fiscal 2008 from 12 in fiscal 2007 due to cost efficiencies achieved for our quickbooks 2008 and consumer tax product lines cost of service and other revenue as a percentage of service and other revenue increased slightly to 26 in fiscal 2008 from 25 in fiscal 2007 the impact of our acquisition of digital insight which has relatively higher costs of service revenue was partially offset by the impact of 1056 million growth in revenue from turbotax online and consumer electronic tax filing services which have relatively lower costs of service revenue compared with our other service offerings

amortization of purchased intangible assets increased in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 due primarily to the amortization of digital insight purchased intangible assets which we acquired in february 2007

incentive payouts and about 33 million in compensation and benefit savings due to lower staffing levels and lower severance related charges in fiscal 2009

including digital insight homestead echo sharebased compensation expense and the restructuring charge about half of the increase in total operating expenses in dollars for fiscal 2008 was due to higher research and development expenses during this period we continued to invest in research and development for existing offerings as well as for new offerings almost 45 of the fiscal 2008 increase in total operating expenses in dollars was due to higher selling and marketing expenses of the total increase in selling and marketing expenses in dollars for this period about a third was due to our acquisition of digital insight whose selling costs are relatively higher compared with our other businesses because they sell their services to financial institutions through a direct sales force about 20 of the fiscal 2008 increase in selling and marketing expenses in dollars was due to higher advertising and other marketing expenses to support our consumer tax offerings excluding the impact of the increase in sharebased compensation expense general and administrative expenses declined about 5 million in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007

other businesses 

fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008 other businesses segment operating income as a percentage of related revenue decreased to 23 in fiscal 2009 from 30 in fiscal 2008 due to the decrease in segment revenue in fiscal 2009 while revenue from our businesses in canada and the uk was lower in fiscal 2009 by approximately 23 million due to the stronger us dollar total costs and expenses for this segment were also lower by approximately 13 million due to the impact of foreign exchange rates

interest and other income 

 

interest and other income consists primarily of interest income the impact of lower interest rates more than offset the impact of higher average invested balances and resulted in lower interest income in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008 lower interest rates and lower average invested balances resulted in lower interest income in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 we record gains and losses associated with executive deferred compensation plan assets in interest and other income and gains and losses associated with the related liabilities in operating expense the amounts recorded in operating expense generally offset the amounts recorded in interest and other income total interest and other income for all periods presented included royalties and fees from trademark license and distribution agreements that we entered into when we sold our quicken loans mortgage business in july 2002 

income taxes 

effective tax rate 

our effective tax rate for fiscal 2009 was approximately 31 excluding discrete tax benefits primarily related to a favorable agreement we entered into with a tax authority and the retroactive reinstatement of the federal research and experimentation credit our effective tax rate for that period was approximately 35 and did not differ significantly from the federal statutory rate of 35 state income taxes were partially offset primarily by the benefit we received from federal and state research and experimentation credits the domestic production activities deduction and tax exempt interest income 

our effective tax rate for fiscal 2008 was 35 and did not differ significantly from the federal statutory rate of 35 state income taxes were offset primarily by the benefit we received from tax exempt interest income the domestic production activities deduction and federal and state research and experimentation credits 

our effective tax rate for fiscal 2007 was 36 and did not differ significantly from the federal statutory rate of 35 state income taxes were partially offset by the benefit we received from tax exempt interest income federal and state research and experimentation credits and the domestic production activities deduction in addition in fiscal 2007 we benefited from the retroactive extension of the federal research and experimentation credit 

in january 2009 we entered into a favorable agreement with a state tax authority with respect to certain tax years including years ended prior to fiscal 2009 as a result of this agreement we recorded a discrete tax benefit of 180 million during the twelve months ended july 31 2009 

in october 2008 changes in federal tax law resulted in the reinstatement of the federal research and experimentation credit through december 31 2009 that was retroactive to january 1 2008 in december 2006 changes in federal tax law resulted in the reinstatement of the federal research and experimentation credit through december 31 2007 that was retroactive to january 1 2006 we recorded discrete tax benefits of approximately 69 million and 37 million for the retroactive amounts related to fiscal years 2008 and 2006 during the twelve months ended july 31 2009 and 2007

we acquired paycycle in fiscal 2009 and echo and homestead in fiscal 2008 see note 6 to the financial statements in item 8 these companies had federal net operating loss carryforwards at their respective dates of acquisition that totaled approximately 126 million we have recorded the tax effects of these carryforwards which together totaled approximately 44 million as deferred tax assets at the respective dates of acquisition the carryforwards do not result in an income tax provision benefit but they reduce income taxes payable and cash paid for income taxes as we utilize them at july 31 2009 we had total federal net operating loss carryforwards of 1040 million that will expire starting in fiscal 2019 

net deferred tax assets 

at july 31 2009 we had net deferred tax assets of 1287 million which included a valuation allowance of 57 million for certain state net operating loss carryforwards we recorded the valuation allowance to reflect uncertainties about whether we will be able to utilize some of our deferred tax assets before they expire while we believe our current valuation allowance is sufficient we could in the future be required to increase the valuation allowance to take into account additional deferred tax assets that we may be unable to realize we assess the need for an adjustment to the valuation allowance on a quarterly basis the assessment is based on our estimates of future sources of taxable income for the jurisdictions in which we operate and the periods over which our deferred tax assets will be realizable see note 11 to the financial statements in item 8 for more information

liquidity and capital resources 

overview 

at july 31 2009 our cash cash equivalents and investments totaled 13 billion an increase of 5192 million from july 31 2008 due to the factors described in “statements of cash flows” below cash cash equivalents and investments at july 31 2009 included 1509 in municipal auction rate securities we did not classify any of the municipal auction rate securities we held at july 31 2008 as cash cash equivalents and investments at july 31 

2009 and 2008 we also held 936 million and 2853 million in municipal auction rate securities that we classified as longterm investments on our balance sheet see “auction rate securities” below for more information our primary source of liquidity has been cash from operations which entails the collection of accounts receivable for products and services our primary uses of cash have been for research and development programs selling and marketing activities capital projects acquisitions of businesses debt service costs and repurchases of common stock 

in march 2007 we issued fiveyear and tenyear senior unsecured notes totaling 1 billion in connection with our acquisition of digital insight we also have a 500 million unsecured revolving line of credit facility that is described later in this item 7 to date we have not borrowed under the facility 

the following table summarizes selected measures of our liquidity and capital resources at the dates indicated 

 

auction rate securities 

at july 31 2009 we held a total of 2445 million in municipal auction rate securities based on the maturities of the underlying securities and the put option described below we classified 1509 million of these securities as shortterm investments and 936 million of these securities as longterm investments on our balance sheet at that date all of the municipal auction rate securities we held at july 31 2009 were rated a or better by the major credit rating agencies and 86 were collateralized by student loans guaranteed by the us department of education these securities are longterm debt instruments that are intended to provide liquidity through a dutch auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at predetermined intervals typically every 35 days due to a decrease in liquidity in the global credit markets in february 2008 auctions began failing for the municipal auction rate securities we held regularly scheduled auctions for these securities have generally continued to fail since that time when these auctions initially failed higher interest rates for many of the securities went into effect in accordance with the terms of the prospectus for each security as of july 31 2009 we had received all interest payments in accordance with the contractual terms of these securities during fiscal 2009 issuers redeemed at par value 408 million of municipal auction rate securities that we held 

in august 2008 the brokerdealers for our municipal auction rate securities announced settlements under which they may provide liquidity solutions or purchase the auction rate securities held by their institutional clients on november 4 2008 we accepted an offer from ubs ag ubs one of the brokerdealers for our municipal auction rate securities that gives us the option to sell ubs a total of 1409 million in municipal auction rate securities at par value at any time during a twoyear period beginning june 30 2010 the offer also gives ubs the discretion to buy any or all of these municipal auction rate securities from us at par value at any time to date ubs has not purchased any of these securities from us we currently intend to exercise our option to sell ubs all of these municipal auction rate securities at par value in accordance with the terms of the offer within the next twelve months we continue to have counterparty risk associated with ubs 

based on our expected operating cash flows and our other sources of cash we do not believe that the reduction in liquidity of our municipal auction rate securities will have a material impact on our overall ability to meet our liquidity needs

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

investment portfolio 

there has been significant deterioration and instability in the financial markets during fiscal 2009 this period of extraordinary disruption and readjustment in the financial markets exposes us to additional investment risk the value and liquidity of the securities in which we invest could deteriorate rapidly and the issuers of these securities could be subject to credit rating downgrades in light of the current market conditions and these additional risks we actively monitor market conditions and developments specific to the securities in which we invest we believe that we take a conservative approach to investing our funds in that we invest only in highlyrated securities and diversify our portfolio of investments while we believe we take prudent measures to mitigate investment related risks such risks cannot be fully eliminated because of market circumstances that are outside our control 

our investments consist of instruments that meet quality standards that are consistent with our investment policy this policy specifies that except for direct obligations of the united states government securities issued by agencies of the united states government and money market funds we diversify our investments by limiting our holdings with any individual issuer we do not hold derivative financial instruments in our portfolio of investments 

see note 10 to the financial statements in item 8 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — liquidity and capital resources” in item 7 and “risk factors” in item 1a of this annual report on form 10k for a description of market events that have affected the liquidity of certain municipal auction rate securities that we held at july 31 2009 

the following table presents our portfolio of cash equivalents and availableforsale debt securities as of july 31 2009 by stated maturity the table is classified by the original maturity date listed on the security and includes cash equivalents which consist primarily of money market funds at july 31 2009 the weighted average tax adjusted interest rate earned on our money market accounts was 057 and the weighted average tax adjusted interest rate earned on our investments was 120 

 

interest rate risk 

our cash equivalents and investments are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates interest rate movements affect the interest income we earn on cash equivalents and investments and the value of those investments should the federal reserve target rate increase by 25 basis points from the level of july 31 2009 the value of our investments would decrease by approximately 09 million should the federal reserve target rate increase by 100 basis points from the level of july 31 2009 the value of our investments would decrease by approximately 36 million 

we are also exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates as they affect our 500 million revolving credit facility advances under the credit facility accrue interest at rates that are equal to citibank’s base rate or the london interbank offered rate libor plus a margin that ranges from 018 to 0575 based on our senior debt credit ratings consequently our interest expense would fluctuate with changes in the general level of these interest rates if we were to borrow any amounts under the credit facility at july 31 2009 no amounts were outstanding under the credit facility 

on march 12 2007 we issued 500 million of 540 senior unsecured notes due on march 15 2012 and 500 million of 575 senior unsecured notes due on march 15 2017 since these senior notes bear interest at fixed rates they are not subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates 

impact of foreign currency rate changes 

the functional currencies of our international operating subsidiaries are the local currencies we translate the assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries at the exchange rates in effect on the balance sheet date we translate their revenue costs and expenses at the average rates of exchange in effect during the period we include translation gains and losses in the stockholders’ equity section of our balance sheets we include net gains and losses resulting from foreign exchange transactions in interest and other income in our statements of operations 

since we translate foreign currencies primarily canadian dollars british pounds indian rupees and singapore dollars into us dollars for financial reporting purposes currency fluctuations can have an impact on our financial results the historical impact of currency fluctuations has generally been immaterial we believe that our exposure to currency exchange fluctuation risk is not significant primarily because our global subsidiaries invoice customers and satisfy their financial obligations almost exclusively in their local currencies although the impact of currency fluctuations on our financial results has generally been immaterial in the past and we believe that for the reasons cited above currency fluctuations will not be significant in the future there can be no guarantee that the impact of currency fluctuations will not be material in the future as of july 31 2009 we did not engage in foreign currency hedging activities

product development 

since the markets for software and related services are characterized by rapid technological change shifting customer needs and frequent new product introductions and enhancements a continuous high level of investment is required to innovate and develop new products and services and to enhance existing offerings we develop the majority of our products and services internally we also supplement our internal development efforts by acquiring or licensing products and technology from third parties and establishing other relationships that enable us to enhance or expand our offerings more rapidly we have a number of united states patents and pending applications that relate to various aspects of our products and technology 

our traditional core desktop software products – quickbooks turbotax lacerte proseries and quicken – tend to have predictable annual development and product release cycles we also develop new products for which development cycles are less predictable developing consumer and professional tax software and services presents unique challenges because of the demanding development cycle required to accurately incorporate tax law and tax 

form changes within a rigid timetable the development timing for our other small business and financial institutions offerings varies with business needs and regulatory requirements and the length of the development cycle depends on the scope and complexity of each particular project 

in our financial institutions business we have developed interfaces with the systems of many of the major providers of core processing software and services to financial institutions these system interfaces allow us to access a financial institution’s host system to provide end users access to their account data in addition to developing new interfaces we continue to enhance our many existing interfaces in order to deliver more robust connectivity and increase operating efficiencies 

we continue to make substantial investments in research and development and we expect to focus our future research and development efforts on enhancing existing products and services and on developing new products and services that will offer increased ease of use be customized for specific customer categories be webintegrated or webbased and feature improved integration with other intuit and third party products and services and with our internal information systems we also expect to continue to focus significant research and development efforts on multiyear projects to update the technology platforms for several of our products our research and development expenses were 6058 million or 20 of total net revenue in fiscal 2008 4725 million or 17 of total net revenue in fiscal 2007 and 3858 million or 17 of total net revenue in fiscal 2006 

seasonality 

our quickbooks consumer tax and accounting professionals businesses are highly seasonal some of our other offerings are also seasonal but to a lesser extent revenue from our quickbooks software products tends to be highest during our second and third fiscal quarters although the timing of new product releases or changes in our offerings can materially shift revenue between quarters sales of income tax preparation products and services are heavily concentrated in the period from november through april in our consumer tax business a greater proportion of our revenue has been occurring later in this seasonal period due in part to the growth in sales of turbotax online for which revenue is recognized upon printing or electronic filing of a tax return the seasonality of our consumer tax and accounting professionals revenue is also affected by the timing of the availability of tax forms from taxing agencies and the ability of those agencies to receive electronic tax return submissions delays in the availability of tax forms or the ability of taxing agencies to receive submissions can cause revenue to shift from our second fiscal quarter to our third fiscal quarter these seasonal patterns mean that our total net revenue is usually highest during our second quarter ending january 31 and third quarter ending april 30 we typically report losses in our first quarter ending october 31 and fourth quarter ending july 31 when revenue from our tax businesses is minimal while operating expenses continue at relatively consistent levels we believe the seasonality of our revenue is likely to continue in the future 

marketing sales and distribution channels 

markets 

our primary target customers are small and medium sized businesses consumers accounting professionals and small and medium sized financial institutions the markets in which we compete have always been characterized by rapid technological change shifting customer needs and frequent new product introductions and enhancements by competitors over the past few years the internet has accelerated the pace of change and revolutionized the way that customers learn about and purchase products and services realtime personalized online shopping experiences are rapidly becoming the standard many customers now begin their shopping process online and make their purchase either online or at a retail location this drives the need to create integrated multichannel shop and buy experiences market and industry changes are quickly rendering existing products and services obsolete so our success depends on our ability to respond rapidly to these changes with new business models updated competitive strategies new or enhanced products and services alternative distribution methods and other changes in the way we do business

sales and distribution channels 

multichannel shop and buy experiences our consumer and small business customers increasingly use the internet to research both online and desktop products and services some customers buy and use our products and services entirely online others purchase desktop products and services using the internet still others prefer to make their final decision at a retail location we coordinate our web sites promotions and retail displays in support of this integrated multichannel shop and buy model 

direct sales channel  we sell many of our products and services for small businesses consumers and accounting professionals directly to our customers through our web sites and call centers telesales continues to be an effective channel for serving customers that want live help selecting the products and services that are right for their needs 

in our financial institutions business we sell our products and services to financial institutions using a direct sales model and to a lesser extent in cooperation with core processing partners our typical sales cycle is approximately six to twelve months for new financial institutions and four to six months for addon sales to existing customers

oem alliance partner and solution provider channels we have strategies to address the original equipment manufacturer oem alliance partner and solution provider channels revenue from these channels is currently less significant than revenue from our direct and retail channels but it is growing relationships with selected personal computer oems help us attract new customers and generate sales of our core desktop software products we also sell our consumer and small business products and services through selected alliance partners primarily banks credit unions and savings and investment firms these alliance partners help us reach new customers at the point of transaction and drive growth and market share by extending our online reach solution providers combine our products and services with valueadded marketing sales and technical expertise to deliver a complete solution at the local level

competition 

overview 

we face intense competition in all of our businesses both domestically and internationally competitive interest and expertise in many of the markets we serve particularly small business consumer tax and online banking has grown markedly over the past few years and we expect this trend to continue some of our existing competitors have significantly greater financial technical and marketing resources than we do in addition the competitive landscape can shift rapidly as new companies enter markets in which we compete this is particularly true for online products and services where the barriers to entry are lower than they are for desktop software products and services to attract customers many new online competitors are offering free or lowpriced entrylevel products which we must take into account in our pricing strategies 

our most obvious competition comes from other companies that offer technology solutions similar to ours however for many of our products and services other important competitive alternatives for customers are third party service providers such as professional accountants and seasonal assisted tax preparation businesses manual tools and processes or generalpurpose software are also important competitive alternatives many of our new customers previously used pencil and paper or software such as word processors and spreadsheets rather than competitors’ software and services to perform financial tasks we believe that there is a longterm trend away from manual methods and toward the use of both desktop and online software to accomplish these tasks that will provide future growth opportunities 

competition specific to business segments 

small business quickbooks is the leading product in the retail sales channel for its category we face competitive challenges in our quickbooks business and our payroll and payments business from microsoft corporation which offers accounting software and associated services that directly target small business customers increasingly our small business products and services also face competition from free or low cost online accounting offerings as well as free online banking and bill payment services offered by financial institutions and others in our merchant services business we also compete directly with a number of independent sales organizations none of which dominates the market 

consumer tax  in the private sector we face intense competition primarily from hr block the makers of taxcut software and from 2nd story software’s taxact an online offering that subjects us to significant price pressure we also compete for customers with assisted tax preparation businesses such as hr block 

we face potential competitive challenges in our consumer tax business from publicly funded government entities that offer electronic tax preparation and filing services at no cost to individual taxpayers we are a member of the free file alliance a consortium of private sector companies that entered into an agreement with the federal government that is scheduled to expire in october 2009 under this agreement a number of private sector companies rather than the federal government have been providing online federal tax preparation and filing services at no cost to eligible federal taxpayers through initiatives such as our intuit tax freedom project approximately 20 states have also adopted free file alliance publicprivate agreements while approximately 20 other states offer some form of direct government tax preparation and filing services free to qualified taxpayers we continue to actively work with others in the private and public sectors to advance the goals of the free file alliance policy initiative and to support successful publicprivate partnerships however future administrative regulatory or legislative activity in this area could harm our consumer tax business 

accounting professionals our proseries professional tax offerings face pricing pressure from competitors who may offer deep product discounts or lower prices our lacerte professional tax offerings face competition from competitivelypriced tax and accounting solutions that include integration with nontax functionality we also face growing competition from online offerings which may be marketed more effectively or have lower pricing than our offerings for accounting professionals 

financial institutions the market for internet banking services is highly competitive in the area of consumer internet banking we primarily compete with other companies that provide outsourced online banking services to financial institutions including online resources s1 corporation and fundsxpress a subsidiary of first data corporation also vendors such as corillian part of fiserv that primarily target the largest financial institutions 

occasionally compete with us in our market segment in addition fiserv open solutions inc fidelity information services inc jack henry metavante corporation and several other vendors of core processing services to financial institutions offer their own online banking products although many of these firms also offer our products through a referral or reseller arrangement with us 

the following table shows the significant competitors for each of our major products and services 

 

competitive factors 

we believe the most important competitive factors for our core software products – quickbooks turbotax lacerte proseries and quicken – are ease of use product features size of the installed customer base brand name recognition value proposition cost and product and support quality access to distribution channels is also important for our quickbooks turbotax and quicken products in addition support from accounting professionals and the ability for customers to upgrade within product families as their businesses grow are significant competitive factors for our quickbooks products productivity is also an important competitive factor for the fullservice accounting firms to which we market our lacerte products we believe we compete effectively on these factors as our quickbooks turbotax and quicken products are the leading products in the retail sales channel for their respective categories 

for our service offerings such as small business payroll merchant payment processing services and outsourced online banking features and ease of use the integration of these products with related software brand name recognition effective distribution quality of support cost and scalability of operations are important competitive factors 

customer service and technical support 

we provide customer service and technical support by telephone email online chat online communities and our customer service and technical support web sites we have fulltime and outsourced customer service and technical support staffs we supplement these staffs with seasonal employees and additional outsourcing during periods of peak call volumes such as during the tax return filing season or following a major product launch we outsource to several firms domestically and internationally most of our internationally outsourced consumer and small business customer service and technical support personnel are currently located in canada and india 

we offer free selfhelp information through our technical support web sites for our quickbooks turbotax accounting professionals and quicken software products customers use our web sites to find answers to commonly asked questions and check on the status of orders under certain support plans customers can also use our web sites to receive product updates electronically support alternatives and fees vary by product we also sponsor online user communities such as turbotax live community where customers can share knowledge and product advice with each other 

manufacturing and distribution 

desktop software and supplies 

the main steps involved in manufacturing desktop software are manufacturing compact discs cds printing boxes and related materials and assembling and shipping the final products 

for retail manufacturing we have an agreement with arvato digital services inc adis a division of bertelsmann ag under which adis provides a large majority of the manufacturing volume for our launches of quickbooks turbotax and quicken as well as for daytoday replenishment after product launches adis has operations in multiple locations that can provide redundancy if necessary we also have an agreement with jvc america inc under which jvc provides secondary outsourced manufacturing volume for these launches and for daytoday replenishment 

for retail distribution we have an agreement with adis under which adis handles all logistics services our retail product launches are operationally complex our model for product delivery for retail launches and replenishment is a hybrid of direct to store deliveries and shipments to central warehouse locations this allows improved inventory management by our retailers we also ship products for many of our smaller retail customers through distributors 

adis also provides most of the manufacturing volume and distribution services for our direct desktop software orders we have an exclusive agreement with harland clarke a division of mf worldwide corporation to fulfill orders for all of our printed checks and most other products for our financial supplies business 

we have multiple sources for all of our raw materials and availability has historically not been a significant problem for us 

prior to major product releases for our core desktop software products we tend to have significant levels of backlog but at other times backlog is minimal and we typically ship products within a few days of receiving an order because of this fluctuation in backlog we believe that backlog is not a reliable predictor of our future core desktop software sales 

internetbased products and services 

intuit’s data centers house most of the systems networks and databases required to operate and deliver our internetbased products and services these include quickbooks online online payroll services merchant payment processing services web site hosting services for small businesses turbotax online consumer and professional electronic tax filing services digital insight outsourced online banking services and quicken online through our data centers we connect customers to products and services and we store the vast amount of data that represents the content on our web sites as our businesses continue to move toward delivering more online products and services this infrastructure will become even more critical in the future our data centers consist of numerous servers and databases located in several sites across the united states due to our evolving business needs we are building a new data center in washington state to support our longer term hosting and system availability requirements we expect to begin occupying this data center in the second half of fiscal 2009 

privacy and security of customer information and transactions 

we are subject to various federal state and international laws and regulations and to financial institution requirements relating to the privacy and security of customer and employee personal information we are also subject to laws and regulations that apply to telemarketing email activities and credit reporting additional laws in all of these areas are likely to be passed in the future which could result in significant limitations on or changes to the ways in which we can use or transmit the personal information of our customers or employees communicate with our customers and deliver products and services or may significantly increase our compliance costs if our business expands to new industry segments that are regulated for privacy and security or to countries outside the united states that have strict data protections laws our compliance requirements and costs will increase 

through a master privacy policy framework designed to be consistent with globally recognized privacy principles we comply with united states federal and other country guidelines and practices to help ensure that customers and employees are aware of and can control how we use information about them our primary web sites such as quickbookscom and turbotaxcom have been certified by truste an independent nonprofit organization that operates a web site privacy certification program representing industry standard practices to address users’ and regulators’ concerns about online privacy we also use privacy statements to provide notice to customers of our privacy practices as well as provide them the opportunity to furnish instructions with respect to use of their personal information we participate in industry groups whose purpose is to influence public policy and industry best practices for privacy and security 

to address security concerns we use security safeguards to help protect the systems and the information customers give to us from loss misuse and unauthorized alteration whenever customers transmit sensitive information such as a credit card number or tax return data to us through one of our web sites that information is stored on servers that allow encryption of the information as it is transmitted to us we work to protect our systems from unauthorized internal or external access using numerous commercially available computer security products as well as internally developed security procedures and practices 

government regulation 

the financial services industry is subject to extensive and complex federal and state regulation our financial institution customers which include commercial banks and credit unions operate in markets that are subject to rigorous regulatory oversight and supervision the compliance of our products and services with these requirements depends on a variety of factors including the particular functionality the interactive design and the charter or license of the financial institution our financial services customers must independently assess and determine what is required of them under these regulations and are responsible for ensuring that our systems and the design of their web sites conform to their regulatory obligations 

our digital insight subsidiary is not directly subject to federal or state regulations specifically applicable to financial institutions such as banks and credit unions however as a provider of services to financial institutions our digital insight subsidiary is examined by the federal financial institution examination council under the information 

technology examination guidelines although we believe we are not subject to direct supervision by federal and state banking agencies with regard to other regulations we have from time to time agreed to examinations of our business and operations by these agencies 

our consumer tax and accounting professionals businesses are also subject to federal and state government requirements including regulations related to the electronic filing of tax returns the provision of tax preparer assistance and the use and disclosure of customer information in addition we offer certain other products and services such as small business payroll which are subject to special regulatory requirements as we expand our financial institutions tax and small business products and services we may become subject to additional government regulation new laws or regulations may be adopted in these areas that could impose significant limitations on our business and increase our cost of compliance we continually analyze new business opportunities and new businesses that we pursue may require additional costs for regulatory compliance 

we are subject to federal and state laws and government regulations concerning employee safety and health and environmental matters the occupational safety and health administration the environmental protection agency and other federal and state agencies have the authority to put regulations in place that may have an impact on our operations 

intellectual property 

we regard our products as proprietary we protect our intellectual property by relying on a combination of copyright patent trade secret and trademark laws restrictions on disclosure and other methods in particular we have a number of registered trademarks that include intuit quickbooks turbotax lacerte proseries digital insight and quicken we have registered these and other trademarks and service marks in the united states and depending on the relevance of each brand to other markets in many foreign countries most registrations can be renewed perpetually at 10year intervals we also currently hold a small but growing patent portfolio we regularly file applications for patents copyrights and trademarks and service marks in order to protect proprietary intellectual property that we believe is important to our business we also license intellectual property from third parties for use in our products 

we face a number of risks relating to our intellectual property including unauthorized use and unauthorized copying or piracy of our products litigation may be necessary to protect our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others patents that have been issued to us could be determined to be invalid and may not be enforceable against competitive products in every jurisdiction furthermore other parties have asserted and may in the future assert infringement claims against us these claims and any litigation may result in invalidation of our proprietary rights or a finding of infringement against us along with an assessment of damages litigation even if without merit could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention in addition third party licenses may not continue to be available to us on commercially acceptable terms or at all 

employees 

as of july 31 2008 we had approximately 8200 employees in major offices in the united states canada india the united kingdom and other locations we believe our future success and growth will depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees in all areas of our business we do not currently have any collective bargaining agreements with our employees and we believe employee relations are generally good although we have employmentrelated agreements with a number of key employees these agreements do not guarantee continued service we believe we offer competitive compensation and a good working environment we were named one of fortune magazine’s “100 best companies to work for” in each of the last seven years however we face intense competition for qualified employees and we expect to face continuing challenges in recruiting and retention

risk factors 

forwardlooking statements and risk factors 

this annual report on form 10k contains forwardlooking statements all statements in this report other than statements that are purely historical are forwardlooking statements words such as “expect” “anticipate” “intend” “plan” “believe” “forecast” “estimate” “seek” and similar expressions also identify forwardlooking statements in this report forwardlooking statements include without limitation the following 

 

we caution investors that forwardlooking statements are only predictions based on our current expectations about future events and are not guarantees of future performance we encourage you to read carefully all information provided in this report and in our other filings with the sec before deciding to invest in our stock or to maintain or change your investment these forwardlooking statements are based on information as of the filing date of this annual report and we undertake no obligation to revise or update any forwardlooking statement for any reason 

because forwardlooking statements involve risks and uncertainties there are important factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forwardlooking statements these factors include the following 

we face intense competitive pressures in all of our businesses that may harm our operating results 

we face intense competition in all of our business units and we expect competition to remain intense in the future the number resources and sophistication of the companies with whom we compete have increased as we continue to expand our product and service offerings our competitors whether new or wellestablished may introduce new 

and improved products and services bundle new offerings with marketleading products reduce prices gain better access to distribution channels advertise aggressively or beat us to market with new products and services we also face intensified competition from providers of free online and desktop accounting tax banking and other financial services in order to compete we have also introduced free offerings in several categories but we may not be able to attract customers or effectively monetize all of these offerings these actions of our competitors if successful can diminish our revenue and profitability capture market share and harm our ability to acquire and retain customers 

quickbooks payroll and payments losing existing or potential quickbooks customers to competitors causes us to lose potential revenue in the shortterm and limits our opportunities to sell related products and services including payroll and payments offerings in the future many competitors provide accounting and business management products and services to small businesses for example microsoft currently offers a version of its small business accounting software for no additional charge to users of its operating system and offers in partnership with third parties several other competitive products and services for small businesses although we have successfully competed with microsoft in the past microsoft’s small business offerings may have a significant negative impact on our future revenue and profitability as we continue to offer small business services beyond financial management we are likely to come into competition with several other wellestablished companies that may have greater resources market share and other advantages in addition as online services and business models grow in popularity new competitors may face lower barriers to entry and can offer online services that compete directly with our desktop and online offerings 

we may also experience pricing pressure for our small business payroll offerings due to the larger size and economies of scale of certain competitors in that business 

consumer tax  our consumer tax business faces significant competition from both the public and private sector in the public sector we face the risk of federal and state taxing authorities developing or contracting to provide software or other systems to facilitate tax return preparation and electronic filing at no charge to taxpayers 

 

accounting professionals our proseries professional tax offerings face pricing pressure from competitors who may offer deep product discounts or lower prices our lacerte professional tax offerings face competition from competitivelypriced tax and accounting solutions that include integration with nontax functionality we also face growing competition from online offerings which may be marketed more effectively or have lower pricing than our offerings for accounting professionals 

financial institutions we compete with several companies that provide online banking services to financial institutions we face intense competition from two main sources other companies that primarily offer outsourced online banking services and vendors of core processing services to financial institutions also vendors that primarily target the largest financial institutions occasionally compete in our target market in some instances we compete with companies including core processing vendors with whom we also have significant business relationships some of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories and may be in a better position to produce and market their services due to their greater technical marketing and other resources as well as their greater name recognition and larger installed bases of customers many of our competitors including the core processors may have wellestablished relationships with our current and potential financial institution customers which may harm our ability to acquire and retain those customers 

as we negotiate service contract renewals with current customers competitive pressures may require us to make concessions on pricing and other material terms to induce the customer to remain with us if we are unable to compete effectively with other online banking service providers our business results may suffer 

future revenue growth for our core products depends upon our successful introduction of new and enhanced products and services 

a number of our businesses derive a significant amount of their revenue through onetime upfront license fees and rely on customer upgrades and service offerings to generate a significant portion of their revenues in addition our consumer tax business depends significantly on revenue from customers who return each year to use our updated tax preparation and filing software and services as our existing products mature encouraging customers to purchase product upgrades becomes more challenging unless new product releases provide features and functionality that have meaningful incremental value if we are not able to develop and clearly demonstrate the value of upgraded products to our customers our upgrade and service revenues will be harmed similarly our business will be harmed if we are not successful in our efforts to develop and introduce new products and services to retain our existing customers expand our customer base and increase revenues per customer 

as online services and business models grow in popularity and usage and as we continue to grow our online offerings we must continue to innovate and develop features that are demanded by our existing and potential online customers which may require expertise with new technologies and platforms if we are unable to continue developing marketing and commercializing valuable online services we may be unable to attract and retain customers and our revenues could suffer 

in some cases we may expend a significant amount of resources and management attention on products or services that do not ultimately succeed in their markets we have encountered difficulty in launching new products and services in the past for example we discontinued our easy estimator for contractors offering at the end of fiscal 2007 if we misjudge customer needs our new products and services will not succeed and our revenues and earnings will be harmed as we expand our offerings to new customer categories we run the risk of customers shifting from our higher priced and higher margin products to our lower priced or free offerings for instance our quickbooks simple start free edition may attract users that would otherwise have purchased our higher priced more full featured offerings 

interruption or failure of our information technology and communications systems could compromise the availability and security of our online products and services which could damage our reputation and harm our operating results 

as we continue to grow our online services including turbotax online consumer and professional electronic tax filing services quickbooks online web site design and hosting services for small businesses online payroll and banking services quicken online and online commerce web sites we become more dependent on the continuing 

operation and availability of our information technology and communication systems and those of our external service providers any damage to or failure of our systems could result in interruptions in our service which could reduce our revenues and profits cause us to lose customers and damage our brand although we have implemented practices designed to maintain the availability of our online products and services and mitigate the harm of any unplanned interruptions we do not have complete redundancy for all of our systems and our disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities despite our efforts to maintain continuous and reliable server operations we occasionally experience unplanned outages or technical difficulties due to our evolving business needs and real estate planning we are building a new data center in washington state to support our longer term hosting requirements we expect to begin occupying this data center in the second half of fiscal 2009 if we do not execute this transition to the new data center in an effective manner we could experience unplanned service disruptions or unforeseen increases in cost which could harm our operating results and our business we do not maintain realtime backup of all our data and in the event of significant system disruption particularly during peak tax filing season we could experience loss of data or processing capabilities which could cause us to lose customers and could materially harm our reputation and our operating results 

our data centers and our information technology and communications systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters malicious attacks fire power loss telecommunications failures computer viruses computer denial of service attacks or other attempts to harm our systems if hackers were able to circumvent our security measures we could lose proprietary information or personal information or experience significant disruptions in the delivery of our products and services if our systems become unavailable or suffer a security breach we may expend significant resources to address these problems including notification under data privacy regulations and our reputation and operating results could suffer 

we rely on internal systems and external systems maintained by manufacturers distributors and service providers to take and fulfill customer orders handle customer service requests and host certain online activities any interruption or failure of our internal or external systems could prevent us or our service providers from accepting and fulfilling customer orders or cause company and customer data to be unintentionally disclosed our continuing efforts to upgrade and expand our network security and other information systems could be costly and problems with the design or implementation of system enhancements could harm our business and our results of operations 

if we fail to maintain reliable and responsive service levels for our electronic tax offerings or if the irs or other governmental agencies experience difficulties in receiving customer submissions we could lose customers and our revenue and earnings could decrease 

our online tax preparation and filing services are an important and growing part of our tax businesses and must effectively handle extremely heavy customer demand during the peak tax season from january to april we face significant risks and challenges in maintaining these services and maintaining adequate service levels particularly during peak volume service times similarly governmental entities receiving electronic tax filings must also handle large volumes of data and may experience difficulties with their systems which could prevent the receipt of electronic filings if customers are unable to file their returns electronically they may elect to make paper filings this would result in reduced electronic tax return preparation and filing revenues and would harm our reputation and ability to attract and retain customers for example on april 17 2007 our customers experienced significant delays in electronically filing their income tax returns due to an intermittent database problem in our efiling system we refunded approximately 9 million in credit card charges for our consumer electronic filing and online tax preparation services that were made during the time that the delays occurred these refunds did not have a significant impact on our fiscal 2007 financial condition or results of operations however we may experience problems with our online systems and services in the future and any prolonged interruptions in our online tax preparation or electronic filing service at any time during the tax season would result in lost customers additional refunds of customer charges negative publicity and increased operating costs any of which could significantly harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

the nature of our products necessitates timely product launches and if we experience significant product quality problems or delays it will harm our revenue earnings and reputation 

all of our tax products and many of our nontax products have rigid development timetables that increase the risk of errors in our products and the risk of launch delays our tax preparation software product development cycle is particularly challenging due to the need to incorporate unpredictable tax law and tax form changes each year and 

because our customers expect high levels of accuracy and a timely launch of these products to prepare and file their taxes by the tax filing deadline due to the complexity of our products and the condensed development cycles under which we operate our products sometimes contain “bugs” that can unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the software when we encounter problems we may be required to modify our code distribute patches to customers who have already purchased the product and recall or repackage existing product inventory in our distribution channels if we encounter development challenges or discover errors in our products late in our development cycle it may cause us to delay our product launch date any major defects or launch delays could lead to loss of customers and revenue negative publicity customer and employee dissatisfaction reduced retailer shelf space and promotions and increased operating expenses such as inventory replacement costs legal fees or payments resulting from our commitment to reimburse penalties and interest paid by customers due solely to calculation errors in our consumer tax preparation products 

our collection use and retention of personal customer information present business operations and security risks require us to incur expenses and could harm our business 

a number of our businesses collect use and retain large amounts of personal customer information including credit card numbers tax return information bank account numbers and passwords personal and business financial data social security numbers and other payroll information we may also develop new business models that use personal information or data derived from personal information in innovative and novel ways in addition we collect and maintain personal information of our employees in the ordinary course of our business some of this personal customer and employee information is held and some transactions are executed by third parties in addition as many of our products and services are web based the amount of data we store for our users on our servers including personal information has been increasing we and our vendors use commercially available security technologies to protect transactions and personal information we use security and business controls to limit access and use of personal information however a third party may be able to circumvent these security and business measures and errors in the storage use or transmission of personal information could result in a breach of customer or employee privacy or theft of assets which may require notification under applicable data privacy regulations we employ contractors temporary and seasonal employees who may have access to the personal information of customers and employees or who may execute transactions in the normal course of their duties while we conduct necessary and appropriate background checks of these individuals and limit access to systems and data it is possible that one or more of these individuals could circumvent these controls resulting in a security breach the ability to execute transactions and the possession and use of personal information in conducting our business subjects us to legislative and regulatory burdens that could require notification to customers or employees of a security breach restrict our use of personal information and hinder our ability to acquire new customers or market to existing customers we have incurred – and will continue to incur – significant expenses to comply with mandatory privacy and security standards and protocols imposed by law regulation industry standards or contractual obligations 

in the past we have experienced lawsuits and negative publicity relating to privacy issues and we could face similar suits in the future a major breach of our security measures or those of third parties that execute transactions or hold and manage personal information could have serious negative consequences for our businesses including possible fines penalties and damages reduced customer demand for our services harm to our reputation and brands further regulation and oversight by federal or state agencies and loss of our ability to provide financial transaction services or accept and process customer credit card orders or tax returns from time to time we detect or receive notices from customers or public or private agencies that they have detected vulnerabilities in our software or in thirdparty software components that are distributed with our products the existence of vulnerabilities even if they do not result in a security breach can harm customer confidence and require substantial resources to address and we may not be able to discover or remediate such security vulnerabilities before they are exploited although we have sophisticated network and application security internal control measures and physical security procedures to safeguard our systems there can be no assurance that a security breach loss or theft of personal information will not occur which could harm our business customer reputation and results of operations if our business expands to new industry segments that are regulated for privacy and security or to countries outside the us that have more strict data protection laws our compliance requirements and costs will increase 

the growth of our business depends on our ability to adapt to rapid technological change 

the software industry in which we operate is characterized by rapidly changing technology evolving industry standards and frequent new product introductions and enhancements we must continually invest in our software 

architecture and developer tools in order to enhance our current products and develop new products to meet changing customer needs and to attract and retain talented software developers we are currently in the process of updating the software platforms for a number of our product lines including our quickbooks and turbotax products and services completing these upgrades and adapting to other technological developments and new platforms may require considerable time and expense if we experience prolonged delays or unforeseen difficulties in upgrading our software architecture our ability to develop new products and enhancements to our current products would suffer 

our reliance on a limited number of manufacturing and distribution suppliers could harm our business 

we have chosen to outsource the large majority of the manufacturing and distribution for many of our desktop software products to a single third party provider and we use a single vendor to produce and distribute our check and business forms supplies products although our reliance on single suppliers provides us with efficiencies and enhanced bargaining power poor performance by or lack of effective communication with these suppliers can significantly harm our business this risk is amplified by the fact that we carry very little inventory and rely on justintime manufacturing processes in particular the loss of our manufacturing partner for retail would be disruptive to our business and could cause delay in a product launch we seek to mitigate this risk by managing our second tier vendors and maintaining contingency plans if we experience delays during a peak demand period or significant quality issues our business could be significantly harmed 

as our product and service offerings become more complex our revenue streams may become less predictable  

our expanding range of products and services generates more varied revenue streams than our traditional desktop software businesses the accounting policies that apply to these revenue streams are more complex than those that apply to our traditional products and services we expect this trend to continue as we expand our offerings for example as we begin to offer additional features and options as part of multipleelement revenue arrangements we could be required to defer a higher percentage of our product revenue at the time of sale than we do for traditional products this would decrease recognized revenue at the time products are shipped but result in increased recognized revenue in fiscal periods after shipment in addition as we offer more services on a subscription basis including certain online services for small businesses we recognize revenue from those services over the periods in which they are delivered rather than recognizing onetime license fees this could result in significant shifts of revenue from quarter to quarter or from one fiscal year to the next and could make our revenues less predictable 

our revenue and earnings are highly seasonal and our quarterly results fluctuate significantly 

several of our businesses are highly seasonal causing significant quarterly fluctuations in our financial results revenue and operating results are usually strongest during the second and third fiscal quarters ending january 31 and april 30 due to our tax businesses contributing most of their revenue during those quarters and the timing of the release of our small business software products and upgrades we experience lower revenues and significant operating losses in the first and fourth quarters ending october 31 and july 31 for example in the second and third quarters of fiscal 2007 and 2008 we had total net revenue of between 751 million and 13 billion while in the first and fourth quarters of fiscal 2007 and 2008 we had total net revenue of between 351 million and 478 million our financial results can also fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year due to a variety of factors including changes in product sales mix that affect average selling prices product release dates the timing of our discontinuance of support for older product offerings our methods for distributing our products including the shift to a consignment model for some of our desktop products sold through retail distribution channels changes to our bundling strategy including the inclusion of upgrades with certain offerings changes to how we communicate the availability of new functionality in the future and the timing of our delivery of federal and state tax forms any of which can impact the pattern of revenue recognition and the timing of acquisitions divestitures and goodwill and purchased intangible asset impairment charges 

we face a number of risks in our payment processing business that could result in a reduction in our revenue and earnings 

our payment processing service business is subject to several specific risks including the following 

 

 

should any of these risks be realized our business and financial results would suffer 

we face a number of risks associated with our financial institutions business which could harm our revenue and results of operations 

in february 2007 we acquired digital insight a provider of outsourced online banking services to financial institutions this financial institutions business is subject to several risks including the following 

 

because we depend on a small number of larger retailers and distributors changes in these relationships could harm our results of operations 

we sell most of our desktop software products through our retail distribution channel and a relatively small number of larger retailers and distributors generate a significant portion of our sales volume our principal retailers have significant bargaining leverage due to their size and available resources historically some retailers have elected to offer our tax products exclusively but we cannot guarantee that these exclusive relationships will continue in the future any change in principal business terms loss of exclusivity major disruption or termination of a relationship with these resellers could result in a potentially significant decline in our revenues and earnings the sourcing decisions product display locations and promotional activities that retailers undertake can greatly impact the sales of our products changes in our pricing product offerings or features or concerns by retailers about our direct sales efforts could cause retailers or distributors to reduce their efforts to promote our products eliminate any exclusive placements or stop selling our products altogether if any of our retailers or distributors experience financial difficulties we may be unable to collect amounts that we are owed at january 31 2008 in the midst of the 2007 consumer tax season amounts due from our 10 largest retailers and distributors represented approximately 49 of total gross accounts receivable 

increased government regulation of our businesses could harm our operating results 

the tax preparation industry has received increased attention from legislative and regulatory bodies in recent years both because of the continuing focus on free tax preparation and because of the nature of certain services used to process and transfer refunds to taxpayers new legislation regulation or public policy considerations could result in greater oversight of the tax preparation industry restrict the types of products and services that we can offer or otherwise cause us to change the way we operate our tax businesses or offer our tax products and services this in turn could increase our cost of doing business and limit our revenue opportunities 

we are also required to comply with a variety of state revenue agency standards in order to successfully operate our tax preparation and electronic filing services changes in stateimposed requirements by one or more of the states including the required use of specific technologies or technology standards could significantly increase the costs of providing those services to our customers and could prevent us from delivering a quality product to our customers in a timely manner 

our financial institutions business provides services to banks credit unions and other institutions that are subject to extensive and complex federal and state regulation as a result our financial institution customers require that our products and services comply with the regulations applicable to these customers if we are unable to comply with these regulations we could incur significant costs and penalties face litigation or governmental proceedings and lose our ability to sell to these customers any of these adverse events could harm our results of operations and our reputation 

in addition as we seek to grow our business we may expand into more highlyregulated businesses or countries which will require increased investment in compliance and auditing functions or new technologies in order to meet regulatory standards government authorities could adopt other laws rules or regulations that place new burdens or restrictions on our business or determine that our operations are directly subject to existing rules or regulations such as requirements related to data collection use transmission retention and processing which could make our business more costly less efficient or impossible to conduct and could require us to modify our current or future products or services which could harm our operating results 

expansion of our operations in international markets exposes us to operational and compliance risks 

as we continue to grow our business internationally we face increased risk which could harm our business operating results and financial condition we have limited experience with operations outside the us and our ability to manage our business and conduct our operations internationally requires management attention and resources and is subject to a number of risks including difficulties in managing varying foreign operations political or social unrest or economic instability foreign currency restrictions and exchange rate fluctuations higher costs associated with doing business internationally and potentially adverse tax consequences also compliance with complex foreign and us laws and regulations that apply to our international operations increases our cost of doing business in international jurisdictions and could expose us or our employees to fines and penalties 

if we do not respond promptly and effectively to customer service and technical support inquiries we will lose customers and our revenue and earnings will decline 

the effectiveness of our customer service and technical support operations are critical to customer satisfaction and our financial success if we do not respond effectively to service and technical support requests we will lose customers and miss revenue opportunities such as paid service product renewals and new product sales we occasionally experience customer service and technical support problems including longer than expected waiting times for customers when our staffing and systems are inadequate to handle a higherthananticipated volume of requests training and retaining qualified customer service and technical support personnel is particularly challenging due to the expansion of our product offerings and the seasonality of our tax business for example although many of our consumer tax service representatives return each tax season it is challenging to expand the number of representatives from about 110 during offseason months to about 1100 at the peak of the season if we do not adequately train our support representatives our customers will not receive an appropriate level of support we will lose customers and our financial results will suffer 

if we encounter problems with our thirdparty customer service and technical support providers our business and operating results will be harmed 

we outsource a substantial portion of our customer service and technical support activities to domestic and international thirdparty service providers including service providers in india and we expect to continue to rely heavily on third parties in the future this strategy provides us with lower operating costs and greater flexibility but also presents risks to our business including the following 

 

we are exposed to risks associated with credit card and payment fraud and with credit card processing 

many of our customers use credit cards or automated payment systems to pay for our products and services we have suffered losses and may continue to suffer losses as a result of orders placed with fraudulent credit card or other payment data for example under current credit card practices we may be liable for fraudulent credit card transactions if we do not obtain a cardholder’s signature a frequent practice in internet sales we employ technology solutions to help us detect fraudulent transactions however the failure to detect or control payment fraud could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

we are subject to payment card association operating rules and certification requirements as in effect from time to time failure to comply with these rules or requirements may subject us to fines and higher transaction fees or cause us to lose our ability to accept credit card payments from our customers resulting in harm to our business and results of operations 

if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights competitors may exploit our innovations which could weaken our competitive position and reduce our revenue and earnings 

our success depends upon our proprietary technology we rely on a combination of copyright trade secret trademark patent confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights as part of our confidentiality procedures we generally enter into nondisclosure agreements with our 

employees contractors distributors and corporate partners and into license agreements with respect to our software documentation and other proprietary information the creation and protection of our proprietary rights are expensive and may require us to engage in costly and distracting litigation despite these precautions third parties could copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology without authorization because we outsource significant aspects of our product development manufacturing and distribution we are at risk that confidential portions of our intellectual property could become public by lapses in security by our contractors we have licensed in the past and expect to license in the future certain of our proprietary rights such as trademarks or copyrighted material to others these licensees may take actions that diminish the value of our proprietary rights or harm our reputation it is also possible that other companies could successfully challenge the validity or scope of our patents and that our patent portfolio which is relatively small may not provide us with adequate protection ultimately our attempts to secure legal protection for our proprietary rights may not be adequate and our competitors could independently develop similar technologies duplicate our products or design around patents and other intellectual property rights if our intellectual property protection proves inadequate we could lose our competitive advantage and our financial results will suffer 

third parties claiming that we infringe their proprietary rights could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and prevent us from selling our products 

from time to time we have received claims that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of others as the number of products in the software industry increases and the functionality of these products further overlap and as we acquire technology through acquisitions or licenses we may become increasingly subject to infringement claims including patent copyright and trademark infringement claims we have received allegations of patent infringement claims in the past and may receive more claims in the future based on allegations that our products infringe upon patents held by third parties some of these claims are the subject of pending litigation against us and against some of our oem customers these claims may involve patent holding companies or other adverse patent owners who have no relevant product revenues of their own and against whom our own patents may provide little or no deterrence the ultimate outcome of any allegation is uncertain and regardless of outcome any such claim with or without merit could be time consuming to defend result in costly litigation divert management’s time and attention from our business require us to stop selling to delay shipping or to redesign our products or require us to pay monetary damages for royalty or licensing arrangements or to satisfy indemnification obligations that we have with some of our customers our failure to obtain necessary license or other rights or litigation arising out of intellectual property claims could adversely affect our business 

we expect copying and misuse of our intellectual property to be a persistent problem causing lost revenue and increased expenses 

our intellectual property rights are among our most valuable assets policing unauthorized use and copying of our products is difficult expensive and time consuming current us laws that prohibit copying give us only limited practical protection from software piracy and the laws of many other countries provide very little protection we may not be able to prevent misappropriation of our technology for example we frequently encounter unauthorized copies of our software being sold through online auction sites and other online marketplaces in addition efforts to protect our intellectual property may be misunderstood and perceived negatively by our customers although we continue to evaluate and put in place technology solutions to attempt to lessen the impact of piracy and we continue to increase our civil and criminal enforcement efforts we expect piracy to be a persistent problem that results in lost revenues and increased expenses 

although we are unable to quantify the extent of piracy of our software products software piracy may depress our net revenues we engage in efforts to educate consumers on the benefits of licensing genuine products and to educate lawmakers on the advantages of a business climate where intellectual property rights are protected and we cooperate with the software  information industry association in their efforts to combat piracy however these efforts may not fully combat the effect of piracy of our products 

we do not own all of the software other technologies and content used in our products and services 

many of our products include intellectual property owned by third parties we believe we have all of the necessary licenses from third parties to use and distribute third party technology and content that we do not own that is used in our current products and services from time to time we may be required to renegotiate with these third parties – or 

negotiate with new third parties – to include their technology or content in our existing products in new versions of our existing products or in wholly new products we may not be able to negotiate or renegotiate licenses on reasonable terms or at all these third parties may from time to time receive claims that they have infringed the intellectual property rights of others including patent and copyright infringement claims which may affect our ability to continue licensing their software if we are unable to obtain the rights necessary to use or continue to use thirdparty technology or content in our products and services we may not be able to sell the affected products which would in turn harm our revenue and operating results 

certain of our offerings include thirdparty software that is licensed under socalled “open source” licenses some of which may include a requirement that under certain circumstances we make available or grant licenses to any modifications or derivative works we create based upon the open source software although we have established internal review and approval processes to mitigate these risks we cannot be sure that all open source software is submitted for approval prior to use in our products many of the risks associated with usage of open source cannot be eliminated and could if not properly addressed harm our business 

our acquisition and divestiture activities could disrupt our ongoing business may involve increased expenses and may present risks not contemplated at the time of the transactions 

we have acquired and may continue to acquire companies products and technologies that complement our strategic direction for example in february 2007 we acquired digital insight for total consideration of approximately 134 billion including the value of assumed vested options acquisitions involve significant risks and uncertainties including 

 

acquisitions and divestitures are inherently risky we can not be certain that our previous pending or future transactions will be successful and will not materially adversely affect the conduct operating results or financial condition of our business many transactions are subject to closing conditions which may not be satisfied and transactions may not be successfully completed even after their public announcement in addition integrating acquired businesses has been and will continue to be complex time consuming and expensive and can impact the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting we have generally paid cash for our recent acquisitions these transactions may involve further use of our cash resources the issuance of equity or debt securities the incurrence of other forms of debt the amortization of expenses related to intangible assets or potential future impairment charges related to goodwill that we record on our balance sheet which will be subject to annual testing in the future any of which could harm our financial condition and results of operations in particular we allocated a portion of the purchase price for digital insight to goodwill which could be subject to potential future impairment charges and we also allocated a portion of the purchase price to identified intangible assets which we expect to amortize over a period of three to five years further we issued 1 billion in senior unsecured notes to fund a portion of the purchase price of digital insight and to fund our operations the use of debt to fund acquisitions or for other purposes significantly increases our interest expense and leverage if we issue equity securities as consideration in an acquisition current shareholders’ percentage ownership and earnings per share may be diluted 

we have issued 1 billion in a debt offering and may incur other debt in the future which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

in fiscal 2007 we issued 1 billion in senior unsecured notes we have also entered into a 500 million fiveyear revolving credit facility although we have no current plans to request any advances under this credit facility we may use the proceeds of any future borrowing for general corporate purposes or for future acquisitions or expansion of our business 

this debt may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition by among other things 

 

our current revolving credit facility imposes restrictions on us including restrictions on our ability to create liens on our assets and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur indebtedness and require us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios our ability to comply with these ratios may be affected by events beyond our control in addition our longterm nonconvertible debt includes covenants that may adversely affect our ability to incur certain liens or engage in certain types of sale and leaseback transactions if we breach any of the covenants under our longterm debt or our revolving credit facility and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders then subject to applicable cure periods any outstanding indebtedness could be declared immediately due and payable 

in addition changes by any rating agency to our credit rating can negatively impact the value and liquidity of both our debt and equity securities if our credit ratings are downgraded or other negative action is taken the interest rate payable by us under our revolving credit facility would increase in addition any downgrades in our credit ratings could affect our ability to obtain additional financing in the future and may affect the terms of any such financing 

we are subject to risks associated with information disseminated through our services 

the law relating to the liability of online services companies for information carried on or disseminated through their services is often unsettled claims could be made against online services companies under both us and foreign law for defamation libel invasion of privacy negligence copyright or trademark infringement or other theories based on the nature and content of the materials disseminated through their services certain of our services feature a live community which includes input from users in response to questions from other users although all such feedback is generated by users and not by us claims of defamation or other injury could be made against us for content posted in the live community any costs incurred as a result of this potential liability could harm our business 

if actual product returns exceed returns reserves our financial results would be harmed 

we ship more desktop software products to our distributors and retailers than we expect them to sell in order to reduce the risk that distributors or retailers will run out of products this is particularly true for our consumer tax products which have a short selling season and for which returns occur primarily in our fiscal third and fourth quarters like many software companies that sell their products through distributors and retailers we have historically accepted significant product returns we establish reserves against revenue for product returns in our financial statements based on estimated returns and we closely monitor product sales and inventory in the retail channel in an effort to maintain adequate reserves in the past returns have not differed significantly from these reserves however if we experience actual returns that significantly exceed reserves it would result in lower net revenue for example if we had increased our fiscal 2008 returns reserves by 1 of nonconsignment sales to retailers for quickbooks turbotax and quicken our total net revenue for fiscal 2008 would have been approximately 30 million lower in addition our policy of recognizing revenue from distributors and retailers upon delivery of product for nonconsignment sales is predicated upon our ability to reasonably estimate returns if we do not continue to demonstrate our ability to estimate returns then our revenue recognition policy for these types of sales may no longer be appropriate 

acquisitionrelated costs and impairment charges can cause significant fluctuation in our net income 

our acquisitions have resulted in significant expenses including amortization and impairment of purchased intangible assets charges for inprocess research and development and impairment of goodwill total acquisitionrelated costs in the categories identified above were approximately 92 million in fiscal 2008 51 million in fiscal 2007 and 18 million in fiscal 2006 although under current accounting rules goodwill is no longer amortized we may incur impairment charges related to the goodwill already recorded and to goodwill arising out of future acquisitions we test the impairment of goodwill annually in our fourth fiscal quarter or more frequently if indicators of impairment arise the timing of the formal annual test may result in charges to our statement of operations in our fourth fiscal quarter that could not have been reasonably foreseen in prior periods at july 31 2008 we had 17 billion in goodwill and 273 million in net purchased intangible assets on our balance sheet both of which could be subject to impairment charges in the future new acquisitions and any impairment of the value of purchased assets could have a significant negative impact on our future operating results 

our investments in auction rate securities are subject to risks that may cause losses and affect the liquidity of these investments 

at july 31 2008 we held approximately 285 million in municipal auction rate securities that were valued at par and classified as longterm assets due to a decrease in liquidity in the global credit markets in february 2008 auctions began failing for the municipal auction rate securities we held regularly scheduled auctions for these securities have generally continued to fail since that time we will not be able to liquidate these investments and realize their full carrying value unless successful auctions occur a buyer is found outside of the auction process the issuer calls the security the issuer repays principal over time from cash flows prior to final maturity or the security matures according to contractual terms ranging from one to 39 years we believe the fair values of the municipal auction rate securities we hold are substantially equivalent to their par values however if the issuers of these securities are unable to call the securities or successfully close future auctions and their credit ratings are lowered we may be required to record future impairment charges related to these investments which would harm our results of operations if we are unable to find alternate means to liquidate these investments we may not realize the value of the investments until the final maturity of the underlying securities 

if we fail to operate our payroll business effectively our revenue and earnings will be harmed 

our payroll business handles a significant amount of dollar and transaction volume due to the size and volume of transactions that we handle effective processing systems and controls are essential to ensure that transactions are handled appropriately despite our efforts it is possible that we may make errors or that funds may be misappropriated in addition to any direct damages and fines that any such problems would create which could be substantial the loss of customer confidence in our accuracy and controls would seriously harm our business the systems supporting our payroll business are comprised of multiple technology platforms that are difficult to scale we must constantly continue to upgrade our systems and processes to ensure that we process customer data in an accurate reliable and timely manner these upgrades must also meet the various regulatory requirements and deadlines associated with employerrelated payroll activities any failure of our systems or processes in critical switchover times such as in january when many businesses elect to change payroll service providers would be detrimental to our business if we failed to timely deliver any of our payroll products it could cause our current and prospective customers to choose a competitor’s product for that year’s payroll and not to purchase intuit products in the future if these efforts are not successful our revenue growth and profitability will decline 

interest income attributable to payroll customer deposits may fluctuate or be eliminated causing our revenue and earnings to decline 

we currently record revenue from interest earned on customer deposits that we hold pending payment of funds to taxing authorities or to customers’ employees if interest rates decline or there are regulatory changes that diminish the amount of time that we are required or permitted to hold such funds our interest revenue will decline 

we may be unable to attract and retain key personnel 

much of our future success depends on the continued service and availability of skilled personnel including members of our executive team and those in technical marketing and staff positions experienced personnel in the 

software and services industries are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense especially in the san francisco bay area and san diego california where the majority of our employees are located although we strive to be an employer of choice we may not be able to continue to successfully attract and retain key personnel which would cause our business to suffer 

we are frequently a party to litigation that is costly to defend and consumes the time of our management 

due to our financial position and the large number of customers that we serve we are often forced to defend litigation defending litigation consumes the time of our management and is expensive for intuit even though we often seek insurance coverage for litigation defense costs there is no assurance that our defense costs which can be substantial will be covered in all cases in addition by its nature litigation is unpredictable and we may not prevail even in cases where we strongly believe a plaintiff’s case has no valid claims if we do not prevail in litigation we may be required to pay substantial monetary damages or alter our business operations regardless of the outcome litigation is expensive and consumes the time of our management and may ultimately reduce our income 

unanticipated changes in our tax rates could affect our future financial results 

our future effective tax rates could be favorably or unfavorably affected by unanticipated changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or by changes in tax laws or their interpretation in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls we may not be able to detect fraud or report our financial results accurately which could harm our business and the trading price of our common stock 

we periodically assess our system of internal controls and the internal controls of service providers upon which we rely to review their effectiveness and identify potential areas of improvement in addition from time to time we acquire businesses many of which have limited infrastructure and systems of internal controls performing assessments of internal controls implementing necessary changes and maintaining an effective controls environment is expensive and requires considerable management attention internal control systems are designed in part upon assumptions about the likelihood of future events and all such systems however well designed and operated can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance that the objectives of the system are met because of the inherent limitations of control systems there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions if we fail to implement and maintain an effective system of internal controls or prevent fraud we could suffer losses could be subject to costly litigation investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information and our brand and operating results could be harmed 

we and our independent registered public accounting firm must certify the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting annually identification of material weaknesses in internal controls over financial reporting could harm our business 

general economic conditions may affect our revenue and harm our business 

economic growth in the us continued to slow in the last quarter of fiscal year 2008 if economic growth in the us continues to slow many customers may delay or reduce technology purchases this could result in reductions in sales of our products slower adoption of new technologies and upgrades to existing technologies and increased price competition weakness in the enduser market could negatively affect the cash flow of our distributors and resellers who could in turn delay paying their obligations to us which could increase our credit risk exposure and cause delays in our recognition of revenue or future sales to these customers if economic or other factors cause financial institutions to fail we could lose current or potential customers and our revenues could suffer any of these events would likely harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

business interruptions could adversely affect our future operating results 

several of our major business operations are subject to interruption by earthquake fire power shortages terrorist attacks and other hostile acts and other events beyond our control our global operations are also dependent on political stability in regions with emerging economies and less predictable regulation of commerce the majority of our research and development activities our corporate headquarters our principal information technology systems and other critical business operations are located near major seismic faults we do not carry earthquake insurance for direct quakerelated losses while we maintain disaster recovery facilities for key data centers that support the information systems networks and databases that are necessary to operate our business we do not have disaster recovery facilities for all of our data centers our operating results and financial condition could be materially harmed in the event of a major earthquake or other natural or manmade disaster or disruption

 item 3 legal proceedings 

intuit is subject to certain routine legal proceedings as well as demands claims and threatened litigation that arise in the normal course of our business including assertions that we may be infringing patents or other intellectual property rights of others we currently believe that the ultimate amount of liability if any for any pending claims of any type either alone or combined will not materially affect our financial position results of operations or cash flows the ultimate outcome of any litigation is uncertain and regardless of outcome litigation can have an adverse impact on intuit because of defense costs negative publicity diversion of management resources and other factors our failure to obtain necessary license or other rights or litigation arising out of intellectual property claims could adversely affect our business

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda includes the following sections 

 

you should note that this mda discussion contains forwardlooking statements that involve risks and uncertainties please see the section entitled “forwardlooking statements and risk factors” at the beginning of item 1a for important information to consider when evaluating such statements 

you should read this mda in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes in item 8 in february 2007 we completed the acquisition of digital insight corporation digital insight for a total purchase price of approximately 134 billion in december 2007 we acquired homestead technologies inc homestead for total consideration of approximately 170 million and in february 2008 we acquired electronic clearing house inc echo for a total purchase price of approximately 131 million accordingly we have included the results of operations for these companies in our consolidated results of operations from their respective dates of acquisition during fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2008 we transitioned certain outsourced payroll customers in connection with a sale of assets to automatic data processing inc adp we have also reclassified our financial statements for all periods presented to reflect our intuit information technology solutions and intuit distribution management solutions businesses as discontinued operations see “results of operations  dispositions and discontinued operations” later in this item 7 for more information unless otherwise noted the following discussion pertains only to our continuing operations 

executive overview 

this overview provides a high level discussion of our operating results and some of the trends that affect our business we believe that an understanding of these trends is important in order to understand our financial results for fiscal 2008 as well as our future prospects this summary is not intended to be exhaustive nor is it intended to be a substitute for the detailed discussion and analysis provided elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

overview of financial results 

total net revenue for fiscal 2008 was 31 billion up 15 compared with fiscal 2007 the fiscal 2008 revenue increase was driven by our acquisition of digital insight and revenue growth in our consumer tax segment excluding the impact of our acquisitions of digital insight homestead and echo and the transition of certain outsourced payroll customers in connection with a sale of assets to adp we estimate that total net revenue for fiscal 2008 would have increased 11 compared with fiscal 2007 

operating income from continuing operations of 6508 million for fiscal 2008 increased 2 compared with 6376 million for fiscal 2007 fiscal 2008 revenue growth was almost completely offset by higher costs of revenue and higher operating expenses higher costs and expenses in fiscal 2008 reflect our acquisition of digital insight which has a higher cost structure than our other businesses higher costs of revenue associated with revenue growth in our other segments increased investment in research and development for new and existing offerings and increases in advertising and other marketing spending to support our consumer tax offerings in addition sharebased compensation expense increased approximately 37 million in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 and we recorded a 23 million restructuring charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 in connection with a reallocation of resources to key growth businesses the effects of these factors are described in more detail under “cost of revenue” and “operating expenses” below 

net income from continuing operations of 4508 million for fiscal 2008 increased 2 compared with 4435 million for fiscal 2007 and diluted net income per share from continuing operations of 133 for fiscal 2008 increased 6 compared with 125 for fiscal 2007 in fiscal 2008 we incurred interest expense of 523 million compared with 271 million in fiscal 2007 interest expense for both periods related primarily to the senior notes we issued in march 2007 we also recorded a pretax gain of 516 million on the sale of certain outsourced payroll assets to adp in fiscal 2008 compared with 317 million in fiscal 2007 our effective tax rates for fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007 were approximately 35 and 36 average shares outstanding declined during fiscal 2008 as a result of repurchases of 272 million shares of common stock under our stock repurchase programs partially offset by the issuance of 106 million shares in connection with our employee stock plans 

in august 2007 we sold our intuit distribution management solutions idms business for approximately 100 million in cash and recorded a net gain on disposal of 275 million idms was part of our other businesses segment we have accounted for idms as a discontinued operation and segregated the operating results of idms from continuing operations for all periods presented 

in december 2007 we acquired homestead technologies inc for total consideration of approximately 170 million on a fully diluted basis homestead is a provider of web site design and hosting services to small businesses and became part of our quickbooks segment 

in february 2008 we acquired electronic clearing house inc for a total purchase price of approximately 131 million in cash echo is a provider of electronic payment processing services to small businesses and became part of our payroll and payments segment 

during the third quarter of fiscal 2008 we completed the transition of certain outsourced payroll customers in connection with a sale of assets to adp see “ nonoperating income and expenses  dispositions and discontinued operations” later in this item 7 for more information 

we ended fiscal 2008 with cash cash equivalents and investments totaling 8278 million a decrease of 4759 million from july 31 2007 this decrease was due in part to the reclassification of 2853 million in municipal auction rate securities to longterm investments during fiscal 2008 see “liquidity and capital resources — auction rate securities” later in this item 7 for more information in fiscal 2008 we generated 8302 million in cash from continuing operations 3479 million from sales of investments 1947 million from the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans and 971 million from the sale of our idms business during the same period we used 800 million in cash for the repurchase of shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs 3061 million for capital expenditures and 2645 million for acquisitions of businesses including homestead and echo at july 31 2008 we had authorization from our board to expend up to 600 million for stock repurchases through may 15 2011 

seasonality 

our quickbooks consumer tax and accounting professionals businesses are highly seasonal some of our other offerings are also seasonal but to a lesser extent revenue from our quickbooks software products tends to be highest during our second and third fiscal quarters although the timing of new product releases or changes in our offerings can materially shift revenue between quarters sales of income tax preparation products and services are heavily concentrated in the period from november through april in our consumer tax business a greater proportion of our revenue has been occurring later in this seasonal period due in part to the growth in sales of turbotax online for which revenue is recognized upon printing or electronic filing of a tax return the seasonality of our consumer tax and accounting professionals revenue is also affected by the timing of the availability of tax forms from taxing agencies and the ability of those agencies to receive electronic tax return submissions delays in the availability of tax forms or the ability of taxing agencies to receive submissions can cause revenue to shift from our second fiscal quarter to our third fiscal quarter these seasonal patterns mean that our total net revenue is usually highest during our second quarter ending january 31 and third quarter ending april 30 we typically report losses in our first quarter ending october 31 and fourth quarter ending july 31 when revenue from our tax businesses is minimal while operating expenses continue at relatively consistent levels we believe the seasonality of our revenue is likely to continue in the future 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

in preparing our financial statements we make estimates assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on our net revenue operating income or loss and net income or loss as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our balance sheet we believe that the estimates assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies senior management has reviewed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and their disclosure in this annual report on form 10k with the audit committee of our board of directors 

revenue recognition 

we derive revenue from the sale of packaged software products license fees software subscriptions product support hosting services payroll services merchant services professional services transaction fees and multiple element arrangements that may include any combination of these items we follow the appropriate revenue recognition rules for each type of revenue for additional information see “revenue recognition” in note 1 to the financial statements in item 8 we generally recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists we have delivered the product or performed the service the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable however determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report for example for multiple element arrangements we must make assumptions and judgments in order to allocate the total price among the various elements we must deliver to determine whether undelivered services are essential to the functionality of the delivered products and services to determine whether vendorspecific evidence of fair value exists for each undelivered element and to determine whether and when each element has been delivered if we were to change any of these assumptions or judgments it could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period amounts for fees collected or invoiced and due relating to arrangements where revenue cannot be recognized are reflected on our balance sheet as deferred revenue and recognized when the applicable revenue recognition criteria are satisfied 

in connection with the sale of certain products we provide a limited amount of free technical support assistance to customers we do not defer the recognition of any revenue associated with sales of these products since the cost of providing this free technical support is insignificant the technical support is generally provided within one year after the associated revenue is recognized and free product enhancements are minimal and infrequent we accrue the estimated cost of providing this free support upon product shipment 

return and rebate reserves 

as part of our revenue recognition policy we estimate future product returns and rebate payments and establish reserves against revenue at the time of sale based on these estimates our return policy allows distributors and retailers subject to contractual limitations to return purchased products product returns by distributors and retailers relate primarily to the return of excess and obsolete products in determining our product returns reserves we consider the volume and price mix of products in the retail channel historical return rates for prior releases of the product trends in retailer inventory and economic trends that might impact customer demand for our products including the competitive environment and the timing of new releases of our products we fully reserve for excess and obsolete products in the distribution channels 

our rebate reserves include distributor and retailer sales incentive rebates and enduser rebates our estimated reserves for distributor and retailer incentive rebates are based on distributors’ and retailers’ actual performance against the terms and conditions of rebate programs which we typically establish annually our reserves for enduser rebates are estimated based on the terms and conditions of the specific promotional rebate program actual sales during the promotion and historical redemption trends by product and by type of promotional program 

in the past actual returns and rebates have not differed significantly from the reserves that we have established however actual returns and rebates in any future period are inherently uncertain if we were to change our assumptions and estimates our revenue reserves would change which would impact the net revenue we report if actual returns and rebates are significantly greater than the reserves we have established the actual results would decrease our future reported revenue conversely if actual returns and rebates are significantly less than our 

reserves this would increase our future reported revenue for example if we had increased our fiscal 2008 returns reserves by 1 of nonconsignment sales to retailers for quickbooks turbotax and quicken our total net revenue for fiscal 2008 would have been 30 million lower 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

we make ongoing assumptions relating to the collectibility of our accounts receivable the accounts receivable amount on our balance sheet includes a reserve for accounts that might not be paid in determining the amount of the reserve we consider our historical level of credit losses we also make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations and we assess current economic trends that might impact the level of credit losses in the future our reserves have generally been adequate to cover our actual credit losses however since we cannot reliably predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers we cannot guarantee that our reserves will continue to be adequate if actual credit losses are significantly greater than the reserve we have established that would increase our general and administrative expenses and reduce our reported net income conversely if actual credit losses are significantly less than our reserve this would eventually decrease our general and administrative expenses and increase our reported net income

under the purchase method of accounting we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values we record the excess of purchase price over the aggregate fair values as goodwill we engage thirdparty appraisal firms to assist us in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed these valuations require us to make significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets critical estimates in valuing purchased technology customer lists and other identifiable intangible assets include future cash flows that we expect to generate from the acquired assets if the subsequent actual results and updated projections of the underlying business activity change compared with the assumptions and projections used to develop these values we could experience impairment charges in addition we have estimated the economic lives of certain acquired assets and these lives are used to calculate depreciation and amortization expense if our estimates of the economic lives change depreciation or amortization expenses could be accelerated or slowed 

goodwill purchased intangible assets and other longlived assets — impairment assessments 

we make judgments about the recoverability of purchased intangible assets and other longlived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an otherthantemporary impairment in the remaining value of the assets recorded on our balance sheet may exist we test the impairment of goodwill annually in our fourth fiscal quarter or more frequently if indicators of impairment arise the timing of the formal annual test may result in charges to our statement of operations in our fourth fiscal quarter that could not have been reasonably foreseen in prior periods in order to estimate the fair value of longlived assets we typically make various assumptions about the future prospects for the business that the asset relates to consider market factors specific to that business and estimate future cash flows to be generated by that business we evaluate cash flows at the lowest operating level and the number of reporting units that we have identified may make impairment more probable than it would be at a company with fewer reporting units and integrated operations following acquisitions based on these assumptions and estimates we determine whether we need to record an impairment charge to reduce the value of the asset stated on our balance sheet to reflect its estimated fair value assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives are complex and often subjective they can be affected by a variety of factors including external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate different assumptions and estimates could materially impact our reported financial results more conservative estimates of the anticipated future benefits from these businesses could result in impairment charges which would decrease net income and result in lower asset values on our balance sheet conversely less conservative estimates could result in smaller or no impairment charges higher net income and higher asset values at july 31 2008 we had 17 billion in goodwill and 2731 million in net purchased intangible assets on our balance sheet 

accounting for sharebased compensation plans 

we account for sharebased compensation using the fair value recognition provisions of sfas 123r “sharebased payment” at july 31 2008 there was 2215 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested sharebased compensation arrangements granted under all equity compensation plans which we will amortize to expense in the future total unrecognized compensation cost will be adjusted for future changes in estimated forfeitures we expect to recognize that cost over a weighted average vesting period of 22 years 

we use a lattice binomial model and the assumptions shown in note 12 to the financial statements in item 8 to estimate the fair value of stock options granted we estimate the expected term of options granted based on implied exercise patterns using a binomial model we estimate the volatility of our common stock at the date of grant based on the implied volatility of publicly traded oneyear and twoyear options on our common stock consistent with sfas 123r and securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 107 our decision to use implied volatility was based upon the availability of actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility we base the riskfree interest rate that we use in our option valuation model on the implied yield in effect at the time of option grant on constant maturity us treasury issues with equivalent remaining terms we have never paid any cash dividends on our common stock and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future consequently we use an expected dividend yield of zero in our option valuation model in accordance with sfas 123r we estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates we use historical data to estimate prevesting option forfeitures and record sharebased compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest we amortize the fair value of options on a straightline basis over the requisite service periods of the awards which are generally the vesting periods we may elect to use different assumptions under our option valuation model in the future which could materially affect our net income or loss and net income or loss per share we value restricted stock units using the intrinsic value method we amortize the value of restricted stock units on a straightline basis over the restriction period 

legal contingencies 

we are subject to certain legal proceedings as well as demands claims and threatened litigation that arise in the normal course of our business we review the status of each significant matter quarterly and assess our potential financial exposure if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated we record a liability and an expense for the estimated loss significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination of whether an exposure is reasonably estimable our accruals are based on the best information available at the time as additional information becomes available we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates potential legal liabilities and the revision of estimates of potential legal liabilities could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 

income taxes — estimates of effective tax rates deferred taxes and valuation allowance 

when we prepare our financial statements we estimate our income taxes based on the various jurisdictions where we conduct business significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax rules and the potential for future adjustment of our uncertain tax positions by the internal revenue service or other taxing jurisdiction we estimate our current tax liability and assess temporary differences that result from differing treatments of certain items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which we show on our balance sheet we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized to the extent we believe that realization is not likely we establish a valuation allowance when we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in an accounting period we record a corresponding tax expense in our statement of operations 

our net deferred tax asset at july 31 2008 was 1542 million and we had no valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets at that date while we have considered future taxable income in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we could in the future be required to record a valuation allowance to take into account deferred tax assets 

that we may be unable to realize an increase in a valuation allowance would have an adverse impact which could be material on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which we record the increase 

we adopted financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation fin no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes—an interpretation of fasb statement no 109” on august 1 2007 see note 11 to the financial statements in item 8 as a result of our adoption of fin 48 we recognize and measure benefits for uncertain tax positions accounted for in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 109 “accounting for income taxes” using a twostep approach the first step is to evaluate the tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon audit including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes for tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely of being realized upon settlement significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions we evaluate our uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis our evaluations are based upon a number of factors including changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law correspondence with tax authorities during the course of audits and effective settlement of audit issues changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in material increases or decreases in our income tax expense in the period in which we make the change which could have a material impact on our effective tax rate and operating results 

results of operations 

financial overview 

 

total net revenue increased 3981 million or 15 in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 total net revenue was higher in fiscal 2008 due to our february 2007 acquisition of digital insight to revenue growth in our consumer tax segment and to a lesser extent to revenue growth in our quickbooks segment and our payroll and payments segment revenue from our financial institutions segment which includes digital insight was 2986 million in fiscal 2008 compared with 1504 million in fiscal 2007 consumer tax revenue increased 1165 million or 14 in fiscal 2008 due to growth in turbotax online units revenue in our quickbooks segment was up 356 million or 6 in fiscal 2008 and payroll and payments revenue increased 441 million or 9 compared with fiscal 2007 payroll and payments segment revenue for fiscal 2008 increased 14 when adjusted for our acquisition of echo and the transition of certain outsourced payroll customers in connection with a sale of assets to adp see “total net revenue by business segment” below for more information 

higher revenue in fiscal 2008 was almost completely offset by higher costs and expenses including those of digital insight which are relatively higher as a percentage of revenue than the costs and expenses for our other businesses in addition sharebased compensation expense increased approximately 37 million in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 and we recorded a 23 million restructuring charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 in connection with a reallocation of resources to key growth businesses including digital insight sharebased compensation expense and these restructuring charges increases in costs and expenses for fiscal 2008 were approximately 90 million for cost of revenue approximately 133 million for product development expenses approximately 117 million for selling and marketing expenses and approximately 41 million for the amortization of purchased intangible assets and acquisitionrelated charges see “cost of revenue” and “operating expenses” below for more information

total net revenue by business segment 

the table below and the discussion of total net revenue that follows it are organized in accordance with our six reportable business segments see note 8 to the financial statements in item 8 for descriptions of product revenue and service and other revenue for each segment 

we have reclassified segment results for all periods presented to reflect changes that align our product groups more closely with the customers they serve we transferred quickbooks premier accountant edition and proadvisor program product revenue from our quickbooks segment to our professional tax segment and renamed that segment accounting professionals revenue from these products was 315 million in fiscal 2008 225 million in fiscal 2007 and 200 million in fiscal 2006 we also transferred quickbase service revenue from our other businesses segment to our quickbooks segment quickbase revenue was 156 million in fiscal 2008 105 million in fiscal 2007 and 71 million in fiscal 2006 

 

quickbooks 

fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007  quickbooks segment total net revenue increased 356 million or 6 in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 excluding about 15 million in revenue from homestead which we acquired in december 2007 quickbooks segment total net revenue increased 4 in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 total quickbooks software unit sales including activations of our free simple start offering were up slightly in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 revenue growth in fiscal 2008 was driven by a 14 increase in quickbooks 

online subscribers a 22 increase in the number of active quickbooks enterprise solutions customers and 8 growth in revenue from secondary products and services sold in conjunction with quickbooks software units 

fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006  quickbooks segment total net revenue increased 602 million or 11 in fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006 total quickbooks software unit sales were 10 higher in fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006 due in part to new promotions including our firstever quickbooks television advertisements revenue growth in fiscal 2007 was also driven by favorable product mix with quickbooks premier units increasing 25 compared with fiscal 2006 

payroll and payments 

fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 payroll and payments total net revenue increased 441 million or 9 in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 in our payments business revenue increased 33 in fiscal 2008 due to 18 growth in our core merchant services customer base and about 16 million in revenue from echo which we acquired in february 2008 payroll revenue decreased 3 in fiscal 2008 as we completed the transition of portions of our complete payroll and premier payroll services customer base in connection with a sale of assets to adp we estimate that revenue growth in our payroll and payments segment in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 would have been approximately 14 when adjusted for the impact of our acquisition of echo and the sale of those payroll customers 

fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006 payroll and payments total net revenue increased 546 million or 12 in fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006 in our payments business revenue increased 36 in fiscal 2007 due to 22 growth in the customer base and 9 higher transaction volume per customer merchant services revenue slowed in fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006 due to new customer acquisition remaining relatively constant on a larger customer base payroll revenue grew 3 in fiscal 2007 due to 4 growth in the customer base and to a lesser extent to favorable product mix that resulted in higher revenue per customer we estimate that revenue growth in our payroll and payments segment in fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006 would have been approximately 16 when adjusted for the impact of the sale of certain payroll customers to adp 

consumer tax 

fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 consumer tax total net revenue increased 1165 million or 14 in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 the fiscal 2008 revenue increase was due to 17 growth in total federal turbotax units which was driven by 37 growth in turbotax online units we believe that the continuing trend among individual taxpayers toward the use of software rather than manual methods to prepare their own income tax returns will continue to be important to the growth of our consumer tax business 

fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006 consumer tax total net revenue increased 1068 million or 15 in fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006 due to 16 growth in federal turbotax online units and to price increases consumer tax net revenue for fiscal 2007 included the impact of approximately 9 million in refunds to customers who experienced delays in electronically preparing or filing their income tax returns on april 17 2007

fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 accounting professionals total net revenue increased 125 million or 4 in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 we discontinued our proseries express product line in fiscal 2008 which we estimate resulted in a loss of five percentage points of growth for the accounting professionals segment in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 

fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006 accounting professionals total net revenue increased 213 million or 7 in fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006 due to addon product penetration and price increases 

financial institutions 

fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 financial institutions total net revenue increased 1482 million to 2986 million in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 due mainly to revenue from digital insight which we acquired in february 2007 in fiscal 2008 internet banking end users grew 10 and billpay end users grew 16 

fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006 financial institutions total net revenue increased 1260 million to 1504 million in fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006 due almost entirely to our february 2007 acquisition of digital insight

cost of revenue 

 

our cost of revenue has three components 1 cost of product revenue which includes the direct costs of manufacturing and shipping our software products 2 cost of service and other revenue which reflects direct costs associated with providing services including data center costs related to delivering internetbased services and costs associated with revenue sharing and online transactions revenue and 3 amortization of purchased intangible assets which represents the cost of amortizing over their useful lives developed technologies that we have obtained through acquisitions 

fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 cost of product revenue as a percentage of product revenue decreased to 10 in fiscal 2008 from 12 in fiscal 2007 due to cost efficiencies achieved for our quickbooks 2008 and consumer tax product lines cost of service and other revenue as a percentage of service and other revenue increased slightly to 26 in fiscal 2008 from 25 in fiscal 2007 the impact of our acquisition of digital insight which has relatively higher costs of service revenue was partially offset by the impact of 1056 million growth in revenue from turbotax online and electronic tax filing services which have relatively lower costs of service revenue compared with our other service offerings amortization of purchased intangible assets increased in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 due primarily to the amortization of digital insight purchased intangible assets which we acquired in february 2007

including digital insight homestead echo sharebased compensation expense and the restructuring charge about half of the increase in total operating expenses in dollars for fiscal 2008 was due to higher research and development expenses during this period we continued to invest in research and development for existing offerings as well as for new offerings almost 45 of the fiscal 2008 increase in total operating expenses in dollars was due to higher selling and marketing expenses of the total increase in selling and marketing expenses in dollars for this period about a third was due to our acquisition of digital insight whose selling costs are relatively higher compared with our other businesses because they sell their services to financial institutions through a direct sales force about 20 of the fiscal 2008 increase in selling and marketing expenses in dollars was due to higher advertising and other marketing expenses to support our consumer tax offerings excluding the impact of the increase in sharebased compensation expense general and administrative expenses declined about 5 million in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 

acquisitionrelated charges increased in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 primarily due to the amortization of digital insight purchased intangible assets which we acquired in february 2007 

fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006 individually and in the aggregate operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenue were generally consistent in fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006 total operating expenses in dollars increased about 206 million in fiscal 2007 approximately 60 million of which was due to our february 2007 acquisition of digital insight 

including digital insight approximately 42 of the fiscal 2007 increase in total operating expenses in dollars was due to higher research and development expenses during fiscal 2007 we continued to invest in research and development for existing offerings as well as for new offerings approximately 41 of the fiscal 2007 increase in total operating expenses in dollars was due to higher selling and marketing expenses that included increases in radio television and online advertising expenses for our consumer tax and quickbooks offerings as well as additional investments in direct marketing and product management 

acquisitionrelated charges increased in fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006 due to the amortization of digital insight purchased intangible assets which we acquired in february 2007

revenue has relatively higher costs of revenue than our combined payroll business low growth in cost of revenue in the segment was achieved through our transition of certain full service payroll customers which also have relatively higher costs of revenue to adp higher gross margins in fiscal 2008 were partially offset by higher expenses including increases of approximately 11 million for selling and marketing expenses approximately 17 million for product development expenses approximately 6 million for infrastructure costs and approximately 4 million in lease termination costs about a third of the fiscal 2008 increase in payroll and payments costs and expenses was associated with our acquisition of echo

fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 financial institutions segment operating income as a percentage of related revenue decreased to 19 in fiscal 2008 from 26 in fiscal 2007 the fiscal 2008 decrease in segment operating income was due to our february 2007 acquisition of digital insight which has higher costs and expenses including relatively higher costs of service revenue and higher selling expenses than the intuit financial institutions business that existed prior to the acquisition 

fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006 financial institutions segment operating income as a percentage of related revenue decreased to 26 in fiscal 2007 from 50 in fiscal 2006 the fiscal 2007 decrease in segment operating income was due to our february 2007 acquisition of digital insight which we combined with our existing financial institutions business to create a new financial institutions segment this new segment is significantly larger and has higher costs including relatively higher cost of service revenue and higher selling expenses than the intuit financial institutions business that preceded it 

other businesses 

fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 other businesses segment operating income as a percentage of related revenue decreased to 30 in fiscal 2008 from 34 in fiscal 2007 about a quarter of the 412 million in fiscal 2008 revenue growth in this segment came from our intuit real estate solutions business which sells its products and services through a direct sales force and therefore has a higher cost structure than the other businesses in this segment while revenue from our business in canada was higher in fiscal 2008 due in part to the weaker us dollar total costs and expenses for this business also increased due to the impact of foreign exchange rates in addition fiscal 2008 selling and marketing expenses in our business in canada increased in support of our latest quickbooks and consumer tax offerings 

fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006 other businesses segment operating income as a percentage of related revenue increased to 34 in fiscal 2007 from 30 in fiscal 2006 the fiscal 2007 improvement in segment operating income as a percentage of related revenue was due to the may 2006 sale of our masterbuilder business which had relatively low operating margins 

nonoperating income and expenses 

interest expense 

in march 2007 we issued 1 billion in senior notes to finance a portion of our february 2007 acquisition of digital insight and to fund our operations interest expense of 523 million for fiscal 2008 and 271 million for fiscal 2007 consisted primarily of interest on 500 million in principal amount of the senior notes at 540 and interest on 500 million in principal amount of the senior notes at 575 the senior notes are due in march 2012 and march 2017 and are redeemable by intuit at any time subject to a makewhole premium 

interest and other income 

 

interest and other income consists primarily of interest income lower interest rates and lower average invested balances resulted in lower interest income in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 higher interest rates and higher average invested balances resulted in higher interest income in fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006 total interest and other income for all periods presented included royalties and fees from trademark license and distribution agreements that we entered into when we sold our quicken loans mortgage business in july 2002 

income taxes 

effective tax rate 

our effective tax rate was approximately 35 for fiscal 2008 approximately 36 for fiscal 2007 and approximately 38 for fiscal 2006 our effective tax rate for fiscal 2008 did not differ significantly from the federal statutory rate state income taxes were offset primarily by the benefit we received from tax exempt interest income the domestic production activities deduction and federal and state research and experimental credits our effective tax rate for fiscal 2007 differed from the federal statutory rate of 35 due primarily to state income taxes which were partially offset by the benefit we received from tax exempt interest income federal and state research and experimental credits and the domestic production activities deduction in addition in fiscal 2007 we benefited from the retroactive extension of the federal research and experimental credit as it related to fiscal 2006 our effective tax rate for fiscal 2006 differed from the federal statutory rate of 35 primarily due to state income taxes and the taxable gain on the sale of our master builder business which were partially offset by the benefit we received from tax exempt interest income federal and state research and experimental credits and the domestic production activities deduction see note 11 to the financial statements in item 8 for more information 

in december 2006 the tax relief and health care act of 2006 was signed into law the act included a reinstatement of the federal research and experimental credit through december 31 2007 that was retroactive to january 1 2006 we recorded a discrete tax benefit of 37 million for the retroactive amount related to fiscal 2006 during fiscal 2007 

tax carryforwards 

we acquired electronic clearing house and homestead in fiscal 2008 and digital insight in fiscal 2007 see note 6 to the financial statements in item 8 these companies had federal net operating loss carryforwards at their respective dates of acquisition that totaled approximately 164 million we have recorded the tax effects of these carryforwards and other federal tax credit carryforwards which together totaled approximately 66 million as deferred tax assets at the respective dates of acquisition the carryforwards do not result in an income tax provision benefit but they reduce income taxes payable and cash paid for income taxes as we utilize them at july 31 2008 we had total federal net operating loss carryforwards of 950 million that will expire starting in fiscal 2019 

net deferred tax assets 

at july 31 2008 we had net deferred tax assets of 1542 million and no valuation allowance while we believe no valuation allowance was appropriate at that date it may be necessary to record a valuation allowance if it becomes more likely that we will not realize some portion of the net deferred tax assets we assess the need for an adjustment to the valuation allowance on a quarterly basis the assessment is based on our estimates of future sources of taxable income for the jurisdictions in which we operate and the periods over which our deferred tax assets will be realizable see note 11 to the financial statements in item 8 for more information

liquidity and capital resources 

overview 

at july 31 2008 our cash cash equivalents and investments totaled 8278 million a decrease of 4759 million from july 31 2007 this decrease was due to the reclassification of 2853 million in municipal auction rate securities to longterm investments see “auction rate securities” below and to the factors described in “statements of cash flows” below our primary source of liquidity has been cash from operations which entails the collection of accounts receivable for products and services our primary uses of cash have been for research and development programs selling and marketing activities capital projects debt service costs repurchases of common stock and acquisitions of businesses 

in march 2007 we issued fiveyear and tenyear senior unsecured notes totaling 1 billion we also have a 500 million unsecured revolving line of credit facility that is described later in this item 7 to date we have not borrowed under the facility 

the following table summarizes selected measures of our liquidity and capital resources at the dates indicated

auction rate securities 

at july 31 2008 we held 2853 million in municipal auction rate securities these securities are collateralized longterm debt instruments that provide liquidity through a dutch auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at predetermined intervals typically every 35 days due to a decrease in liquidity in the global credit markets in february 2008 auctions began failing for the municipal auction rate securities we held regularly scheduled 

auctions for these securities have generally continued to fail since that time when these auctions initially failed higher interest rates for many of the securities went into effect of the total auction rate securities we held at july 31 2008 the underlying assets of 2207 million or 77 were student loans which are guaranteed by the us department of education and 2412 million or 85 were rated aaaaaa by the major credit rating agencies 

we estimated the fair values of the municipal auction rate securities we held at july 31 2008 based on valuation reports from third parties and a discounted cash flow model that we prepared using the valuation reports from third parties and our discounted cash flow model we determined that the fair values of the municipal auction rate securities we held at july 31 2008 were substantially equal to their par values as a result we recorded no decrease in the fair values of those securities for the twelve months then ended based on our ability and intent to hold these auction rate securities until liquidity returned to the market or they matured we classified them as longterm investments on our balance sheet at july 31 2008 

in august 2008 the brokerdealers for our auction rate securities announced settlements under which they may provide liquidity solutions for or purchase the auction rate securities held by their institutional clients details of the agreements are still being finalized 

based on our expected operating cash flows and our other sources of cash we do not believe that the reduction in liquidity of our municipal auction rate securities will have a material impact on our overall ability to meet our liquidity needs 

statements of cash flows 

the following table summarizes selected items from our statements of cash flows for fiscal 2008 2007 and 2006 see the financial statements in item 8 for complete statements of cash flows for those periods

stock split 

on july 6 2006 we implemented a twoforone stock split in the form of a 100 stock dividend all share and per share figures in this item 7 and in the statements of operations and notes to the financial statements in item 8 retroactively reflect this stock split 

stock repurchase programs 

our board of directors has authorized a series of common stock repurchase programs shares of common stock repurchased under these programs become treasury shares during fiscal 2008 2007 and 2006 we repurchased 272 million 171 million and 310 million shares of our common stock for 8000 million 5066 million and 7842 million under our repurchase programs from the inception of these programs in may 2001 through the end of fiscal 2008 we repurchased 1859 million shares of our common stock for 46 billion at july 31 2008 we had authorization from our board to expend up to 600 million for stock repurchases through may 15 2011 

unsecured revolving credit facility 

on march 22 2007 we entered into an agreement with certain institutional lenders for a 500 million unsecured revolving credit facility that will expire on march 22 2012 advances under the credit facility will accrue interest at rates that are equal to at our election either citibank’s base rate or the london interbank offered rate libor 

plus a margin that ranges from 018 to 0575 based on our senior debt credit ratings the applicable interest rate will be increased by 005 for any period in which the total principal amount of advances and letters of credit under the credit facility exceeds 250 million the agreement includes covenants that require us to maintain a ratio of total debt to annual earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda of not greater than 325 to 100 and a ratio of annual ebitda to interest payable of not less than 300 to 100 we may use amounts borrowed under this credit facility for general corporate purposes or for future acquisitions or expansion of our business to date we have not borrowed under the credit facility but we may borrow under the credit facility from time to time as opportunities and needs arise see note 9 to the financial statements in item 8 

liquidity and capital resource requirements 

we evaluate on an ongoing basis the merits of acquiring technology or businesses or establishing strategic relationships with and investing in other companies we may decide to use cash and cash equivalents investments and our revolving line of credit facility to fund such activities in the future 

based on past performance and current expectations we believe that our cash and cash equivalents investments and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet anticipated seasonal working capital needs capital expenditure requirements contractual obligations commitments and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations for at least the next 12 months as discussed above in this item 7 under “auction rate securities” we do not believe that the reduction in the liquidity of our municipal auction rate securities will have a material impact on our overall ability to meet our liquidity needs 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

at july 31 2008 we did not have any significant offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of regulation sk

recent accounting pronouncements 

sfas 157 “fair value measurements” 

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas 157 “fair value measurements” sfas 157 provides enhanced guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities the standard also responds to investors’ requests for expanded information about the extent to which companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value the information used to measure fair value and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings sfas 157 applies whenever other standards require or permit assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value this standard does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances sfas 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 which means that it will be effective for our fiscal year beginning august 1 2008 we are in the process of evaluating this standard and therefore have not yet determined the impact that the adoption of sfas 157 will have on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

sfas 159 “the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities” 

in february 2007 the fasb issued sfas 159 “the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities” sfas 159 provides companies with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value the standard’s objective is to reduce both complexity in accounting for financial instruments and the volatility in earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently the standard requires companies to provide additional information that will help investors and other users of financial statements to more easily understand the effect of the company’s choice to use fair value on its earnings it also requires companies to display the fair value of those assets and liabilities for which the company has chosen to use fair value on the face of the balance sheet the new standard does not eliminate disclosure requirements included in other accounting standards including requirements for disclosures about fair value measurements included in sfas 157 “fair value measurements” and sfas 107 “disclosures about fair value of financial instruments” sfas 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 which means that it will be effective for our fiscal year beginning august 1 2008 we are in the process of evaluating this standard and therefore have not yet determined the impact that the adoption of sfas 159 will have on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

sfas 141 revised 2007 “business combinations” 

in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas 141 revised 2007 “ business combinations” sfas 141r will significantly change the accounting for business combinations in a number of areas including the measurement of assets and liabilities acquired and the treatment of contingent consideration contingencies acquisition costs inprocess research and development and restructuring costs in addition under sfas 141r changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and acquired income tax uncertainties in a business combination after the measurement period will affect the income tax provision sfas 141r is effective for business combinations for which the 

acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning after december 15 2008 which means that it will be effective for our fiscal year beginning august 1 2009 early adoption is prohibited we are in the process of evaluating this standard and therefore have not yet determined the impact that the adoption of sfas 141r will have on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

sfas 160 “noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements” 

in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas 160 “ noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements ” which establishes accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling minority interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary sfas 160 is effective for business arrangements entered into in fiscal years beginning on or after december 15 2008 which means that it will be effective for our fiscal year beginning august 1 2009 early adoption is prohibited we are in the process of evaluating this standard and therefore have not yet determined the impact that the adoption of sfas 160 will have on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

fsp sfas 1423 “ determination of the useful life of intangible assets” 

in april 2008 the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp sfas 1423 “ determination of the useful life of intangible assets” fsp sfas 1423 amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under sfas 142 “ goodwill and other intangible assets” this new staff position is intended to improve the consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under sfas 142 and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset under sfas 141r “business combinations” fsp sfas 1423 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2008 which means that it will be effective for our fiscal year beginning august 1 2009 we are in the process of evaluating this staff position and therefore have not yet determined the impact that adoption of fsp sfas 1423 will have on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

investment portfolio 

our investments consist of instruments that meet quality standards that are consistent with our investment policy this policy specifies that except for direct obligations of the united states government securities issued by agencies of the united states government and money market funds we diversify our investments by limiting our holdings with any individual issuer we do not hold derivative financial instruments in our portfolio of investments 

see note 2 to the financial statements in item 8 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — liquidity and capital resources” in item 7 and “risk factors” in item 1a of this annual report on form 10k for a description of market events that have affected the liquidity of certain municipal auction rate securities that we held at july 31 2008 

the following table presents our portfolio of cash equivalents and availableforsale debt securities as of july 31 2008 by stated maturity the table is classified by the original maturity date listed on the security and includes cash equivalents which consist primarily of money market funds at july 31 2008 the weighted average interest rate earned on our money market accounts was 273 and the weighted average tax adjusted interest rate earned on our investments was 603 

 

interest rate risk 

our cash equivalents and investments are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates interest rate movements affect the interest income we earn on cash equivalents and investments and the value of those investments should the federal reserve target rate increase by 25 basis points from the level of july 31 2008 the value of our investments would decline by approximately 11 million should interest rates increase by 100 basis points from the level of july 31 2008 the value of our investments would decline by approximately 44 million 

we are also exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates as they affect our 500 million revolving credit facility advances under the credit facility accrue interest at rates that are equal to citibank’s base rate or the london interbank offered rate libor plus a margin that ranges from 018 to 0575 based on our senior debt credit ratings consequently our interest expense would fluctuate with changes in the general level of these interest rates if we were to borrow any amounts under the credit facility at july 31 2008 no amounts were outstanding under the credit facility 

on march 12 2007 we issued 500 million of 540 senior unsecured notes due on march 15 2012 and 500 million of 575 senior unsecured notes due on march 15 2017 since these senior notes bear interest at fixed rates they are not subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates 

impact of foreign currency rate changes 

the functional currencies of our international operating subsidiaries are the local currencies we translate the assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries at the exchange rates in effect on the balance sheet date we translate their revenue costs and expenses at the average rates of exchange in effect during the period we include translation 

gains and losses in the stockholders’ equity section of our balance sheet we include net gains and losses resulting from foreign exchange transactions in interest and other income in our statements of operations 

since we translate foreign currencies primarily canadian dollars british pounds and indian rupees into us dollars for financial reporting purposes currency fluctuations can have an impact on our financial results the historical impact of currency fluctuations has generally been immaterial we believe that our exposure to currency exchange fluctuation risk is not significant primarily because our global subsidiaries invoice customers and satisfy their financial obligations almost exclusively in their local currencies although the impact of currency fluctuations on our financial results has generally been immaterial in the past and we believe that for the reasons cited above currency fluctuations will not be significant in the future there can be no guarantee that the impact of currency fluctuations will not be material in the future as of july 31 2008 we did not engage in foreign currency hedging activities

company growth strategy 

our strategy is to be in growth businesses highprofit businesses and attractive new markets with large unmet or underserved needs that we can solve well our core competency is customerdriven innovation applied to solve important customer problems simply we seek to continuously improve our existing solutions to delight customers by creating product and service experiences that are dramatically better than the alternatives we approach new opportunities by developing products and services designed to attract customers who do not use software products nonconsumption and by offering solutions that have better value compared with higherpriced alternatives disruption this strategy helps us to build large user bases and create durable competitive advantage 

our offerings serve consumers small business and tax customers and accounting professionals who are both customers and recommenders of our products and services we divide potential customers into three groups 

 

four fundamentals support our growth strategy 

 

right for me initiatives 

our focus on customer needs is embodied in right for me initiatives rather than approach our targeted markets with a “one size fits all” mentality we dig deeper to understand the many different needs of various customer segments we then use this knowledge to develop products and services to meet those different needs over the past 

several years for example we have gone from offering just two versions of quickbooks to offering many quickbooks solutions that address different needs see “products and services” below for more information 

products and services 

intuit offers its products and services in six business segments quickbooks payroll and payments consumer tax professional tax financial institutions and other businesses for financial information about these segments see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in item 7 and note 8 to the financial statements in item 8 

classes of similar products or services that accounted for 10 or more of total net revenue in fiscal 2007 2006 and 2005 were as follows 

 

our primary products and services are sold mainly in the united states and are described below international total net revenue was less than 5 of consolidated total net revenue for fiscal 2007 2006 and 2005

product development 

since the personal computer and software industries are characterized by rapid technological change shifting customer needs and frequent new product introductions and enhancements a continuous high level of investment is required for the enhancement of existing products and the development of new products we develop the majority of our products internally we may also supplement our internal development efforts by acquiring strategically important products and technology from third parties or establishing other relationships that enable us to enhance or expand our offerings more rapidly we have a number of united states patents and pending applications that relate to various aspects of our products and technology 

our traditional core desktop software products – quickbooks quicken turbotax lacerte and proseries – tend to have fairly predictable structured development cycles of about a year with annual product releases we also develop new products for which development cycles are less predictable developing consumer and professional tax software presents unique challenges because of the demanding development cycle required to accurately incorporate tax law and tax form changes within a rigid timetable the development timing for our other small business and financial institutions offerings varies with business needs and regulatory requirements and the length of the development cycle depends on the scope and complexity of each particular project 

in our financial institutions business we have relationships and have developed interfaces with most of the major vendors of core processing software and outsourced core processing services to financial institutions these system interfaces allow us to access a financial institution’s host system to provide end users access to their account data in addition to developing new interfaces we continue to significantly enhance our many existing interfaces in order to deliver more robust connectivity and increase operating efficiencies 

we continue to make substantial investments in research and development our future research and development efforts will be focused on enhancing existing products and services and on developing new products and services to address customer needs in existing and new markets we anticipate that the products we develop in the future will offer increased ease of use be customized for specific customer categories be webintegrated or webbased and feature improved integration with other intuit and third party products and services and with our internal information systems we also expect to continue to focus significant research and development efforts on multiyear projects to modernize the technology platforms for many of our products our research and development expenses were 4725 million or 17 of total net revenue in fiscal 2007 3858 million or 17 of total net revenue in fiscal 2006 and 2926 million or 15 of total net revenue in fiscal 2005 

seasonality 

our quickbooks consumer tax and professional tax businesses are highly seasonal some of our other offerings are also seasonal but to a lesser extent revenue from many of our small business software products including quickbooks tends to be at its peak around calendar year end although the timing of new product releases or changes in our offerings can materially shift revenue between quarters sales of income tax preparation products and services are heavily concentrated in the period from november through april in our consumer tax business a greater proportion of our revenue has been occurring later in this seasonal period due in part to the growth in sales of turbotax online for which revenue is recognized upon filing these seasonal patterns mean that our total net 

revenue is usually highest during our second quarter ending january 31 and third quarter ending april 30 we typically report losses in our first quarter ending october 31 and fourth quarter ending july 31 when revenue from our tax businesses is minimal while operating expenses continue at relatively consistent levels 

marketing sales and distribution channels 

markets 

our primary target customers are small and medium sized businesses consumers accounting professionals and small and medium sized financial institutions the markets in which we compete have always been characterized by rapid technological change shifting customer needs and frequent new product introductions and enhancements by competitors over the past few years the internet has accelerated the pace of change and revolutionized the way that customers learn about and purchase products realtime personalized online experiences are rapidly becoming the standard many customers now begin their shopping process online and make their purchase either online or at a retail location driving the need to create integrated multichannel shop and buy experiences market and industry changes are quickly rendering existing products and services obsolete so our success depends on our ability to respond rapidly to these changes with new business models updated competitive strategies new or enhanced products and services alternative distribution methods and other changes in the way we do business 

our target customers for outsourced online consumer and business banking are small and medium sized financial institutions seeking a comprehensive internet solution in order to compete with the larger national banks in their market the majority of our sales opportunities are with financial institutions evaluating a conversion from a competitive internet banking platform often in response to end user demands for increased functionality to a lesser degree we market to newlycreated banks and other financial institutions that have yet to offer online banking to their customers 

marketing programs 

to sell our products and services to small businesses consumers and accounting professionals we use a variety of marketing programs to generate software orders stimulate demand and generally maintain and increase customer awareness of our products and services these programs include directresponse mail and email campaigns web marketing including purchasing key words from major search engine companies telephone solicitations newspaper magazine billboard radio and television advertising and promotional offers that we coordinate with major retailers and computer original equipment manufacturers or oems we also use workflowintegrated inproduct messaging in some of our software products to market other related products and services including thirdparty products and services 

in our financial institutions business our marketing efforts are primarily focused on identifying potential financial institution clients and marketing our services to consumer end users in cooperation with our financial institution clients our marketing efforts include press relations advertising direct mail trade show meetings with internet banking user groups and client conferences hosted by us and our core processing partners we offer cooperative marketing programs under which our financial institution clients partner with us to promote higher adoption and retention of the online channel and crosssell additional products to online end users we also receive marketing benefits in our financial institutions business from endorsements and promotional arrangements we are exclusively endorsed by the american bankers association aba for our internet banking product and we have promotional arrangements with several state banking associations that promote our products to their constituents 

sales and distribution channels 

multichannel shop and buy experiences our customers increasingly use the internet to research products and services some customers buy these products and services online while others prefer to make their final decision at a retail location we tailor our web sites promotions and retail displays to this emerging integrated multichannel shop and buy model 

direct sales channel  we sell many of our products and services for small businesses consumers and accounting professionals directly to our customers through our web sites and call centers 

in our financial institutions business we sell our products and services to financial institutions using a direct sales model and to a lesser extent in cooperation with core processing partners our sales and account management team is primarily organized by financial institution asset size and location our typical sales cycle is approximately six to twelve months for new financial institutions and four to six months for addon sales to existing customers financial institutions sales compensation plans are aligned with our primary goals of driving new sales renewing contracts with existing customers and selling addon products to existing customers 

retail distribution channel  we sell our quickbooks turbotax and quicken software and small business payroll services at retail in the united states by selling directly and through distributors to office supply superstores warehouse clubs consumer electronics retailers general mass merchandisers ecommerce companies and catalogers in canada and other international markets we also rely on distributors and other third parties who sell products into the retail channel 

we continue to benefit from strong relationships with a number of major north american retailers which allows us to minimize our dependence on any specific retailer we deliver products to larger retailers through a combination of direct to store deliveries and shipments to central warehouse locations we also sell and ship products for many of our smaller retail customers through distributors see “manufacturing and distribution” later in this item 1 we continue to aggressively manage our inventory to optimize instock presence and ensure good product placement within retail stores in response to current retail trends we are also placing a greater proportion of inventory with retailers on a consignment basis 

oem channel  through our relationships with selected personal computer oems we sell software to customers purchasing new oem systems and we sell products offered by oems to their customers after the point of sale although revenue from our oem channel is much less significant than revenue from our other distribution channels oem relationships help us to attract new customers and generate sales of our core desktop software products 

thirdparty “valueadded” distribution arrangements  in our financial institutions business we have joint marketing arrangements with several core processing vendors more than half of our financial institutions segment revenue is derived from these referral and reseller agreements with core processing vendors they include fiserv open solutions inc fidelity information services inc metavante corporation and computer services inc to deliver bill payment and bill presentment services to our financial institution customers we also maintain valueadded reseller relationships with major providers such as metavante corporation and checkfree corporation we have integrated these products into our offerings enabling financial institutions to offer bill payment and bill presentment within their online banking suites 

we supplement our small business and consumer direct sales capabilities and our retail and oem distribution relationships with selected thirdparty distribution arrangements we believe these relationships will enhance the growth opportunities for certain product and service offerings by allowing us to benefit from the valueadded marketing and sales expertise of these third parties for example our innovative merchant solutions merchant services business participates in a limited liability company that acquires merchant customers for ims see note 1 to the financial statements in item 8 during fiscal 2008 and beyond we expect to continue to optimize expand and support our network of thirdparty relationships 

competition 

overview 

we face intense competition in all of our businesses both domestically and internationally competitive interest and expertise in many of the markets we serve particularly small business consumer tax and online banking has grown markedly over the past few years and we expect this trend to continue some of our existing competitors have significantly greater financial technical and marketing resources than we do as we implement our customerdriven strategies we face increased competitive threats from larger companies than we have historically faced in addition the competitive landscape can shift rapidly as new companies enter markets in which we compete this is particularly true for webbased products and services where the barriers to entry are lower than they are for more traditional software products and services to attract customers many new webbased competitors are offering free or lowpriced entrylevel products which we must take into account in our pricing strategies 

our most obvious competition comes from other companies that offer technology solutions similar to ours however for many of our products and services other important competitive alternatives for customers are manual tools and processes or generalpurpose software many of our new customers have used pencil and paper or software such as word processors and spreadsheets rather than competitors’ software and services to perform financial tasks for example many taxpayers prepared their tax returns manually before using turbotax a large number of small businesses used spreadsheets to keep their books and calculate their payrolls before purchasing quickbooks and many end user customers used paper checkbooks to track their bank accounts and pay their bills before using online banking software we believe that there is a longterm trend away from manual methods and toward the use of both online and desktop software to accomplish these tasks that will provide us future growth opportunities 

competition specific to business segments 

small business quickbooks is the leading product in the retail sales channel for its category we face significant competitive challenges in our quickbooks business and our payroll and payments business from microsoft corporation which in september 2005 launched accounting software and associated services that directly target small business customers increasingly our small business products and services also face competition from free online banking and payment services offered by financial institutions and others in our merchant services business we also compete directly with a number of independent sales organizations none of which dominates the market 

consumer tax  in the private sector we face intense competition primarily from hr block the makers of taxcut software and increasingly from webbased offerings such as 2nd story software’s taxact where we are subject to significant and increasing price pressure we also compete for customers with assisted tax preparation businesses such as hr block 

we also face potential competitive challenges in our consumer tax business from publicly funded government entities that offer electronic tax preparation and filing services at no cost to individual taxpayers we are a member of the free file alliance a consortium of private sector companies that signed an agreement with the federal government in october 2002 that was renewed for four years in october 2005 under this agreement a number of private sector companies rather than the federal government have been providing webbased federal tax preparation and filing services at no cost to eligible federal taxpayers through initiatives such as our intuit tax freedom project approximately 20 states have also adopted free file alliance publicprivate agreements while approximately 20 other states offer some form of direct government tax preparation and filing services free to qualified taxpayers we continue to actively work with others in the private and public sectors to advance the goals of the free file alliance policy initiative and to support successful publicprivate partnerships however future administrative regulatory or legislative activity in this area could harm our consumer tax business 

professional tax our proseries professional tax offerings face pricing pressure from competitors seeking to obtain our customers through deep product discounts and loss of customers to competitors with offerings at lower prices our lacerte professional tax offerings face competition from competitivelypriced tax and accounting solutions that include integration with nontax functionality 

financial institutions the market for internet banking services is highly competitive in the area of retail internet banking we primarily compete with other companies that provide outsourced online banking services to financial institutions including online resources s1 corporation and fundsxpress a subsidiary of first data corporation also vendors such as corillian now part of checkfree corporation that primarily target the largest financial institutions occasionally compete with us in our market segment in addition fiserv open solutions inc fidelity information services inc jack henry metavante corporation and several other vendors of core processing services to financial institutions offer their own online banking products although many of these firms also offer our products through a referral or reseller arrangement with us our primary competitors in the business banking services market segment are vendors of business banking systems for large corporations and include ph solutions banklink fundtech and s1 corporation 

the following table shows the significant competitors for each of our major products and services 

 

competitive factors 

we believe the most important competitive factors for our core software products – quickbooks quicken turbotax lacerte and proseries – are ease of use product features size of the installed customer base brand name recognition value and product and support quality access to distribution channels is also important for our quickbooks turbotax and quicken products in addition the ability for customers to upgrade within product families as their businesses grow is a significant competitive factor for our quickbooks products productivity is also an important competitive factor for the fullservice accounting firms to which we market our lacerte products we believe we compete effectively on these factors as our quickbooks quicken and turbotax products are the leading products in the retail sales channel for their respective categories 

for our service offerings such as small business payroll merchant services and outsourced online banking features and ease of use the integration of these products with related software brand name recognition effective distribution quality of support and scalability of operations are important competitive factors 

customer service and technical support 

we provide customer service and technical support by telephone email online chat online communities and our customer service and technical support web sites we have fulltime and outsourced customer service and technical support staffs which we supplement with seasonal employees and additional outsourcing during periods of peak call volumes such as during the tax return filing season or following a major product launch we outsource to several firms domestically and internationally most of our internationally outsourced consumer and small business customer service and technical support personnel are currently located in india and the philippines 

we offer free selfhelp information through our technical support web sites for quickbooks quicken turbotax and our professional tax software products customers use our web sites to find answers to commonly asked questions and check on the status of orders under certain support plans customers can also use our web sites to receive product updates electronically support alternatives and fees vary by product we also sponsor online user communities where customers can share product advice with each other 

manufacturing and distribution 

desktop software and supplies 

the major steps involved in manufacturing desktop software are manufacturing cds printing boxes and related materials and assembling and shipping the final products we have a manufacturing agreement with moduslink corp under which moduslink provides substantially all outsourced manufacturing related to our retail launches of quickbooks turbotax and quicken as well as for daytoday retail order fulfillment after product launches we have centralized the manufacturing for our retail products in a moduslink facility which is colocated with our primary retail fulfillment vendor ingram micro logistics iml a division of ingram micro inc moduslink has operations in multiple locations that can provide redundancy if necessary we also outsource the product manufacturing and distribution for most of our direct sales orders to arvato services inc a division of bertelsmann ag we use harland clarke a division of mf worldwide corporation exclusively to fulfill orders for all of our printed checks and most other products for our financial supplies business 

our retail product launches are operationally complex our model for product delivery for retail launches and replenishment is a hybrid of direct to store deliveries and shipments to central warehouse locations this allows improved inventory management by our retailers we also ship products for many of our smaller retail customers through distributors we have an agreement with iml under which iml handles all logistics fulfillment and similar functions for our retail sales 

we have multiple sources for all of our raw materials and availability has historically not been a significant problem for us prior to major product releases for our core desktop software products we tend to have significant levels of backlog but at other times backlog is minimal and we typically ship products within a few days of receiving an order because of this fluctuation in backlog we believe that backlog is not a reliable predictor of our future core desktop software sales 

internetbased products and services 

intuit’s data centers house most of the systems networks and databases required to operate and deliver our internetbased products and services these include quickbooks online edition online payroll products and services for quickbooks and nonquickbooks users turbotax online consumer and professional electronic tax filing services and digital insight outsourced online banking applications and services through our data centers we connect customers to products and services and we store the vast amount of data that represents the content on our web sites as our businesses continue to move toward delivering more webbased products and services this infrastructure will become even more critical in the future our data centers consist of numerous servers and databases located in several sites across the united states due to our evolving business needs we have begun executing a plan to build a new data center in washington state to support our longer term hosting and system availability requirements 

privacy and security of customer information and transactions 

we are subject to various federal state and international laws and regulations and to financial institution requirements relating to the privacy and security of customer and employee personal information we are also subject to laws and regulations that apply to telemarketing and email activities additional laws in both areas are likely to be passed in the future which could result in significant limitations on the ways in which we can use personal information and communicate with our customers or may significantly increase our compliance costs if our business expands to new industry segments that are regulated for privacy and security or to countries outside the united states that have strict data protections laws our compliance requirements and costs will increase 

we comply with united states federal and other country guidelines and practices to help ensure that customers are aware of and can control how we use information about them our primary web sites such as quickbookscom and turbotaxcom have been certified by truste an independent nonprofit organization that operates a web site privacy certification program representing industry standard practices to address users’ and regulators’ concerns about online privacy we also use privacy statements to provide notice to customers of our privacy practices as well as provide them the opportunity to furnish instructions with respect to use of their personal information 

to address security concerns we use security safeguards to help protect the systems and the information customers give to us from loss misuse and unauthorized alteration whenever customers transmit sensitive information such as a credit card number or tax return data to us through one of our web sites that information is stored on servers that allow encryption of the information as it is transmitted to us we work to protect our systems from unauthorized internal or external access using numerous commercially available computer security products as well as internally developed security procedures and practices 

government regulation 

the financial services industry is subject to extensive and complex federal and state regulation our financial institution customers which include commercial banks and credit unions operate in markets that are subject to rigorous regulatory oversight and supervision the compliance of our products and services with these requirements depends on a variety of factors including the particular functionality the interactive design and the charter or license of the financial institution our financial services customers must independently assess and determine what is required of them under these regulations and are responsible for ensuring that our system and the design of their web sites conform to their regulatory obligations 

we are not licensed by the office of the comptroller of the currency the board of governors of the federal reserve system the office of thrift supervision the federal deposit insurance corporation the national credit union administration or other federal or state agencies that regulate or supervise depository institutions or other providers of financial services our digital insight subsidiary is examined by the federal financial institution examination council under the information technology examination guidelines although we believe we are not subject to direct supervision by federal and state banking agencies with regard to other regulations we have from time to time agreed to examinations of our business and operations by these agencies we are also subject to encryption and security export laws and regulations which depending on future developments could render our business or operations more costly less efficient or impossible 

our consumer tax and professional tax businesses are also subject to federal and state government requirements including regulations related to the electronic filing of tax returns the provision of tax preparer assistance and the use of customer information in addition we offer certain other products and services such as small business payroll which are subject to special regulatory requirements as we expand our financial institutions tax and small business products and services we may become subject to additional government regulation new laws or regulations may be adopted in these areas that could impose significant limitations on our business and increase our cost of compliance we continually analyze new business opportunities and new businesses that we pursue may require additional costs for regulatory compliance 

intellectual property 

we regard our products as proprietary we attempt to protect our intellectual property by relying on a combination of copyright patent trade secret and trademark laws restrictions on disclosure and other methods in particular we have a substantial number of registered trademarks including intuit quickbooks turbotax lacerte proseries digital insight and quicken we have registered these and other trademarks and service marks in the united states and depending on the relevance of each brand to other markets in many foreign countries most registrations can be renewed perpetually at 10year intervals we also currently hold a small but growing patent portfolio we regularly file applications for patents copyrights and trademarks and service marks in order to protect proprietary intellectual property that we believe is important to our business we also license some intellectual property from third parties for use in our products 

we face a number of risks relating to our intellectual property including unauthorized use and unauthorized copying or piracy of our products litigation may be necessary to protect our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others patents that have been issued to us could be determined to be invalid and may not be enforceable against competitive products in every jurisdiction furthermore other parties have asserted and may in the future assert infringement claims against us these claims and any litigation may result in invalidation of our proprietary rights or a finding of infringement against us along with an assessment of damages litigation even if not meritorious could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention in addition third party licenses may not continue to be available to us on commercially acceptable terms or at all

as of july 31 2007 we had approximately 8200 employees in major offices in the united states canada the united kingdom and other locations we believe our future success and growth will depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees in all areas of our business we do not currently have any collective bargaining agreements with our employees and we believe employee relations are generally good although we have employmentrelated agreements with a number of key employees these agreements do not guarantee continued service we believe we offer competitive compensation and a good working environment we were named one of fortune magazine’s “100 best companies to work for” in each of the last six years however we face intense competition for qualified employees and we expect to face continuing challenges in recruiting and retention

risk factors 

forwardlooking statements and risk factors 

this annual report on form 10k contains forwardlooking statements all statements in this report other than statements that are purely historical are forwardlooking statements words such as “expects” “anticipates” “intends” “plans” “believes” “forecasts” “estimates” “seeks” and similar expressions also identify forwardlooking statements in this report forwardlooking statements include without limitation the following 

 

we caution investors that forwardlooking statements are only predictions based on our current expectations about future events and are not guarantees of future performance we encourage you to read carefully all information provided in this report and in our other filings with the sec before deciding to invest in our stock or to maintain or change your investment these forwardlooking statements are based on information as of the filing date of this annual report and we undertake no obligation to revise or update any forwardlooking statement for any reason 

because forwardlooking statements involve risks and uncertainties there are important factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forwardlooking statements these factors include the following 

we face intense competitive pressures in all of our businesses that may harm our operating results 

we have formidable competitors and we expect competition to remain intense during fiscal 2008 and beyond the number resources and sophistication of the companies with whom we compete have increased as we continue to expand our product and service offerings our competitors may introduce new and improved products and services bundle new offerings with marketleading products reduce prices gain better access to distribution channels advertise aggressively or beat us to market with new products and services we also face growing competition from providers of free online and desktop accounting tax banking and other financial services any of these competitive actions taken over any prolonged period could diminish our revenue and profitability and could affect our ability to keep existing customers and acquire new customers 

quickbooks and payroll and payments losing existing or potential quickbooks customers to competitors causes us to lose potential revenue in the shortterm and limits our opportunities to sell related products and services in the future many competitors provide accounting and business management products and services to small businesses for example microsoft corporation currently offers a version of its small business accounting software for no additional charge to users of its operating system and offers in partnership with third parties several other competitive products and services for small businesses although we have successfully competed with microsoft in the past microsoft’s small business offerings may have a significant negative impact on our future revenue and profitability 

we may experience pricing pressure for our small business payroll offerings due to the larger size and economies of scale of certain competitors in that business the growth of electronic banking and other electronic payment systems is decreasing the demand for checks and consequently causing pricing pressure for our financial supplies business as competitors aggressively compete for share of this shrinking market 

consumer tax our consumer tax business faces significant competition from both the public and private sector in the public sector we face the risk of federal and state taxing authorities developing or contracting to provide software or other systems to facilitate tax return preparation and electronic filing at no charge to taxpayers 

 

 

previously charged separate fees which could lead to a decrease or deferral of revenue and could harm our operating results 

professional tax our proseries professional tax offerings face pricing pressure from competitors seeking to obtain our customers through deep product discounts and loss of customers to competitors with offerings at lower prices our lacerte professional tax offerings face competition from competitivelypriced tax and accounting solutions that include integration with nontax functionality 

financial institutions in february 2007 we completed the acquisition of digital insight corporation which provides outsourced online banking applications and services to financial institutions including banks and credit unions we now compete with several companies that provide these services to financial institutions the market for online banking services is highly competitive we face competition from two main sources other companies similar to digital insight that offer outsourced internet banking offerings and vendors of core processing services to financial institutions also vendors that primarily target the largest financial institutions occasionally compete in our target market in some instances we also compete with companies with whom we have referral or reseller relationships some of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories and may be in a better position to produce and market their services due to their greater technical marketing and other resources as well as their greater name recognition and larger installed bases of customers in addition many of our competitors have wellestablished relationships with our current and potential financial institution customers and core processing vendors and have extensive knowledge of our industry 

as we negotiate the renewal of longterm service contracts with current customers we may be subject to competitive pressures and other factors that may require concessions on pricing and other material contract terms to induce the customer to remain with us we depend on our financial institution clients to market and promote our products to their end user customers but these efforts may not be successful and we may not be able to persuade potential customers to adopt our solutions in place of financial institutions’ own proprietary solutions or offerings by third parties if we are unable to compete effectively with other online banking service providers our business results may suffer 

future revenue growth for our core products depends upon our successful introduction of new and enhanced products and services 

a number of our businesses derive a significant amount of their revenue through onetime upfront license fees and rely on customer upgrades and service offerings to generate a significant portion of their revenues in addition our consumer tax business depends significantly on revenue from customers who return each year to use our updated tax preparation and filing software and services as our existing products mature encouraging customers to purchase product upgrades becomes more challenging unless new product releases provide features and functionality that have meaningful incremental value if we are not able to develop and clearly demonstrate the value of upgraded products to our customers our upgrade and service revenues will be harmed similarly our business will be harmed if we are not successful in our efforts to develop and introduce new products and services to retain our existing customers expand our customer base and increase revenues per customer unless our online banking offerings are successfully deployed and marketed by a significant number of financial institutions and achieve widespread market acceptance by their end user customers for a significant period of time our business may also be harmed 

in some cases we may expend a significant amount of resources and management attention on products or services that do not ultimately succeed in their markets we have encountered difficulty in launching new products and services in the past for example due to lack of customer demand we discontinued our snaptax consumer tax offering at the end of fiscal 2005 and we discontinued our easy estimator for contractors offering at the end of fiscal 2007 if we misjudge customer needs our new products and services will not succeed and our revenues and earnings will be harmed as we expand our offerings to new customer categories we run the risk of customers shifting from higher priced and higher margin products to newly introduced lower priced offerings for instance our quickbooks simple start and proseries basic offerings may attract users that would otherwise have purchased our higher priced more full featured offerings 

if we fail to maintain reliable and responsive service levels for our electronic tax offerings or if the irs or other governmental agencies experience difficulties in receiving customer submissions we could lose customers and our revenue and earnings could decrease 

our webbased tax preparation services and electronic filing services are an important and growing part of our tax businesses and must effectively handle extremely heavy customer demand during the peak tax season from january to april we face significant risks and challenges in maintaining these services and maintaining adequate service levels particularly during peak volume service times similarly governmental entities receiving electronic tax filings must also handle large volumes of data and may experience difficulties with their systems preventing the receipt of electronic filings if customers are unable to file their returns electronically they may elect to make paper filings this would result in reduced electronic tax return preparation and filing revenues and would harm our reputation and ability to attract and retain customers for example on april 17 2007 our customers experienced significant delays in electronically filing their income tax returns due to an intermittent database problem in our efiling system we refunded approximately 9 million in credit card charges for our consumer electronic filing and online tax preparation services that were made during the time that the delays occurred these refunds did not have a significant impact on our fiscal 2007 financial condition or results of operations however we may experience problems with our online systems and services in the future and any prolonged interruptions in our webbased tax preparation or electronic filing service at any time during the tax season would result in lost customers additional refunds of customer charges negative publicity and increased operating costs any of which could significantly harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

the nature of our products necessitates timely product launches and if we experience significant product quality problems or delays it will harm our revenue earnings and reputation 

all of our tax products and many of our nontax products have rigid development timetables that increase the risk of errors in our products and the risk of launch delays our tax preparation software product development cycle is particularly challenging due to the need to incorporate unpredictable tax law and tax form changes each year and because our customers expect high levels of accuracy and a timely launch of these products to prepare and file their taxes by the tax filing deadline due to the complexity of our products and the condensed development cycles under which we operate our products sometimes contain “bugs” that can unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the software when we encounter problems we may be required to modify our code distribute patches to customers who have already purchased the product and recall or repackage existing product inventory in our distribution channels if we encounter development challenges or discover errors in our products late in our development cycle it may cause us to delay our product launch date any major defects or launch delays could lead to loss of customers and revenue negative publicity customer and employee dissatisfaction reduced retailer shelf space and promotions and increased operating expenses such as inventory replacement costs legal fees or payments resulting from our commitment to reimburse penalties and interest paid by customers due solely to calculation errors in our consumer tax preparation products 

our businesses collect use and retain personal customer information and enable customer transactions which presents security risks requires us to incur expenses and could harm our business 

a number of our businesses collect use and retain large amounts of personal customer information including credit card numbers tax return information bank account numbers and passwords personal and business financial data social security numbers and other payroll information these businesses also enable customers to perform various transactions in addition we collect and maintain personal information of our employees in the ordinary course of our business some of this personal customer and employee information is held and some transactions are executed by third parties we and our vendors use commercially available security technologies to protect transactions and personal information we use security and business controls to limit access and use of personal information however a third party may be able to circumvent these security and business measures and errors in the storage use or transmission of personal information could result in a breach of customer or employee privacy or theft of assets we employ contractors temporary and seasonal employees who may have access to the personal information of customers and employees or who may execute transactions in the normal course of their duties while we conduct necessary and appropriate background checks of these individuals and limit access to systems and data it is possible that one or more of these individuals could circumvent these controls resulting in a security breach the ability to execute transactions and the possession and use of personal information in conducting our

business subjects us to legislative and regulatory burdens that could require notification of a security breach restrict our use of personal information and hinder our ability to acquire new customers or market to existing customers we have incurred — and will continue to incur — significant expenses to comply with mandatory privacy and security standards and protocols imposed by law regulation industry standards or contractual obligations 

in the past we have experienced lawsuits and negative publicity relating to privacy issues and we could face similar suits in the future a major breach of our security measures or those of third parties that execute transactions or hold and manage personal information could have serious negative consequences for our businesses including possible fines penalties and damages reduced customer demand for our services harm to our reputation and brands further regulation and oversight by federal or state agencies and loss of our ability to provide financial transaction services or accept and process customer credit card orders or tax returns from time to time we detect or receive notices from customers or public or private agencies that they have detected vulnerabilities in our software or in thirdparty software components that are distributed with our products the existence of vulnerabilities even if they do not result in a security breach can harm customer confidence and require substantial resources to address and we may not be able to discover or remediate such security vulnerabilities before they are exploited although we have sophisticated network and application security internal control measures and physical security procedures to safeguard our systems there can be no assurance that a security breach loss or theft of personal information will not occur which could harm our business customer reputation and results of operations if our business expands to new industry segments that are regulated for privacy and security or to countries outside the united states that have more strict data protection laws our compliance requirements and costs will increase 

our revenue and earnings are highly seasonal and our quarterly results fluctuate significantly 

several of our businesses are highly seasonal causing significant quarterly fluctuations in our financial results revenue and operating results are usually strongest during the second and third fiscal quarters ending january 31 and april 30 due to our tax businesses contributing most of their revenue during those quarters and the timing of the release of our small business software products and upgrades we experience lower revenues and significant operating losses in the first and fourth quarters ending october 31 and july 31 for example in the second and third quarters of fiscal 2006 and 2007 we had total net revenue of between 7315 million and 114 billion while in the first and fourth quarters of fiscal 2006 and 2007 we had total net revenue of between 2921 million and 4327 million our financial results can also fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year due to a variety of factors including changes in product sales mix that affect average selling prices product release dates the timing of our discontinuance of support for older product offerings our methods for distributing our products including the shift to a consignment model for some of our desktop products sold through retail distribution channels changes to our bundling strategy including the inclusion of upgrades with certain offerings changes to how we communicate the availability of new functionality in the future and the timing of our delivery of state tax forms any of which can impact the pattern of revenue recognition and the timing of acquisitions divestitures and goodwill and purchased intangible asset impairment charges 

the growth of our business depends on our ability to adapt to rapid technological change 

the software industry in which we operate is characterized by rapidly changing technology evolving industry standards and frequent new product introductions and enhancements we must continually invest in our software architecture and developer tools in order to enhance our current products and develop new products to meet changing customer needs and to attract and retain talented software developers we are currently in the process of modernizing the software platforms for a number of our product lines including our quickbooks payroll merchant services turbotax lacerte proseries and quicken products and services completing these upgrades and adapting to other technological developments may require considerable time and expense if we experience prolonged delays or unforeseen difficulties in upgrading our software architecture our ability to develop new products and enhancements to our current products would suffer 

interruption or failure of our information technology and communications systems could compromise the availability and security of our online products and services which could damage our reputation and harm our operating results 

the availability of our online products and services including turbotax online tax filing services quickbooks online edition online payroll and banking services and online commerce sites depends on a the continuing operation of our information technology and communication systems and those of our external service providers any damage to or failure of our systems could result in interruptions in our service which could reduce our revenues and profits and damage our brand in order to prevent interruptions to the availability of our ecommerce web sites and internetbased products and services we have implemented practices for creating a faulttolerant 

environment however we do not have complete redundancy for all of our systems and our disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities despite our efforts to maintain continuous and reliable server operations we occasionally experience unplanned outages or technical difficulties due to our evolving business needs and real estate planning we have begun executing a plan to build a new data center in washington state to support our longer term hosting requirements if we do not execute this transition to the new data center in an effective manner we could experience unplanned service disruptions or unforeseen increases in cost which could harm our operating results and our business we do not maintain realtime backup of our data and in the event of significant system disruption particularly during peak tax filing season we could experience loss of data or processing capabilities which could cause us to lose customers and could materially harm our reputation and our operating results 

our data centers and our information technology and communications systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters malicious attacks fire power loss telecommunications failures computer viruses computer denial of service attacks or other attempts to harm our systems if hackers were able to circumvent our security measures we could lose proprietary information or experience significant disruptions in the delivery of our products and services if our systems become unavailable or suffer a security breach we may expend significant resources to address these problems and our reputation and operating results could suffer 

we rely on internal systems and external systems maintained by manufacturers distributors and service providers to take and fulfill customer orders handle customer service requests and host certain online activities any interruption or failure of our internal or external systems could prevent us or our service providers from accepting and fulfilling customer orders or cause company and customer data to be unintentionally disclosed our continuing efforts to upgrade and expand our network security and other information systems could be costly and problems with the design or implementation of system enhancements could harm our business and our results of operations 

our reliance on a limited number of manufacturing and distribution suppliers could harm our business 

we have chosen to outsource the manufacturing and distribution of many of our desktop software products to a small number of third party providers and we use a single vendor to produce and distribute our check and business forms supplies products although our reliance on a small number of suppliers or a single supplier provides us with efficiencies and enhanced bargaining power poor performance by or lack of effective communication with these parties can significantly harm our business this risk is amplified by the fact that we carry very little inventory and rely on justintime manufacturing processes in particular the loss of our principal manufacturing partner for retail would be disruptive to our business and could cause delay in a product launch we seek to mitigate this risk by managing our second tier vendors and maintaining contingency plans if we experience delays during a peak demand period or significant quality issues our business could be significantly harmed 

as our product and service offerings become more complex our revenue streams may become less predictable  

our expanding range of products and services generates more varied revenue streams than our traditional desktop software businesses the accounting policies that apply to these revenue streams are more complex than those that apply to our traditional products and services we expect this trend to continue as we expand our offerings for example as we begin to offer additional features and options as part of multipleelement revenue arrangements we could be required to defer a higher percentage of our product revenue at the time of sale than we do for traditional products this would decrease recognized revenue at the time products are shipped but result in increased recognized revenue in fiscal periods after shipment 

we face a number of risks in our merchant card processing business that could result in a reduction in our revenue and earnings 

our merchant card processing service business is subject to several specific risks including the following 

 

 

should any of these risks be realized our business and financial results would suffer 

risks associated with our financial institutions business may harm our results of operations and financial condition 

in february 2007 we completed the acquisition of digital insight a provider of outsourced online banking services and applications to financial institutions this new financial institutions business is subject to several risks including the following 

 

our dependence on a small number of larger retailers and distributors could harm our results of operations 

we sell most of our desktop software products through our retail distribution channel and a relatively small number of larger retailers and distributors generate a significant portion of our sales volume our principal retailers have significant bargaining leverage due to their size and available resources historically some retailers have elected to offer our tax products exclusively any change in principal business terms loss of exclusivity major disruption or termination of a relationship with these resellers could result in a potentially significant decline in our revenues and earnings the sourcing decisions product display locations and promotional activities that retailers undertake can greatly impact the sales of our products the fact that we also sell our products directly could cause retailers or distributors to reduce their efforts to promote our products or stop selling our products altogether if any of our retailers or distributors experience financial difficulties we may be unable to collect amounts that we are owed at january 31 2007 in the midst of the 2006 consumer tax season amounts due from our 10 largest retailers and distributors represented approximately 57 of total gross accounts receivable 

increased government regulation of our businesses could harm our operating results 

the tax preparation industry has received increased attention from legislative and regulatory bodies in recent years both because of the continuing focus on free tax preparation and because of the nature of certain services used to process and transfer refunds to taxpayers if legislative or regulatory bodies increase their regulation or oversight of the tax preparation industry or restrict the types of products and services that can be offered to consumers this could 

increase our cost of doing business by requiring compliance with new regulations and could limit our revenue opportunities 

we are also required to comply with a variety of state revenue agency standards in order to successfully operate our tax preparation and electronic filing services changes in stateimposed requirements by one or more of the states including the required use of specific technologies or technology standards could significantly increase the costs of providing those services to our customers and could prevent us from delivering a quality product to our customers in a timely manner 

our financial institutions business provides services to banks credit unions and other institutions that are subject to extensive and complex federal and state regulation as a result our financial institution customers require that our products and services comply with the regulations applicable to these customers if we are unable to comply with these regulations we could incur significant costs and penalties face litigation or governmental proceedings and lose our ability to sell to these customers any of these adverse events could harm our results of operations and our reputation in addition as we seek to grow our business we may expand into more highlyregulated areas which will require increased investment in compliance and auditing functions or new technologies in order to meet regulatory standards government authorities could adopt other laws rules or regulations that place new burdens or restrictions on our business or determine that our operations are directly subject to existing rules or regulations such as requirements related to data collection retention and processing which could make our business more costly less efficient or impossible to conduct and could require us to modify our current or future products or services which could harm our operating results 

if we do not respond promptly and effectively to customer service and technical support inquiries we will lose customers and our revenue and earnings will decline 

the effectiveness of our customer service and technical support operations are critical to customer satisfaction and our financial success if we do not respond effectively to service and technical support requests we will lose customers and miss revenue opportunities such as paid service product renewals and new product sales we occasionally experience customer service and technical support problems including longer than expected waiting times for customers when our staffing and systems are inadequate to handle a higherthananticipated volume of requests training and retaining qualified customer service and technical support personnel is particularly challenging due to the expansion of our product offerings and the seasonality of our tax business for example although many of our consumer tax service representatives return each tax season it is challenging to expand the number of representatives from about 150 during offseason months to about 1500 at the peak of the season if we do not adequately train our support representatives our customers will not receive an appropriate level of support we will lose customers and our financial results will suffer 

if we encounter problems with our thirdparty customer service and technical support providers our business and operating results will be harmed 

we outsource a substantial portion of our customer service and technical support activities to domestic and international thirdparty service providers including service providers in india and the philippines and we expect to continue to rely heavily on third parties in the future this strategy provides us with lower operating costs and greater flexibility but also presents risks to our business including the following 

 

 

we are exposed to risks associated with credit card and payment fraud and with credit card processing 

many of our customers use credit cards or automated payment systems to pay for our products and services we have suffered losses and may continue to suffer losses as a result of orders placed with fraudulent credit card or other payment data for example under current credit card practices we may be liable for fraudulent credit card transactions if we do not obtain a cardholder’s signature a frequent practice in internet sales we employ technology solutions to help us detect fraudulent transactions however the failure to detect or control payment fraud could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

we are subject to payment card association operating rules and certification requirements as in effect from time to time failure to comply with these rules or requirements may subject us to fines and higher transaction fees or cause us to lose our ability to accept credit card payments from our customers resulting in harm to our business and results of operations 

if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights competitors may exploit our innovations which could weaken our competitive position and reduce our revenue and earnings 

our success depends upon our proprietary technology we rely on a combination of copyright trade secret trademark patent confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights as part of our confidentiality procedures we generally enter into nondisclosure agreements with our employees contractors distributors and corporate partners and into license agreements with respect to our software documentation and other proprietary information the creation and protection of our proprietary rights are expensive and may require us to engage in costly and distracting litigation despite these precautions third parties could copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology without authorization because we outsource significant aspects of our product development manufacturing and distribution we are at risk that confidential portions of our intellectual property could become public by lapses in security by our contractors we have licensed in the past and expect to license in the future certain of our proprietary rights such as trademarks or copyrighted material to others these licensees may take actions that diminish the value of our proprietary rights or harm our reputation it is also possible that other companies could successfully challenge the validity or scope of our patents and that our patent portfolio which is relatively small may not provide us with adequate protection ultimately our attempts to secure legal protection for our proprietary rights may not be adequate and our competitors could independently develop similar technologies duplicate our products or design around patents and other intellectual property rights if our intellectual property protection proves inadequate we could lose our competitive advantage and our financial results will suffer 

third parties claiming that we infringe their proprietary rights could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and prevent us from selling our products 

from time to time we have received claims that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of others as the number of products in the software industry increases and the functionality of these products further overlap and as we acquire technology through acquisitions or licenses we believe that we may become increasingly subject to infringement claims including patent copyright and trademark infringement claims we expect that software products in general will increasingly be subject to these claims as the number of products and competitors increase the functionality of products overlap and as the patenting of software functionality continues to grow we have from time to time received allegations of patent infringement claims in the past and may receive more claims in the future based on allegations that our products infringe upon patents held by third parties some of these claims are currently the subject of pending litigation against us and against some of our oem customers these claims may involve patent holding companies or other adverse patent owners who have no relevant product revenues of their own and against whom our own patents may provide little or no deterrence future claims could present an exposure of uncertain magnitude the ultimate outcome of any allegation is uncertain and regardless of outcome any such claim with or without merit could be time consuming to defend result in costly litigation divert management’s time and attention from our business require us to stop selling to delay shipping or to redesign our products or require us to pay monetary damages for royalty or licensing arrangements or to satisfy indemnification 

obligations that we have with some of our customers our failure to obtain necessary license or other rights or litigation arising out of intellectual property claims could adversely affect our business 

in addition we license and use software from third parties in our business these third party software licenses may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms also these third parties may from time to time receive claims that they have infringed the intellectual property rights of others including patent and copyright infringement claims which may affect our ability to continue licensing their software our inability to use any of this third party software could result in shipment delays or other disruptions in our business which could materially and adversely affect our operating results 

we expect copying and misuse of our intellectual property to be a persistent problem causing lost revenue and increased expenses 

our intellectual property rights are among our most valuable assets policing unauthorized use and copying of our products is difficult expensive and time consuming current us laws that prohibit copying give us only limited practical protection from software piracy and the laws of many other countries provide very little protection we may not be able to prevent misappropriation of our technology for example we frequently encounter unauthorized copies of our software being sold through online auction sites and other online marketplaces in addition efforts to protect our intellectual property may be misunderstood and perceived negatively by our customers although we continue to evaluate and put in place technology solutions to attempt to lessen the impact of piracy and we continue to increase our civil and criminal enforcement efforts we expect piracy to be a persistent problem that results in lost revenues and increased expenses 

although we are unable to quantify the extent of piracy of our software products software piracy may depress our net revenues we engage in efforts to educate consumers on the benefits of licensing genuine products and to educate lawmakers on the advantages of a business climate where intellectual property rights are protected and we cooperate with the software  information industry association in their efforts to combat piracy however these efforts may not fully combat the effect of piracy of our products 

we do not own all of the software other technologies and content used in our products and services 

many of our products are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties we believe we have all of the necessary licenses from third parties to use and distribute third party technology and content that we do not own that is used in our current products and services from time to time we may be required to renegotiate with these third parties — or negotiate with new third parties — to include their technology or content in our existing products in new versions of our existing products or in wholly new products we may not be able to negotiate or renegotiate licenses on reasonable terms or at all if we are unable to obtain the rights necessary to use or continue to use thirdparty technology or content in our products and services we may not be able to sell the affected products which would in turn have a negative impact on our revenue and operating results 

certain of our offerings include thirdparty software that is licensed under socalled “open source” licenses some of which may include a requirement that under certain circumstances we make available or grant licenses to any modifications or derivative works we create based upon the open source software although we have established internal review and approval processes to mitigate these risks we cannot be sure that all open source software is submitted for approval prior to use in our products many of the risks associated with usage of open source cannot be eliminated and could if not properly addressed harm our business 

our acquisition and divestiture activities could disrupt our ongoing business may involve increased expenses and may present risks not contemplated at the time of the transactions 

we have acquired and may continue to acquire companies products and technologies that complement our strategic direction in february 2007 we completed the acquisition of digital insight for total consideration of approximately 134 billion including the value of assumed vested options acquisitions involve significant risks and uncertainties including 

 

 

acquisitions and divestitures are inherently risky we can not be certain that our previous pending or future transactions will be successful and will not materially adversely affect the conduct operating results or financial condition of our business many transactions are subject to closing conditions which may not be satisfied and transactions may not be successfully completed even after their public announcement we have generally paid cash for our recent acquisitions these transactions may involve further use of our cash resources the issuance of equity or debt securities the incurrence of other forms of debt the amortization of expenses related to intangible assets or potential future impairment charges related to goodwill that we record on our balance sheet which will be subject to annual testing in the future any of which could harm our financial condition and results of operations in particular we allocated a portion of the purchase price for digital insight to goodwill which could be subject to potential future impairment charges and we also allocated a portion of the purchase price to identified intangible assets which we expect to amortize over a period of three to five years further we funded 1 billion of the purchase price of digital insight with the proceeds of senior unsecured notes the use of debt to fund acquisitions or for other purposes significantly increases our interest expense and leverage if we issue equity securities as consideration in an acquisition current shareholders’ percentage ownership and earnings per share may be diluted 

in march 2007 we sold certain assets related to our complete payroll and premier payroll service businesses to adp because the final purchase price is contingent upon the number of customers that transition to adp the final purchase price could be materially less than the maximum purchase price if we do not successfully transition customers we also expect to recognize any gain on the sale of these assets over a period not to exceed one year from the date of sale although adp is obligated to pay us certain fees to service customers prior to their transition to adp our costs to service these customers may exceed those fees 

we have issued 1 billion in a debt offering and may incur other debt in the future which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

in connection with the acquisition of digital insight we have issued 1 billion in senior unsecured notes we have also entered into a 500 million fiveyear revolving credit facility although we have no current plans to request any advances under this credit facility we may use the proceeds of any future borrowing for general corporate purposes or for future acquisitions or expansion of our business 

we have not previously incurred substantial amounts of debt for borrowed money and our incurrence of this debt may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition by among other things 

 

our current revolving credit facility imposes restrictions on us including restrictions on our ability to create liens on our assets and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur indebtedness and require us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios our ability to comply with these ratios may be affected by events beyond our control in addition our longterm nonconvertible debt includes covenants that may adversely affect our ability to incur certain liens or engage in certain types of sale and leaseback transactions if we breach any of the covenants under our longterm debt or our revolving credit facilities and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders then subject to applicable cure periods our outstanding indebtedness could be declared immediately due and payable 

in addition changes by any rating agency to our credit rating can negatively impact the value and liquidity of both our debt and equity securities if our credit ratings are downgraded or other negative action is taken the interest rate payable by us under our revolving credit facility would increase in addition any downgrades in our credit ratings could affect our ability to obtain additional financing in the future and may affect the terms of any such financing 

if actual product returns exceed returns reserves our financial results would be harmed 

we ship more desktop software products to our distributors and retailers than we expect them to sell in order to reduce the risk that distributors or retailers will run out of products this is particularly true for our consumer tax products which have a short selling season and for which returns occur primarily in our fiscal third and fourth quarters like many software companies that sell their products through distributors and retailers we have historically accepted significant product returns we establish reserves against revenue for product returns in our financial statements based on estimated returns and we closely monitor product sales and inventory in the retail channel in an effort to maintain adequate reserves in the past returns have not differed significantly from these reserves however if we experience actual returns that significantly exceed reserves it would result in lower net revenue for example if we had increased our fiscal 2007 returns reserves by 1 of nonconsignment sales to retailers for quickbooks turbotax and quicken our fiscal 2007 total net revenue would have been approximately 33 million lower in addition our policy of recognizing revenue from distributors and retailers upon delivery of product for nonconsignment sales is predicated upon our ability to reasonably estimate returns if we do not continue to demonstrate our ability to estimate returns then our revenue recognition policy for these types of sales may no longer be appropriate 

acquisitionrelated costs and impairment charges can cause significant fluctuation in our net income 

our acquisitions have resulted in significant expenses including amortization and impairment of purchased intangible assets charges for inprocess research and development and impairment of goodwill total acquisitionrelated costs in the categories identified above were 509 million in fiscal 2007 183 million in fiscal 2006 and 218 million in fiscal 2005 although under current accounting rules goodwill is no longer amortized we may incur impairment charges related to the goodwill already recorded and to goodwill arising out of future acquisitions we test the impairment of goodwill annually in our fourth fiscal quarter or more frequently if indicators of impairment arise the timing of the formal annual test may result in charges to our statement of operations in our fourth fiscal quarter that could not have been reasonably foreseen in prior periods at july 31 2007 we had 15 billion in goodwill and 2929 million in net purchased intangible assets on our balance sheet both of which could be subject to impairment charges in the future new acquisitions and any impairment of the value of purchased assets could have a significant negative impact on our future operating results 

if we fail to operate our payroll business effectively our revenue and earnings will be harmed 

our payroll business handles a significant amount of dollar and transaction volume due to the size and volume of transactions that we handle effective processing systems and controls are essential to ensure that transactions are handled appropriately despite our efforts it is possible that we may make errors or that funds may be misappropriated in addition to any direct damages and fines that any such problems would create which could be substantial the loss of customer confidence in our accuracy and controls would seriously harm our business the systems supporting our payroll business are comprised of multiple technology platforms that are difficult to scale we must constantly continue to upgrade our systems and processes to ensure that we process customer data in an accurate reliable and timely manner these upgrades must also meet the various regulatory requirements and deadlines associated with employerrelated payroll activities any failure of our systems or processes in critical switchover times such as in january when many businesses elect to change payroll service providers would be detrimental to our business if we failed to timely deliver any of our payroll products it could cause our current and prospective customers to choose a competitor’s product for that year’s payroll and not to purchase intuit products in the future if these efforts are not successful our revenue growth and profitability will decline 

interest income attributable to payroll customer deposits may fluctuate or be eliminated causing our revenue and earnings to decline 

we currently record revenue from interest earned on customer deposits that we hold pending payment of funds to taxing authorities or to customers’ employees if interest rates decline or there are regulatory changes that diminish the amount of time that we are required or permitted to hold such funds our interest revenue will decline 

we may be unable to attract and retain key personnel 

much of our future success depends on the continued service and availability of skilled personnel including members of our executive team and those in technical marketing and staff positions experienced personnel in the software and services industries are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense especially in silicon valley and san diego california where the majority of our employees are located although we strive to be an employer of choice we may not be able to continue to successfully attract and retain key personnel which would cause our business to suffer 

we are frequently a party to litigation that is costly to defend and consumes the time of our management 

due to our financial position and the large number of customers that we serve we are often forced to defend litigation see item 3 “legal proceedings” for information regarding specific pending litigation defending litigation consumes the time of our management and is expensive for intuit even though we often seek insurance coverage for litigation defense costs there is no assurance that our defense costs which can be substantial will be covered in all cases in addition by its nature litigation is unpredictable and we may not prevail even in cases where we strongly believe a plaintiff’s case has no valid claims if we do not prevail in litigation we may be required to pay substantial monetary damages or alter our business operations regardless of the outcome litigation is expensive and consumes the time of our management and may ultimately reduce our income 

unanticipated changes in our tax rates could affect our future financial results 

our future effective tax rates could be favorably or unfavorably affected by unanticipated changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or by changes in tax laws or their interpretation in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls we may not be able to detect fraud or report our financial results accurately which could harm our business and the trading price of our common stock 

we periodically assess our system of internal controls and the internal controls of service providers upon which we rely to review their effectiveness and identify potential areas of improvement in addition from time to time we acquire businesses many of which have limited infrastructure and systems of internal controls performing assessments of internal controls implementing necessary changes and maintaining an effective controls environment is expensive and requires considerable management attention internal control systems are designed in part upon assumptions about the likelihood of future events and all such systems however well designed and operated can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance that the objectives of the system are met because of the inherent limitations of control systems there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions if we fail to implement and maintain an effective system of internal controls or prevent fraud we could suffer losses could be subject to costly litigation investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information and our brand and operating results could be harmed 

we and our independent registered public accounting firm must certify the adequacy of our internal controls over financial reporting annually identification of material weaknesses in internal controls over financial reporting could harm our business 

business interruptions could adversely affect our future operating results 

several of our major business operations are subject to interruption by earthquake fire power shortages terrorist attacks and other hostile acts and other events beyond our control the majority of our research and development activities our corporate headquarters our principal information technology systems and other critical business operations are located near major seismic faults we do not carry earthquake insurance for direct quakerelated losses while we maintain disaster recovery facilities for key data centers that support the information systems networks and databases that are necessary to operate our business we do not have disaster recovery facilities for all of our data centers our operating results and financial condition could be materially harmed in the event of a major earthquake or other natural or manmade disaster

due to our evolving business needs we have begun executing a plan to build a new data center in washington state to support our longer term hosting requirements in january 2007 we purchased the land on which to build this data center 

we also lease or own facilities in a number of other domestic locations and internationally in canada the united kingdom and several other locations we believe our facilities are adequate for our current and nearterm needs and that we will be able to locate additional facilities as needed see note 10 to the financial statements in item 8 for more information about our lease commitments 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

muriel siebert  co inc v intuit inc index no 03602942 supreme court of the state of new york county of new york 

on september 17 2003 muriel siebert  co inc filed a complaint against intuit alleging various claims for breach of contract breach of express and implied covenants of good faith and fair dealing breach of fiduciary duty misrepresentation andor fraud and promissory estoppel the allegations relate to quicken brokerage powered by siebert a strategic alliance between the two companies the complaint seeks compensatory damages of up to 111 million punitive damages of up to 330 million and other damages intuit unsuccessfully sought to compel the matter to arbitration on february 7 2005 intuit filed a motion to dismiss all but one of the plaintiff’s claims in new york state court on september 6 2005 the court dismissed siebert’s fraud and punitive damages claims on may 8 2007 the court of appeals of the state of new york resolved in intuit’s favor a motion by siebert to disqualify intuit’s counsel and the case is now proceeding again in the trial court no trial date has yet been set intuit believes this lawsuit is without merit and will vigorously defend the litigation 

other litigation matters 

intuit is subject to certain routine legal proceedings as well as demands claims and threatened litigation that arise in the normal course of our business including assertions that we may be infringing patents or other intellectual property rights of others we currently believe that the ultimate amount of liability if any for any pending claims of any type either alone or combined will not materially affect our financial position results of operations or cash flows the ultimate outcome of any litigation is uncertain and regardless of outcome litigation can have an adverse impact on intuit because of defense costs negative publicity diversion of management resources and other factors our failure to obtain necessary license or other rights or litigation arising out of intellectual property claims could adversely affect our business

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda includes the following sections 

 

you should note that this mda discussion contains forwardlooking statements that involve risks and uncertainties please see the section entitled “forwardlooking statements and risk factors” at the beginning of item 1a for important information to consider when evaluating such statements 

you should read this mda in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes in item 8 as discussed below in february 2007 we completed the acquisition of digital insight corporation for a total purchase price of approximately 134 billion accordingly we have included digital insight’s results of operations in our consolidated results of operations from the date of acquisition we have also reclassified our financial statements for all periods presented to reflect certain businesses we have sold as discontinued operations see “results of operations — dispositions and discontinued operations” later in this item 7 for more information unless otherwise noted the following discussion pertains only to our continuing operations 

executive overview 

this overview provides a high level discussion of our operating results and some of the trends that affect our business we believe that an understanding of these trends is important in order to understand our financial results for fiscal 2007 as well as our future prospects this summary is not intended to be exhaustive nor is it intended to be a substitute for the detailed discussion and analysis provided elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

seasonality 

our quickbooks consumer tax and professional tax businesses are highly seasonal some of our other offerings are also seasonal but to a lesser extent revenue from many of our small business software products including quickbooks tends to be at its peak around calendar year end although the timing of new product releases or changes in our offerings can materially shift revenue between quarters sales of income tax preparation products and services are heavily concentrated in the period from november through april in our consumer tax business a greater proportion of our revenue has been occurring later in this seasonal period due in part to the growth in sales of turbotax online for which revenue is recognized upon filing these seasonal patterns mean that our total net revenue is usually highest during our second quarter ending january 31 and third quarter ending april 30 we typically report losses in our first quarter ending october 31 and fourth quarter ending july 31 when revenue from our tax businesses is minimal while operating expenses continue at relatively consistent levels we believe the seasonality of our revenue is likely to continue in the future 

overview of financial results 

total net revenue for fiscal 2007 was 27 billion up 17 compared with fiscal 2006 we acquired digital insight and created a new financial institutions segment in february 2007 excluding revenue from our financial institutions segment fiscal 2007 total net revenue increased 11 compared with fiscal 2006 almost 30 of the fiscal 2007 revenue increase was due to 15 higher revenue in our consumer tax segment our quickbooks segment and our payroll and payments segment each contributed about 15 of the fiscal 2007 revenue increase 

operating income from continuing operations of 6376 million for fiscal 2007 increased 13 compared with 5656 million for fiscal 2006 fiscal 2007 revenue growth was partially offset by higher total operating costs and expenses higher operating expenses in fiscal 2007 reflect our acquisition of digital insight continued investment in research and development for new and existing offerings as well as increases in advertising and other marketing spending to support the launch of our quickbooks and consumer tax offerings the effects of these factors are described in more detail below 

net income from continuing operations of 4435 million for fiscal 2007 increased 16 compared with 3810 million for fiscal 2006 interest expense on the debt we issued in connection with our february 2007 acquisition of digital insight was partially offset by higher interest income we recorded a pretax net gain of 317 million on the sale of certain outsourced payroll assets in fiscal 2007 our effective tax rates for fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 were approximately 36 and 38 diluted net income per share from continuing operations of 125 for fiscal 2007 increased 18 compared with 106 for fiscal 2006 average shares outstanding declined as a result of repurchases of common stock under our stock repurchase programs partially offset by the issuance of shares in connection with our employee stock plans 

on february 6 2007 we completed the acquisition of digital insight for a total purchase price of approximately 134 billion in order to finance a portion of this transaction on february 6 2007 we borrowed 1 billion under a bridge credit facility which we retired on march 12 2007 with the proceeds of our issuance of 1 billion in senior notes we funded the remainder of the purchase price with our existing cash balances our future operating results will reflect interest expense related to the senior notes 

in march 2007 we completed the sale of certain assets related to our complete payroll and premier payroll service businesses to automatic data processing inc adp for a price of up to approximately 135 million in cash the final purchase price is contingent upon the number of customers that transition to adp due to actual customer attrition during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 we currently estimate the maximum sales price to be approximately 120 million we will recognize the gain on the sale of the assets as customers are transitioned pursuant to the agreement over a period not to exceed one year from the date of the sale we recognized a pretax net gain of 317 million on the sale of the assets in fiscal 2007 

in july 2007 we signed a definitive agreement to sell our intuit distribution management solutions idms business the sale was completed in august 2007 for approximately 100 million in cash idms was part of our other businesses segment we have accounted for idms as a discontinued operation and segregated the net assets and operating results of idms from continuing operations for all periods presented we expect to record a gain on the sale of idms in the first quarter of fiscal 2008 

we ended fiscal 2007 with cash and investments totaling 13 billion in fiscal 2007 we generated cash from operations from the issuance of longterm debt and to a lesser extent from the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans during the same period we used cash for the purchase of digital insight and for purchases of property and equipment we also repurchased 171 million shares of our common stock for 5066 million under our stock repurchase programs in fiscal 2007 at july 31 2007 we had authorization from our board to expend 800 million for future stock repurchases 

on march 22 2007 we entered into an agreement with certain institutional lenders for a 500 million unsecured revolving credit facility that will expire on march 22 2012 we may use amounts borrowed under this credit facility for general corporate purposes or for future acquisitions or expansion of our business to date we have not borrowed under the credit facility but we may borrow under the credit facility from time to time as opportunities and needs arise see “liquidity and capital resources — unsecured revolving credit facility” below for more information 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

in preparing our financial statements we make estimates assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on our net revenue operating income or loss and net income or loss as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our balance sheet we believe that the estimates assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies senior management has reviewed the development and selection of these 

critical accounting policies and their disclosure in this annual report on form 10k with the audit committee of our board of directors 

net revenue — revenue recognition 

we derive revenue from the sale of packaged software products license fees software subscriptions product support professional services payroll services merchant services transaction fees and multiple element arrangements that may include any combination of these items we follow the appropriate revenue recognition rules for each type of revenue for additional information see “net revenue” in note 1 to the financial statements in item 8 we generally recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists we have delivered the product or performed the service the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable however determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report for example for multiple element arrangements we must make assumptions and judgments in order to allocate the total price among the various elements we must deliver to determine whether undelivered services are essential to the functionality of the delivered products and services to determine whether vendorspecific evidence of fair value exists for each undelivered element and to determine whether and when each element has been delivered if we were to change any of these assumptions or judgments it could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period amounts for fees collected or invoiced and due relating to arrangements where revenue cannot be recognized are reflected on our balance sheet as deferred revenue and recognized when the applicable revenue recognition criteria are satisfied 

in connection with the sale of certain products we provide a limited amount of free technical support assistance to customers we do not defer the recognition of any revenue associated with sales of these products since the cost of providing this free technical support is insignificant the technical support is generally provided within one year after the associated revenue is recognized and free product enhancements are minimal and infrequent we accrue the estimated cost of providing this free support upon product shipment 

net revenue — return and rebate reserves 

as part of our revenue recognition policy we estimate future product returns and rebate payments and establish reserves against revenue at the time of sale based on these estimates our return policy allows distributors and retailers subject to contractual limitations to return purchased products product returns by distributors and retailers relate primarily to the return of excess and obsolete products in determining our product returns reserves we consider the volume and price mix of products in the retail channel historical return rates for prior releases of the product trends in retailer inventory and economic trends that might impact customer demand for our products including the competitive environment and the timing of new releases of our products we fully reserve for excess and obsolete products in the distribution channels 

our rebate reserves include distributor and retailer sales incentive rebates and enduser rebates our estimated reserves for distributor and retailer incentive rebates are based on distributors’ and retailers’ actual performance against the terms and conditions of rebate programs which we typically establish annually our reserves for enduser rebates are estimated based on the terms and conditions of the specific promotional rebate program actual sales during the promotion and historical redemption trends by product and by type of promotional program 

in the past actual returns and rebates have not differed significantly from the reserves that we have established however actual returns and rebates in any future period are inherently uncertain if we were to change our assumptions and estimates our revenue reserves would change which would impact the net revenue we report if actual returns and rebates are significantly greater than the reserves we have established the actual results would decrease our future reported revenue conversely if actual returns and rebates are significantly less than our reserves this would increase our future reported revenue for example if we had increased our fiscal 2007 returns reserves by 1 of nonconsignment sales to retailers for quickbooks turbotax and quicken our fiscal 2007 total net revenue would have been 33 million lower 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

we make ongoing assumptions relating to the collectibility of our accounts receivable the accounts receivable amount on our balance sheet includes a reserve for accounts that might not be paid in determining the amount of the 

reserve we consider our historical level of credit losses we also make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations and we assess current economic trends that might impact the level of credit losses in the future our reserves have generally been adequate to cover our actual credit losses however since we cannot reliably predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers we cannot guarantee that our reserves will continue to be adequate if actual credit losses are significantly greater than the reserve we have established that would increase our general and administrative expenses and reduce our reported net income conversely if actual credit losses are significantly less than our reserve this would eventually decrease our general and administrative expenses and increase our reported net income 

business combinations – purchase accounting 

under the purchase method of accounting we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values we record the excess of purchase price over the aggregate fair values as goodwill we engage thirdparty appraisal firms to assist us in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed these valuations require us to make significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets critical estimates in valuing purchased technology customer lists and other identifiable intangible assets include future cash flows that we expect to generate from the acquired assets if the subsequent actual results and updated projections of the underlying business activity change compared with the assumptions and projections used to develop these values we could experience impairment charges in addition we have estimated the economic lives of certain acquired assets and these lives are used to calculate depreciation and amortization expense if our estimates of the economic lives change depreciation or amortization expenses could be accelerated or slowed 

goodwill purchased intangible assets and other longlived assets – impairment assessments 

we make judgments about the recoverability of purchased intangible assets and other longlived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an otherthantemporary impairment in the remaining value of the assets recorded on our balance sheet may exist we test the impairment of goodwill annually in our fourth fiscal quarter or more frequently if indicators of impairment arise the timing of the formal annual test may result in charges to our statement of operations in our fourth fiscal quarter that could not have been reasonably foreseen in prior periods in order to estimate the fair value of longlived assets we typically make various assumptions about the future prospects for the business that the asset relates to consider market factors specific to that business and estimate future cash flows to be generated by that business we evaluate cash flows at the lowest operating level and the number of reporting units that we have identified may make impairment more probable than it would be at a company with fewer reporting units and integrated operations following acquisitions based on these assumptions and estimates we determine whether we need to record an impairment charge to reduce the value of the asset stated on our balance sheet to reflect its estimated fair value assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives are complex and often subjective they can be affected by a variety of factors including external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate different assumptions and estimates could materially impact our reported financial results more conservative assumptions of the anticipated future benefits from these businesses could result in impairment charges which would decrease net income and result in lower asset values on our balance sheet conversely less conservative assumptions could result in smaller or no impairment charges higher net income and higher asset values at july 31 2007 we had 15 billion in goodwill and 2929 million in net purchased intangible assets on our balance sheet 

accounting for sharebased compensation plans 

prior to august 1 2005 we accounted for our sharebased employee compensation plans under the measurement and recognition provisions of accounting principles board apb opinion no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” and related interpretations as permitted by financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” we recorded no sharebased employee compensation expense for options granted under our 2005 equity incentive plan or its predecessor plans prior to august 1 2005 as all options granted under those plans had exercise prices equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant we also recorded no compensation expense in connection with our employee stock purchase plan as the purchase price of the stock was not less than 85 of the 

lower of the fair market value of our common stock at the beginning of each offering period or at the end of each purchase period in accordance with sfas 123 and sfas 148 “accounting for stockbased compensation – transition and disclosure” we disclosed our net income or loss and net income or loss per share as if we had applied the fair valuebased method in measuring compensation expense for our sharebased incentive programs 

effective august 1 2005 we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas 123r “sharebased payment” using the modified prospective transition method under that transition method compensation expense that we recognize beginning on that date includes a period compensation expense for all sharebased payments granted prior to but not yet vested as of august 1 2005 based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas 123 adjusted for estimated forfeitures and b period compensation expense for all sharebased payments granted on or after august 1 2005 based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas 123r because we elected to use the modified prospective transition method results for prior periods have not been restated at july 31 2007 there was 1785 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested sharebased compensation arrangements granted under all equity compensation plans which we will amortize to expense in the future total unrecognized compensation cost will be adjusted for future changes in estimated forfeitures we expect to recognize that cost over a weighted average vesting period of 22 years 

effective august 1 2006 we began using a lattice binomial model and the assumptions shown in note 12 to the financial statements in item 8 to estimate the fair value of stock options granted prior to that date we used the black scholes valuation model this change did not have a material impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows our stock options have various restrictions including vesting provisions and restrictions on transfer and are often exercised prior to their contractual maturity we therefore believe that lattice binomial models are more capable of incorporating the features of our stock options than closedform models such as the black scholes model beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 we estimated the expected term of options granted based on implied exercise patterns using a binomial model prior to that we estimated the expected term of options granted based on historical exercise patterns we estimate the volatility of our common stock at the date of grant based on the implied volatility of publicly traded oneyear and twoyear options on our common stock consistent with sfas 123r and securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 107 our decision to use implied volatility was based upon the availability of actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility we base the riskfree interest rate that we use in our option valuation model on the implied yield in effect at the time of option grant on constant maturity us treasury issues with equivalent remaining terms we have never paid any cash dividends on our common stock and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future consequently we use an expected dividend yield of zero in our option valuation model sfas 123r requires us to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates we use historical data to estimate prevesting option forfeitures and record sharebased compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest for options granted before august 1 2005 we amortize the fair value on an accelerated basis this is the same basis on which we amortized options granted before august 1 2005 for our pro forma disclosures under sfas 123 for options granted on or after august 1 2005 we amortize the fair value on a straightline basis all options are amortized over the requisite service periods of the awards which are generally the vesting periods we may elect to use different assumptions under our option valuation model in the future which could materially affect our net income or loss and net income or loss per share 

legal contingencies 

we are subject to certain legal proceedings as well as demands claims and threatened litigation that arise in the normal course of our business we review the status of each significant matter quarterly and assess our potential financial exposure if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated we record a liability and an expense for the estimated loss significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination of whether an exposure is reasonably estimable our accruals are based on the best information available at the time as additional information becomes available we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates potential legal liabilities and the revision of estimates of potential legal liabilities could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 

income taxes – estimates of effective tax rates deferred taxes and valuation allowance 

when we prepare our financial statements we estimate our income taxes based on the various jurisdictions where we conduct business significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision we recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the united states and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes will be due we record an additional amount in our provision for income taxes in the period in which we determine that our recorded tax liability is less than we expect the ultimate tax assessment to be if in a later period we determine that payment of this additional amount is unnecessary we reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit in that later period as a result our ongoing assessments of the probable outcomes of the audit issues and related tax positions require judgment and can materially increase or decrease our effective tax rate and materially affect our operating results this also requires us to estimate our current tax exposure and to assess temporary differences that result from differing treatments of certain items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which we show on our balance sheet we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized to the extent we believe that realization is not likely we establish a valuation allowance when we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in an accounting period we record a corresponding tax expense in our statement of operations 

our net deferred tax asset at july 31 2007 was 1567 million net of the valuation allowance of 25 million we recorded the valuation allowance to reflect uncertainties about whether we will be able to utilize some of our deferred tax assets consisting primarily of certain state net operating loss carryforwards before they expire the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income for the jurisdictions in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be realizable while we have considered future taxable income in assessing the need for the valuation allowance we could be required to increase the valuation allowance to take into account additional deferred tax assets that we may be unable to realize an increase in the valuation allowance would have an adverse impact which could be material on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which we make the increase 

results of operations 

financial overview 

 

total net revenue increased 3799 million or 17 in fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006 total net revenue was higher in fiscal 2007 due to our february 2007 acquisition of digital insight to revenue growth in our consumer tax segment and to a lesser extent to revenue growth in our quickbooks segment and our payroll and payments segment revenue from our financial institutions segment which includes digital insight was 1504 million in fiscal 2007 compared with 244 million in fiscal 2006 consumer tax revenue increased 1068 million or 15 in fiscal 2007 due to 16 growth in federal online units excluding units donated through the free file alliance and to price increases quickbooks segment revenue increased 593 million or 11 in fiscal 2007 due to unit growth and favorable product mix payroll and payments revenue increased 546 million or 12 in fiscal 2007 due to growth in the quickbooks payroll and the payments customer bases favorable payroll product mix and higher transaction 

volume per customer in our payments business see “total net revenue by business segment” below for more information 

higher revenue in fiscal 2007 was partially offset by higher expenses including increases compared with fiscal 2006 of approximately 87 million for product development expenses approximately 85 million for advertising and other selling and marketing expenses and approximately 80 million for cost of revenue associated with our revenue growth see “operating expenses” below for more information 

net income from continuing operations increased 625 million or 16 in fiscal 2007 interest expense on the debt we issued in connection with our february 2007 acquisition of digital insight of 271 million was partially offset by 130 million higher interest income in fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006 interest income increased in fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006 due to higher interest rates and higher average invested balances we recorded a pretax net gain of 317 million on the sale of certain outsourced payroll assets in fiscal 2007 our effective tax rates for fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 were approximately 36 and 38 see income taxes later in this item 7 for more information 

diluted net income per share from continuing operations increased 18 to 125 in fiscal 2007 compared with 106 in fiscal 2006 average shares outstanding declined during fiscal 2007 as a result of repurchases of 171 million shares of common stock under our stock repurchase programs partially offset by the issuance of 121 million shares in connection with our employee stock plans 

at july 31 2007 our cash cash equivalents and investments totaled 13 billion an increase of 1065 million from july 31 2006 in fiscal 2007 we generated 7268 million in cash from our continuing operations and received approximately 1 billion in cash from the issuance of longterm debt and 2114 million in cash from the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans during the same period we used approximately 12 billion in cash for the purchase of digital insight net of cash acquired and 1532 million in cash for purchases of property and equipment and capitalization of internal use software we also repurchased 171 million shares of our common stock for 5066 million under our stock repurchase programs during fiscal 2007 at july 31 2007 we had authorization from our board to expend 800 million for future stock repurchases 

total net revenue 

the table below and the discussion of net revenue by business segment that follows it are organized in accordance with our six reportable business segments see note 8 to the financial statements in item 8 for descriptions of product revenue and service and other revenue for each segment 

in february 2007 we completed the acquisition of digital insight a provider of outsourced online banking applications and services to banks and credit unions we combined digital insight with our existing financial institutions group which had been part of our other businesses segment to create a new financial institutions segment during fiscal 2007 we have reclassified our existing financial institutions business from our other businesses segment to our financial institutions segment for all periods presented we have also reclassified segment results for all periods presented to reflect the transfer of our mycorporation business from our consumer tax segment to our quickbooks segment mycorporation revenue was 79 million in fiscal 2007 and 44 million in fiscal 2006 mycorporation revenue was not significant in fiscal 2005 

 

total net revenue by business segment 

quickbooks 

fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006  quickbooks segment net revenue increased 593 million or 11 in fiscal 2007 compared with 2006 total quickbooks software unit sales were 10 higher in fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006 due in part to new promotions including our firstever quickbooks television advertisements revenue 

growth in fiscal 2007 was also driven by favorable product mix with quickbooks premier units increasing 25 in fiscal 2007 

fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005  quickbooks segment net revenue increased 359 million or 7 in fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005 total quickbooks software unit sales were up 14 in fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005 this higher unit volume more than offset lower average selling prices for quickbooks software due to price reductions for new users and the elimination of upgrade rebates we believe that the higher unit volume was a result of product improvements successful execution of our quickbooks 2006 product launch and growth in the category that was driven by publicity surrounding a significant new market entrant 

payroll and payments 

fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006 payroll and payments net revenue increased 546 million or 12 in fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006 in our payments business merchant services revenue increased 36 in fiscal 2007 due to 22 growth in the customer base and 9 higher transaction volume per customer merchant services revenue slowed in fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006 due to new customer acquisition remaining relatively constant on a larger customer base small business payroll revenue grew 3 in fiscal 2007 due to 4 growth in the customer base and to a lesser extent to favorable product mix that resulted in higher revenue per customer we estimate that revenue growth in our payroll and payments segment in fiscal 2007 would have been approximately 16 if the sale of portions of our complete payroll and premier payroll services customer base to adp had not occurred 

fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005  payroll and payments net revenue increased 903 million or 24 in fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005 our combined payroll offerings accounted for slightly more than half of the fiscal 2006 revenue increase while our merchant services represented slightly less than half of the revenue increase quickbooks payroll revenue was 23 higher in fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005 because of a combination of favorable product mix 7 growth in the customer base and the residual effects of a price increase that we implemented in fiscal 2005 revenue from our other payroll offerings increased 11 in fiscal 2006 driven by 17 growth in the number of quickbooks assisted payroll and complete payroll customers processing payrolls price increases and increased interest income on funds held for payroll customers partially offset by attrition in the premier payroll service customer base merchant services revenue increased 47 in fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005 due to 32 growth in the customer base and 18 higher transaction volume per customer 

consumer tax 

fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006 consumer tax net revenue increased 1068 million or 15 in 2007 compared with fiscal 2006 due to 16 growth in federal online units excluding units donated through the free file alliance and to price increases consumer tax net revenue for fiscal 2007 included the impact of approximately 9 million in refunds to customers who experienced delays in electronically preparing or filing their income tax returns on april 17 2007 we believe that the continuing trend among individual taxpayers toward the use of software rather than manual methods to prepare their own income tax returns will continue to be important to the growth of our consumer tax business 

fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005 consumer tax net revenue increased 1354 million or 24 in fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005 paid federal turbotax unit sales were up 20 in fiscal 2006 driven by a 57 increase in federal turbotax online units sold which accounted for the majority of the revenue increase for that period to a lesser extent higher fiscal 2006 revenue was due to growth in revenue from attach services such as electronic filing we believe that fiscal 2006 consumer tax revenue growth was positively affected by changes in our offering and pricing strategies that included eliminating rebates and bundling federal and state consumer tax products these changes were designed to simplify our offerings in response to customer feedback 

professional tax 

fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006 professional tax net revenue increased 188 million or 7 in fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006 due to addon product penetration and price increases 

fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005 professional tax net revenue increased 79 million or 3 in fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005 due to overall growth in the professional tax customer base that was partially offset by a shift in product mix toward our lower priced offerings 

financial institutions 

fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006 financial institutions net revenue increased 1260 million to 1504 million in fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006 due almost entirely to our february 2007 acquisition of digital insight 

other businesses 

fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006 other businesses net revenue increased 144 million or 5 in fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006 quicken revenue was flat while revenue from our business in canada increased 11 and revenue from our intuit real estate solutions business grew 28 

fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005 other businesses total net revenue increased 251 million or 10 in fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005 quicken revenue was slightly lower in fiscal 2006 canadian revenue increased 23 in fiscal 2006 due to strong growth in sales of quickbooks products and to a lesser extent to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 

cost of revenue 

 

our cost of revenue has three components 1 cost of product revenue which includes the direct costs of manufacturing and shipping our software products 2 cost of service and other revenue which reflects direct costs associated with providing services including data center costs related to delivering internetbased services and costs associated with revenue sharing and online transactions revenue 3 amortization of purchased intangible assets which represents the cost of amortizing over their useful lives developed technologies that we obtained through acquisitions 

fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006 cost of service and other revenue as a percentage of service and other revenue increased slightly to 25 in fiscal 2007 from 24 in fiscal 2006 the impact of growth in turbotax online and electronic tax filing services which have relatively lower costs of revenue was offset by the impact of our acquisition of digital insight which has relatively higher costs of revenue amortization of purchased intangible assets increased in fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006 due to the amortization of digital insight purchased intangible assets that we acquired in february 2007 

fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005 cost of product revenue as a percentage of product revenue decreased to 12 in fiscal 2006 compared with 13 in fiscal 2005 growth in turbotax units came disproportionately through our web turbotax offer which had lower costs per unit than our desktop offerings this was partially offset by higher cost of product revenue in our quickbooks segment which resulted from 14 quickbooks unit growth cost of service and other revenue as a percentage of service and other revenue decreased to 24 in fiscal 2006 from 26 in fiscal 2005 growth in our consumer tax electronic filing revenue assisted payroll revenue and merchant 

services revenue all of which had lower relative cost increases associated with their related revenue increases was mostly offset by higher costs in our quickbooks segment which resulted from improvements in service levels for technical support plan customers 

operating expenses 

 

fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006 individually and in the aggregate operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenue were generally consistent in fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006 total operating expenses in dollars increased 2059 million in fiscal 2007 approximately 60 million of which was due to our february 2007 acquisition of digital insight 

including digital insight approximately 42 of the fiscal 2007 increase in total operating expenses was due to higher research and development expenses during fiscal 2007 we continued to invest in research and development for existing offerings as well as for new offerings approximately 41 of the fiscal 2007 increase in total operating expenses was due to higher selling and marketing expenses that included increases in radio television and online advertising expenses for our consumer tax and quickbooks offerings as well as additional investments in direct marketing and product management acquisitionrelated charges increased in fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006 due to the amortization of digital insight purchased intangible assets that we acquired in february 2007 

fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005 individually and in the aggregate operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenue were generally consistent in fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005 total operating expenses in dollars increased 2154 million in fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005 sharebased compensation expense for stock options and our employee stock purchase plan that we recorded as a result of our adoption of sfas 123r on august 1 2005 accounted for approximately 63 million of that increase in fiscal 2006 total operating expenses also increased by approximately 75 million for new product development and approximately 60 million for additional advertising and other marketing programs and improved customer support service levels particularly in our quickbooks and consumer tax segments excluding the impact of sharebased compensation expense sales and marketing expense as a percentage of revenue declined due to lower direct selling costs associated with our fiscal 2006 focus on the retail channel 

segment operating income loss 

segment operating income or loss is segment net revenue less segment cost of revenue and operating expenses segment expenses do not include certain costs such as corporate general and administrative expenses and sharebased compensation expenses which are not allocated to specific segments these unallocated costs totaled 5062 million in fiscal 2007 4652 million in fiscal 2006 and 3830 million in fiscal 2005 sharebased compensation expenses for stock options and our employee stock purchase plan that we began recording in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 accounted for 650 million of the increase in unallocated costs for fiscal 2006 see note 1 and note 12 to the financial statements in item 8 segment expenses also do not include amortization of purchased intangible 

assets acquisitionrelated charges and impairment of goodwill and purchased intangible assets in addition segment expenses do not include interest expense interest and other income and realized net gains or losses on marketable equity securities and other investments see note 8 to the financial statements in item 8 for reconciliations of total segment operating income to income from continuing operations for each fiscal year presented 

 

quickbooks 

fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006 quickbooks segment operating income as a percentage of related revenue was approximately the same in fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 the 593 million growth in quickbooks segment revenue in fiscal 2007 was partially offset by higher expenses including increases of approximately 11 million for cost of revenue approximately 16 million for selling and marketing expenses which consisted primarily of higher radio and television advertising expenses and additional investments in direct marketing and product management and approximately 18 million for product development expenses in fiscal 2007 

fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005 quickbooks segment operating income as a percentage of related revenue decreased to 31 in fiscal 2006 from 40 in fiscal 2005 higher fiscal 2006 quickbooks revenue resulted from higher unit volume that more than offset the impact of lower average selling prices however lower average selling prices yielded lower profit per unit higher unit volume in fiscal 2006 also resulted in higher customer support costs we also spent more on quickbooks product development and on improvements to technical support service levels in fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005 

payroll and payments 

fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006 payroll and payments segment operating income as a percentage of related revenue increased to 42 in fiscal 2007 from 39 in fiscal 2006 most of the fiscal 2007 revenue growth in this segment came from products and services with relatively lower costs of revenue such as quickbooks payroll assisted payroll and merchant services the 546 million higher payroll and payments revenue in fiscal 2007 was partially offset by higher expenses including increases of approximately 7 million for product development expenses approximately 5 million for selling and marketing expenses and approximately 6 million for general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2007 

fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005 payroll and payments segment operating income as a percentage of related revenue increased to 39 in fiscal 2006 from 36 in fiscal 2005 more of the fiscal 2006 revenue growth in this segment came from products and services with relatively lower costs of revenue such as quickbooks payroll and merchant services

fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005 consumer tax segment operating income as a percentage of related revenue was approximately the same in fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 higher revenue and lower rebate processing fees were partially offset by higher expenses for television and web advertising and to a lesser extent for product development and customer support in fiscal 2006 

professional tax 

fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006 professional tax segment operating income as a percentage of related revenue increased to 52 in fiscal 2007 from 50 in fiscal 2006 professional tax revenue increased 188 million while expenses were relatively stable in fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006 

fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005 professional tax segment operating income as a percentage of related revenue was the same in fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 revenue and operating expenses were similar in the two periods 

financial institutions 

fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006 financial institutions segment operating income as a percentage of related revenue decreased to 26 in fiscal 2007 from 50 in fiscal 2006 the change in segment operating income structure is due to our february 2007 acquisition of digital insight which we combined with our existing financial institutions business to create a new financial institutions segment this new segment is significantly larger and has higher costs than the intuit financial institutions business that preceded it 

other businesses 

fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006 other businesses segment operating income as a percentage of related revenue increased to 33 in fiscal 2007 from 29 in fiscal 2006 the fiscal 2007 improvement in segment operating income as a percentage of related revenue was due to the may 2006 sale of our masterbuilder business which had relatively low operating margins 

fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005 other businesses segment operating income as a percentage of related revenue was nearly the same in fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 quicken revenue was slightly lower while expenses to develop and market new offerings increased in fiscal 2006 higher revenue combined with relatively stable spending produced better operating margins in canada 

nonoperating income and expenses 

interest expense 

in order to finance a portion of our acquisition of digital insight on february 6 2007 we borrowed 1 billion under a bridge credit facility which we retired on march 12 2007 with the proceeds of our issuance of 1 billion in senior notes interest expense for fiscal 2007 included interest on the 1 billion bridge credit facility at 577 while it was outstanding interest on 500 million in principal amount of the senior notes at 540 and interest on 500 million in principal amount of the senior notes at 575 the senior notes are due in march 2012 and march 2017 and are redeemable by intuit at any time subject to a makewhole premium we are amortizing a total of 73 million in debt issuance costs to interest expense over the terms of the related senior notes 

interest and other income 

 

higher interest rates and higher average invested balances resulted in increases in interest income in fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006 and in fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005 total interest and other income for all periods presented included royalties and fees from trademark license and distribution agreements that we entered into when we sold our quicken loans mortgage business in july 2002 

income taxes 

our effective tax rate was approximately 36 for fiscal 2007 approximately 38 for fiscal 2006 and approximately 33 for fiscal 2005 our effective tax rate for fiscal 2007 differed from the federal statutory rate of 35 due to state income taxes which were partially offset by the benefit we received from tax exempt interest income federal and state research and experimental credits and the domestic production activities deduction in addition in fiscal 2007 we benefited from the retroactive extension of the federal research and experimental credit as it related to fiscal 2006 our effective tax rate for fiscal 2006 differed from the federal statutory rate of 35 due to state income taxes and the taxable gain on the sale of our master builder business which were partially offset by the benefit we received from tax exempt interest income federal and state research and experimental credits and the domestic production activities deduction our effective tax rate for fiscal 2005 differed from the federal statutory rate of 35 due to the net effect of the reversal of 257 million in reserves related to potential income tax exposures that were resolved the federal research and experimental credit and to the benefit received from taxexempt interest income offset by state taxes see note 11 to the financial statements in item 8 

in december 2006 the tax relief and health care act of 2006 was signed into law the act includes a reinstatement of the federal research and experimental credit retroactive to january 1 2006 we recorded a discrete tax benefit of 37 million for the retroactive amount related to fiscal 2006 during the second quarter of fiscal 2007 the credit as reinstated has an expiration date of december 31 2007 

we acquired digital insight on february 6 2007 see note 6 to the financial statements in item 8 digital insight had approximately 76 million in federal net operating loss carryforwards at the date of acquisition we have recorded the tax effects of these carryforwards and other federal tax credit carryforwards which together totaled 344 million as deferred tax assets at the date of acquisition the carryforwards will not result in an income tax provision benefit but they will reduce income taxes payable and cash paid for income taxes as they are utilized at july 31 2007 we had total federal net operating loss carryforwards and federal tax credit carryforwards of 253 million and 49 million 

at july 31 2007 we had net deferred tax assets of 1567 million which included a valuation allowance of 25 million for certain state net operating loss carryforwards the allowance reflects management’s assessment that we may not receive the benefit of loss carryforwards in certain state jurisdictions while we believe our current valuation allowance is sufficient it may be necessary to increase this amount if it becomes more likely that we will not realize a greater portion of the net deferred tax assets we assess the need for an adjustment to the valuation allowance on a quarterly basis see note 11 to the financial statements in item 8 

dispositions and discontinued operations 

during fiscal 2007 2006 and 2005 we sold the assets and businesses described below see note 7 to the financial statements in item 8 for a more complete description of these dispositions and discontinued operations and for a summary of the impact that discontinued operations have had on our statements of operations for those fiscal years

sfas 157 “fair value measurements” 

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas 157 “fair value measurements” sfas 157 provides enhanced guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities the standard also responds to investors’ requests for expanded information about the extent to which companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value the information used to measure fair value and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings sfas 157 applies whenever other standards require or permit assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value this standard does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances sfas 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 which means that it will be effective for our fiscal year beginning august 1 2008 we are in the process of evaluating this standard and therefore have not yet determined the impact that the adoption of sfas 157 will have on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

sfas 159 “the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities” 

in february 2007 the fasb issued sfas 159 “the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities” sfas 159 provides companies with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value the standard’s objective is to reduce both complexity in accounting for financial instruments and the volatility in earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently the standard requires companies to provide additional information that will help investors and other users of financial statements to more easily understand the effect of the company’s choice to use fair value on its earnings it also requires companies to display the fair value of those assets and liabilities for which the company has chosen to use fair value on the face of the balance sheet the new standard does not eliminate disclosure requirements included in other accounting standards including requirements for disclosures about fair value measurements included in sfas 157 “fair value measurements” and sfas 107 “disclosures about fair value of financial instruments” sfas 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 which means that it will be effective for our fiscal year beginning august 1 2008 we are in the process of evaluating this standard and therefore have not yet determined the impact that the adoption of sfas 159 will have on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

investment portfolio 

we do not hold derivative financial instruments in our portfolio of investments and funds held for payroll customers our investments and funds held for payroll customers consist of instruments that meet quality standards consistent with our investment policy this policy specifies that except for direct obligations of the united states government securities issued by agencies of the united states government and money market or cash management funds we diversify our holdings by limiting our investments and funds held for payroll customers with any individual issuer 

the following table presents our portfolio of cash equivalents and investments as of july 31 2007 by stated maturity the table is classified by the original maturity date listed on the security and includes cash equivalents and investments that are part of funds held for payroll customers on our balance sheet cash equivalents consist primarily of money market funds approximately 94 of our availableforsale debt securities have an interest reset date put date or mandatory call date within one year at july 31 2007 the weighted average interest rate earned on our money market accounts was 552 and the weighted average tax adjusted interest rate earned on our investments was 620 

 

interest rate risk 

our cash equivalents and our portfolio of investments and funds held for payroll customers are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates interest rate movements affect the interest income we earn on cash equivalents investments and funds held for payroll customers and the value of those investments should the federal reserve target rate increase by 10 or about 53 basis points from the level of july 31 2007 the value of our investments and funds held for payroll customers would decline by approximately 10 million should interest rates increase by 100 basis points from the level of july 31 2007 the value of our investments and funds held for payroll customers would decline by approximately 19 million 

we are also exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates as they affect our 500 million revolving credit facility advances under the credit facility accrue interest at rates that are equal to citibank’s base rate or the london interbank offered rate libor plus a margin that ranges from 018 to 0575 based on our senior debt credit ratings consequently our interest expense would fluctuate with changes in the general level of these interest rates if we were to borrow any amounts under the credit facility at july 31 2007 no amounts were outstanding under the credit facility 

in connection with our acquisition of digital insight on march 12 2007 we issued 500 million of 540 senior unsecured notes due on march 15 2012 and 500 million of 575 senior unsecured notes due on march 15 2017 since these senior notes bear interest at fixed rates they are not subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates 

impact of foreign currency rate changes 

the functional currency of our international operating subsidiaries is the local currency assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date revenue costs and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange in effect during the period we report translation gains and losses as a 

separate component of stockholders’ equity we include net gains and losses resulting from foreign exchange transactions in our statements of operations 

since we translate foreign currencies primarily canadian dollars british pounds and indian rupees into us dollars for financial reporting purposes currency fluctuations can have an impact on our financial results the historical impact of currency fluctuations has generally been immaterial we believe that our exposure to currency exchange fluctuation risk is not significant primarily because our global subsidiaries invoice customers and satisfy their financial obligations almost exclusively in their local currencies although the impact of currency fluctuations on our financial results has generally been immaterial in the past and we believe that for the reasons cited above currency fluctuations will not be significant in the future there can be no guarantee that the impact of currency fluctuations will not be material in the future as of july 31 2007 we did not engage in foreign currency hedging activities

product development 

since the personal computer and software industries are characterized by rapid technological change shifting customer needs and frequent new product introductions and enhancements a continuous high level of investment is required for the enhancement of existing products and the development of new products we develop the majority of our products internally we may also supplement our internal development efforts by acquiring strategically important products and technology from third parties or establishing other relationships that enable us to enhance or expand our offerings more rapidly we have a number of united states patents and pending applications that relate to various aspects of our products and technology while we believe that our patents have value no single patent is essential to any of our business segments 

our core desktop software products – quickbooks turbotax lacerte proseries and quicken – tend to have fairly predictable structured development cycles of about a year with annual product releases these businesses also develop new products whose development cycles are less predictable developing consumer and professional tax software presents unique challenges because of the demanding development cycle required to accurately incorporate tax law and tax form changes within a rigid timetable the development timing for our other small business offerings varies with business needs and regulatory requirements and the length of the development cycle depends on the scope and complexity of each particular project 

we continue to make substantial investments in research and development our future research and development efforts will be focused on developing new products and services to address customer needs in existing and new markets as well as adding complementary products and services to drive revenue from our core products we anticipate that the products we develop in the future will offer increased ease of use be customized for specific customer categories be webintegrated or webbased and feature improved integration with other intuit and third party products and services and with our internal information systems we also expect to continue to focus significant research and development efforts on multiyear projects to modernize the technology platforms for many of our products our research and development expenses were 3990 million or 17 of total net revenue in fiscal 2006 3052 million or 15 of total net revenue in fiscal 2005 and 2760 million or 15 of total net revenue in fiscal 2004 we expect that our fiscal 2007 research and development expenses as a percentage of total net revenue will be higher than they were in fiscal 2006 

seasonality 

our quickbooks consumer tax and professional tax businesses are highly seasonal some of our other offerings are also seasonal but to a lesser extent revenue from many of our small business software products including quickbooks tends to be concentrated around calendar year end sales of income tax preparation products and services are heavily concentrated in the period from november through april as a result our total net revenue is usually highest during our second quarter ending january 31 and third quarter ending april 30 we typically report losses in our first quarter ending october 31 and fourth quarter ending july 31 when revenue from our tax businesses is minimal while operating expenses continue at relatively consistent levels 

marketing sales and distribution 

markets 

our primary target markets are small businesses consumers and accountants many of the markets in which we compete are characterized by rapid technological change shifting customer needs and frequent new product introductions and enhancements by competitors market and industry changes can quickly render existing products and services obsolete so our success depends on our ability to respond rapidly to these changes with new business models updated competitive strategies new or enhanced products and services alternative distribution methods and other changes in the way we do business 

marketing programs 

we use a variety of marketing programs to generate software orders stimulate demand and generally maintain and increase customer awareness of our products and services these programs include directresponse mail and email campaigns web marketing including purchasing key words from major search engine companies telephone solicitations newspaper and magazine advertising and television and radio advertising we also use workflowintegrated inproduct messaging in some of our software products to market other related products and services including thirdparty products and services customers who respond to direct marketing campaigns and inproduct messaging can purchase products and services from us by telephone through our web sites or through our retail partners 

sales and distribution channels 

direct sales channel  we sell many of our products and services directly to our customers through our web sites and call centers 

retail distribution channel  we market our quickbooks turbotax and quicken desktop software at retail in the united states by selling directly and through distributors to office supply superstores warehouse clubs consumer electronics retailers general mass merchandisers ecommerce companies and catalogers in canada and other international markets we also rely on distributors and other third parties who sell products into the retail channel 

we continue to benefit from strong relationships with a number of major north american retailers which allows us to minimize our dependence on any specific retailer we deliver products to larger retailers through a combination of direct to store deliveries and shipments to central warehouse locations we also sell and ship products for many of our smaller retail customers through distributors see “manufacturing and distribution” later in this item 1 we continue to aggressively manage our inventory to optimize instock presence and ensure good product placement within retail stores in response to current retail trends we are also placing a greater proportion of inventory with retailers on a consignment basis 

as we continue to execute on the right for me strategy in each of our businesses we are in some product areas offering software products that are more complex and have higher prices than our traditional retail software products our recent tailoring of some of these software products to specific customer needs including industryspecific versions of quickbooks is also resulting in a greater number of intuit products we produce and place instore displays and other retail merchandising aids that educate customers about product functionality and benefits 

oem channel  through our relationships with selected personal computer “original equipment manufacturers” or oems we sell software to customers purchasing new oem systems and we sell products offered by oems to their customers after the point of sale although aggregate revenue from our oem channel is much less significant than revenue from our other distribution channels oem relationships help us to attract new customers and generate sales of our core desktop software products 

thirdparty “valueadded” distribution arrangements  we supplement our direct sales capabilities and our retail and oem distribution relationships with selected thirdparty distribution arrangements we believe these relationships will enhance the growth opportunities for certain product and service offerings by allowing us to benefit from the valueadded marketing and sales expertise of these third parties for example our innovative merchant solutions merchant services business participates in a limited liability company that acquires merchant customers for ims see note 1 to the financial statements during fiscal 2007 and beyond we expect to continue to optimize expand and support our network of thirdparty relationships 

competition 

overview 

we face intense competition in all of our businesses both domestically and internationally competitive interest and expertise in many of the markets we serve particularly small business and consumer tax has grown markedly over the past few years and we expect this trend to continue some of our existing competitors have significantly greater 

financial technical and marketing resources than we do as we implement our customerdriven strategies we face increased competitive threats from larger companies than we have historically faced in addition the competitive landscape can shift rapidly as new companies enter markets in which we compete 

our most obvious competition comes from other companies that offer technology solutions similar to ours however for many of our products and services other important competitive alternatives for customers are manual tools and processes or generalpurpose software many of our new customers have used pencil and paper or software such as word processors and spreadsheets rather than competitors’ software and services to perform financial tasks for example many taxpayers prepared their tax returns manually before using turbotax a large number of small businesses used spreadsheets to keep their books and they processed their payroll using spreadsheets and manuallywritten checks before purchasing quickbooks and most of our personal finance customers tracked their finances with spreadsheets manually or not at all before using quicken 

competition specific to business segments 

small business quickbooks is the leading product in the retail sales channel for its category we face significant competitive challenges in our quickbooks and payroll and payments businesses from microsoft corporation which in september 2005 launched accounting software and associated services that directly target small business customers increasingly our small business products and services also face competition from free online banking and payment services offered by financial institutions and others in our merchant services business we also compete directly with a number of independent sales organizations none of which dominates the market 

consumer tax  in the private sector we face intense competition primarily from hr block the makers of taxcut software and increasingly from webbased offerings such as 2nd story software’s taxact where we are subject to significant and increasing price pressure we also compete for customers with lowcost assisted tax preparation businesses such as hr block 

we also face potential competitive challenges in our consumer tax business from publicly funded government entities that offer electronic tax preparation and filing services at no cost to individual taxpayers we are a member of the free file alliance a consortium of private sector companies that signed an agreement with the federal government in october 2002 that was renewed for four years in october 2005 under this agreement a number of private sector companies rather than the federal government have been providing webbased federal tax preparation and filing services at no cost to eligible federal taxpayers through initiatives such as our intuit tax freedom project twentyone states have also adopted free file alliance publicprivate agreements twenty other states offer some form of direct government tax preparation and filing services free to qualified taxpayers we continue to actively work with others in the private and public sectors to advance the goals of the free file alliance policy initiative and to support successful publicprivate partnerships however future administrative regulatory or legislative activity in this area could have a material adverse effect on our consumer tax business 

the following table shows the significant competitors for each of our major products and services 

 

competitive factors 

competitive factors for desktop software  we believe the most important competitive factors for our core desktop software products – quickbooks turbotax lacerte proseries and quicken – are ease of use product features size of the installed customer base brand name recognition value and product and support quality access to distribution channels is also important for our quickbooks turbotax and quicken products in addition the ability for customers to upgrade within product families as their businesses grow is a significant competitive factor for our quickbooks products productivity is also an important competitive factor for the fullservice accounting firms to which we market our lacerte products we believe we compete effectively on these factors as quickbooks turbotax and quicken products are the leading products in the retail sales channel for their respective categories 

competitive factors for products and services other than desktop software  we believe the most important competitive factors for products and services other than desktop software are features and ease of use the integration of these products and services with related desktop software brand name recognition speed in getting new products and services to market effective distribution and quality of implementation and support we believe we compete effectively on these factors for our service offerings such as small business payroll and merchant services service reliability and scalability of operations are also important factors due to the size of our principal competitors in these service businesses we will need to scale our businesses to compete effectively over the long term significant competitive factors for our financial supplies business include ordering convenience product quality speed of delivery and price we believe that our convenient access to our large quickbooks and quicken customer bases is a significant competitive advantage for our financial supplies business 

customer service and technical support 

we provide customer service and technical support by telephone online chat fax email and our customer service and technical support web sites we have fulltime and outsourced customer service and technical support staffs which we supplement with seasonal employees and additional outsourcing during periods of peak call volumes such as during the tax return filing season or following a major product launch we outsource to several firms domestically and internationally most of our internationally outsourced consumer and small business customer service and technical support personnel are located in india and the philippines 

we offer free selfhelp information through our technical support web sites for quickbooks turbotax and quicken for example customers can use our web sites to find answers to commonly asked questions and check on the status of orders under certain support plans customers can also use our web sites to receive product updates electronically support alternatives and fees vary by product we also sponsor online user communities where customers can share product advice with each other 

manufacturing and distribution 

desktop software and supplies 

the major steps involved in manufacturing desktop software are manufacturing cds printing boxes and related materials and assembling and shipping the final products we have a manufacturing agreement with moduslink corp under which moduslink provides substantially all outsourced manufacturing related to our retail launches of quickbooks turbotax and quicken as well as for daytoday retail order fulfillment after product launches although moduslink has operations in multiple locations that can provide redundancy if necessary we have centralized the manufacturing for our retail products in one of their facilities which is colocated with our primary retail fulfillment vendor ingram micro logistics iml a division of ingram micro inc we also outsource the product manufacturing and distribution for most of our direct sales orders to arvato services inc a division of bertelsmann ag we use john h harland company exclusively to fulfill orders for all of our printed checks and most other products for our financial supplies business 

our retail product launches are operationally complex our model for product delivery for retail launches and replenishment is a hybrid of direct to store deliveries and shipments to central warehouse locations this allows improved inventory management by our retailers we also ship products for many of our smaller retail customers through distributors we have an agreement with iml under which iml handles all logistics fulfillment and similar functions for our retail sales 

we have multiple sources for all of our raw materials and availability has historically not been a significant problem for us prior to major product releases for our core desktop software products we tend to have significant levels of backlog but at other times backlog is minimal and we typically ship products within a few days of receiving an order because of this fluctuation in backlog we believe that backlog is not a reliable predictor of our future core desktop software sales 

internetbased products and services 

intuit’s data centers house most of the systems networks and databases required to operate and deliver our internetbased products and services these include quickbooks online edition quickbooks online payroll quickbooks assisted payroll service complete webbased payroll turbotax online consumer and professional electronic tax filing services quickencom and quickbase through our data centers we connect customers to products and services and we store the vast amount of data that represents the content on our web sites as our businesses continue to move toward delivering more webbased products and services this infrastructure will become even more critical in the future our data centers consist of numerous servers and databases located in several sites across the united states in order to prevent interruptions to the availability of our internetbased products and services we have implemented practices for creating a faulttolerant environment however we do not have complete redundancy for all of our systems we have backup processing capabilities that are designed to protect us against siterelated disasters for many of our missioncritical applications despite our efforts to maintain continuous and reliable server operations we occasionally experience unplanned outages or technical difficulties 

privacy and security of customer information 

we are subject to various federal state and international laws and regulations and financial institution requirements relating to the privacy and security of customer and employee personal information we are also subject to laws and regulations that apply to telemarketing and email activities additional laws in both areas are likely to be passed in the future which could result in significant limitations on the ways in which we can communicate with our customers and significantly increase our compliance costs if our business expands to new industry segments that are regulated for privacy and security or to countries outside the united states that have strict data protections laws our compliance requirements and costs will increase 

we comply with united states federal and other country guidelines and practices to help ensure that customers are aware of and can control how we use information about them our primary web sites such as quickbookscom turbotaxcom and quickencom have been certified by truste an independent nonprofit organization that operates a web site privacy certification program representing industry standard practices to address users’ and regulators’ concerns about online privacy we also use privacy statements to provide notice to customers of our privacy practices as well as provide them the opportunity to furnish instructions with respect to use of their personal information 

to address security concerns we use security safeguards to help protect the information customers give to us from loss misuse and unauthorized alteration whenever customers transmit sensitive information such as a credit card number or tax return data to us through one of our web sites that information is stored on secure servers that allow encryption of the information as it is transmitted to us we work to protect personally identifiable information stored on the web site’s servers from unauthorized internal or external access using commercially available computer security products such as firewalls as well as internally developed security procedures and practices 

government regulation 

we offer certain products and services such as small business payroll which are subject to special regulatory requirements as we expand our small business products and services we may become subject to additional government regulation particularly in the areas of retirement planning and other employer services new laws or regulations may be adopted in these areas that could impose significant limitations on our business and increase our cost of compliance we continually analyze new business opportunities and new businesses that we pursue may require additional costs for regulatory compliance 

intellectual property 

we regard our products as proprietary we attempt to protect our product technology by relying on a combination of copyright patent trade secret and trademark laws restrictions on disclosure and other methods in particular we have a substantial number of registered trademarks including intuit quickbooks turbotax lacerte proseries and quicken we have registered these and other trademarks and service marks in the united states and depending on the relevance of each brand to other markets in many foreign countries the initial duration of trademark registrations varies from country to country and is 10 years in the united states most registrations can be renewed perpetually at 10year intervals we also currently hold a small but growing patent portfolio we regularly file applications for patents and trademarks and service marks in order to protect proprietary intellectual property that we believe is important to our business we also license some intellectual property from third parties for use in our products 

we face a number of risks relating to our intellectual property including unauthorized use and unauthorized copying or piracy of our products litigation may be necessary to protect our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others patents that have been issued to us could be determined to be invalid and may not be enforceable against competitive products in every jurisdiction furthermore other parties have asserted and may in the future assert infringement claims against us these claims and any litigation may result in invalidation of our proprietary rights or a finding of infringement against us along 

with an assessment of damages litigation even if not meritorious could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention in addition third party licenses may not continue to be available to us on commercially acceptable terms or at all 

employees 

as of august 31 2006 we had approximately 7500 employees located in the united states and internationally in canada and several other locations we believe our future success and growth will depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees in all areas of our business we do not currently have any collective bargaining agreements with our employees and we believe employee relations are generally good although we have employmentrelated agreements with a number of key employees these agreements do not guarantee continued service we believe we offer competitive compensation and a good working environment we were named one of fortune magazine’s “100 best companies to work for” in each of the last five years however we face intense competition for qualified employees and we expect to face continuing challenges in recruiting and retention 




 item 1a risk factors 

forwardlooking statements and risk factors 

this annual report on form 10k contains forwardlooking statements all statements in this report other than statements that are purely historical are forwardlooking statements words such as “expects” “anticipates” “intends” “plans” “believes” “forecasts” “estimates” “seeks” and similar expressions also identify forwardlooking statements in this report forwardlooking statements include without limitation the following 

 

we caution investors that forwardlooking statements are only predictions based on our current expectations about future events and are not guarantees of future performance we encourage you to read carefully all information provided in this report and in our other filings with the sec before deciding to invest in our stock or to maintain or change your investment these forwardlooking statements are based on information as of the filing date of this annual report and we undertake no obligation to revise or update any forwardlooking statement for any reason 

because forwardlooking statements involve risks and uncertainties there are important factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forwardlooking statements these factors include the following 

we face intense competitive pressures in all of our businesses that may negatively impact our revenue profitability and market position 

we have formidable competitors and we expect competition to remain intense during fiscal 2007 and beyond the number resources and sophistication of the companies with whom we compete have increased as we continue to expand our product and service offerings our competitors may introduce new and improved products and services bundle new offerings with marketleading products reduce prices gain better access to distribution channels advertise aggressively or beat us to market with new products and services we also face growing competition from providers of free online accounting bookkeeping tax and other businessrelated services any of these competitive actions taken over any prolonged period could diminish our revenue and profitability and could affect our ability to keep existing customers and acquire new customers some additional competitive factors that may impact our businesses are discussed below 

quickbooks and payroll and payments losing existing or potential quickbooks customers to competitors causes us to lose potential software revenue and also limits our opportunities to sell related products and services such as our financial supplies small business payroll and merchant services offerings many competitors provide accounting and business management products and services to small businesses for example microsoft corporation currently offers microsoft office small business accounting and offers in partnership with third parties several other competitive products and services including a payroll solution for small businesses credit and debit card processing services and business checks forms envelopes and related printed products we expect that competition from microsoft as well as new or currently unidentified competitors will intensify over time with these and future offerings that directly compete with quickbooks and our other offerings although we have successfully competed with microsoft in the past microsoft’s small business product and service offerings may still have a significant negative impact on our future revenue and profitability 

our principal competitors in the small business payroll services business benefit from greater economies of scale due to their substantial size which may result in pricing pressure for our offerings the growth of electronic banking and other electronic payment systems is decreasing the demand for checks and consequently causing pricing pressure for our financial supplies business as competitors aggressively compete for share of this shrinking market 

several of our products also compete with webbased electronic banking finance tracking and management tools that are becoming increasingly available at no cost to consumers if we are unable to provide products with features and services that compete effectively with these free offerings our revenue and profitability may suffer 

consumer tax  our consumer tax business faces significant competition from both the public and private sector in the public sector we face the risk of federal and state taxing authorities developing or contracting to provide software or other systems to facilitate tax return preparation and electronic filing at no charge to taxpayers 

 

 

professional tax our proseries professional tax offerings face pricing pressure from competitors seeking to obtain our customers through deep product discounts and loss of customers to competitors offering nofrills offerings at low prices such as cch’s atx product line our lacerte professional tax offerings face competition from competitivelypriced tax and accounting solutions that include integration with nontax functionality 

other businesses our quicken products compete both with microsoft money which is aggressively promoted and priced and with webbased electronic banking and personal finance tracking and management tools that are becoming increasingly available at no cost to consumers these competitive pressures may result in reduced revenue and lower profitability for our quicken product line and related bill payment service offering 

future revenue growth for our core products depends upon our successful introduction of new and enhanced products and services 

a number of our businesses derive a significant amount of their revenue through onetime upfront license fees and rely on customer upgrades and service offerings to generate a significant portion of their revenues in addition our consumer tax business depends significantly on revenue from customers who return each year to use our updated tax preparation and filing software and services as our existing products mature encouraging customers to purchase product upgrades becomes more challenging unless new product releases provide features and functionality that have meaningful incremental value if we are not able to develop and clearly demonstrate the value of upgraded products to our customers our upgrade and service revenues will be harmed similarly our business will be harmed if we are not successful in our efforts to develop and introduce new products and services to retain our existing customers expand our customer base and increase revenues per customer 

in some cases we may expend a significant amount of resources and management attention on products or services that do not ultimately succeed in their markets we have encountered difficulty in launching new products and services in the past for example at the end of fiscal 2005 we discontinued our snaptax consumer tax offering and in fiscal 2004 we discontinued our quickbooks premier healthcare offering due to lack of customer demand if we misjudge customer needs our new products and services will not succeed and our revenues and earnings will be harmed as we expand our offerings to new customer categories we run the risk of customers shifting from higher 

priced and higher margin products to newly introduced lower priced offerings for instance our quickbooks simple start offering and our proseries basic and proseries express offerings may attract users that would otherwise have purchased our higher priced more full featured offerings 

if we fail to maintain reliable and responsive service levels for our electronic tax offerings or if the irs or other governmental agencies experience difficulties in receiving customer submissions we could lose customers and our revenue and earnings could decrease 

our webbased tax preparation services and electronic filing services are an important and growing part of our tax businesses and must effectively handle extremely heavy customer demand during the peak tax season from january to april we face significant risks and challenges in maintaining these services and maintaining adequate service levels particularly during peak volume service times similarly governmental entities receiving electronic tax filings must also handle large volumes of data and may experience difficulties with their systems preventing the receipt of electronic filings if customers are unable to file their returns electronically they may elect to make paper filings this would result in reduced electronic tax return preparation and filing revenues and would harm our reputation and ability to attract and retain customers we have experienced relatively brief unscheduled interruptions in our electronic filing andor tax preparation services during past tax years for example on april 17 2006 we chose to refresh our systems during the day in preparation for anticipated heavy evening volume and this resulted in electronic filing services being unavailable to our customers for about twenty minutes any prolonged interruptions in our webbased tax preparation or electronic filing service at any time during the tax season could result in lost customers negative publicity and increased operating costs any of which could significantly harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

the nature of our products necessitates timely product launches and if we experience significant product quality problems or delays it will harm our revenue earnings and reputation 

all of our tax products and many of our nontax products have rigid development timetables that increase the risk of errors in our products and the risk of launch delays our tax preparation software product development cycle is particularly challenging due to the need to incorporate unpredictable tax law and tax form changes each year and because our customers expect high levels of accuracy and a timely launch of these products to prepare and file their taxes by april 15th due to the complexity of our products and the condensed development cycles under which we operate our products sometimes contain “bugs” that can unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the software when we encounter problems we may be required to modify our code distribute patches to customers who have already purchased the product and recall or repackage existing product inventory in our distribution channels if we encounter development challenges or discover errors in our products late in our development cycle it may cause us to delay our product launch date any major defects or launch delays could lead to loss of customers and revenue negative publicity customer and employee dissatisfaction reduced retailer shelf space and promotions and increased operating expenses such as inventory replacement costs legal fees or payments resulting from our commitment to reimburse penalties and interest paid by customers due solely to calculation errors in our consumer tax preparation products 

possession and use of personal customer information by our businesses presents risks and expenses that could harm our business 

a number of our businesses collect use and retain large amounts of personal customer information including credit card numbers tax return information bank account numbers and passwords personal and business financial data social security numbers and other payroll information we also collect and maintain personal information of our employees in the ordinary course of our business some of this personal customer and employee information is held and managed by third parties we and our vendors use commercially available encryption technology to transmit personal information when taking orders we use security and business controls to limit access and use of personal information however a third party may be able to circumvent these security and business measures and errors in the storage use or transmission of personal information could result in a breach of customer or employee privacy we employ contractors temporary and seasonal employees who may have access to the personal information of customers and employees while we conduct necessary and appropriate background checks of these individuals and limit access to personal information it is possible one of these individuals could circumvent these controls which would result in a breach of customer or employee privacy possession and use of personal information in conducting our business subjects us to legislative and regulatory burdens that could require notification of data 

breach restrict our use of personal information and hinder our ability to acquire new customers or market to existing customers we have incurred – and will continue to incur – significant expenses to comply with mandatory privacy and security standards and protocols imposed by law regulation industry standards or contractual obligations 

in the past we have experienced lawsuits and negative publicity relating to privacy issues and we could face similar suits in the future a major breach of customer privacy or security by us or the third parties that hold and manage personal information could have serious negative consequences for our businesses including possible fines penalties and damages reduced customer demand for our services harm to our reputation and brands further regulation and oversight by federal or state agencies and loss of our ability to accept and process customer credit card orders or tax returns although we have sophisticated network and application security internal control measures and physical security procedures to safeguard customer and employee information there can be no assurance that a personal information breach loss or theft will not occur which could harm our business customer reputation and results of operations if our business expands to new industry segments that are regulated for privacy and security or to countries outside the united states that have more strict data protection laws our compliance requirements and costs will increase 

our revenue and earnings are highly seasonal and our quarterly results fluctuate significantly 

several of our businesses are highly seasonal causing significant quarterly fluctuations in our financial results revenue and operating results are usually strongest during the second and third fiscal quarters ending january 31 and april 30 due to our tax businesses contributing most of their revenue during those quarters and the timing of the release of our small business software products and upgrades we experience lower revenues and significant operating losses in the first and fourth quarters ending october 31 and july 31 for example in the second and third quarters of fiscal 2005 and 2006 we had total net revenue of between 6482 million and 9526 million while in the first and fourth quarters of fiscal 2005 and 2006 we had total net revenue of between 2528 million and 3429 million our financial results can also fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year due to a variety of factors including changes in product sales mix that affect average selling prices product release dates the timing of our discontinuance of support for older product offerings our methods for distributing our products including the shift to a consignment model for some of our desktop products sold through retail distribution channels the inclusion of upgrades with certain offerings and the timing of our delivery of state tax forms both of which can impact the pattern of revenue recognition and the timing of acquisitions divestitures and goodwill and purchased intangible asset impairment charges 

the growth of our business depends on our ability to adapt to rapid technological change 

the software industry in which we operate is characterized by rapidly changing technology evolving industry standards and frequent new product introductions and enhancements our right for me marketing approach increases the importance for us of developing additional versions of our products to meet specific customer needs our ability to succeed in this rapidly changing environment requires that we continuously invest resources to enhance our software architecture and developer tools we must make this investment in order to continue to enhance our current products and develop new products to meet changing customer needs and to attract and retain talented software developers we are currently in the process of modernizing the software platforms for a number of our product lines including our quickbooks turbotax and quicken products completing these upgrades and adapting to other technological developments may require considerable time and expense if we experience prolonged delays or unforeseen difficulties in upgrading our software architecture our ability to develop new products and enhancements to our current products would suffer 

failure to maintain the availability and security of the systems networks databases and software required to operate and deliver our internetbased products and services could adversely affect our operating results 

our ecommerce web sites and our internetbased product and service offerings including quickbooks online edition quickbooks online payroll quickbooks assisted payroll service complete webbased payroll turbo tax online consumer and professional electronic tax filing services quickencom and quickbase rely on a variety of systems networks and databases many of which are maintained by us at our data centers in order to prevent interruptions to the availability of our ecommerce web sites and internetbased products and services we have implemented practices for creating a faulttolerant environment however we do not have complete redundancy for all of our systems we may also need to grow reconfigure or relocate our data centers in response to changing 

business needs which may be costly and lead to unplanned disruptions of service we do not maintain realtime backup of our data and in the event of significant system disruption particularly during peak tax filing season we could experience loss of data or tax return processing capabilities which could cause us to lose customers and could materially harm our operating results we maintain backup processing capabilities that are designed to protect us against siterelated disasters for many of our missioncritical applications notwithstanding our efforts to protect against “down time” for our ecommerce web sites and internetbased products and services we do occasionally experience unplanned outages or technical difficulties in order to provide our internetbased products and services we must protect the security of our systems networks databases and software 

like all companies that deliver products and services via the internet we are subject to attack by computer hackers who develop and deploy software that is designed to penetrate the security of our systems and networks if hackers were able to penetrate our security systems they could misappropriate or damage our proprietary information or cause disruptions in the delivery of our products and services we believe that we have taken steps to protect against such attacks however there can be no assurance that our security measures will not be penetrated by hackers in the event that the systems networks databases and software required to deliver our internetbased products and services become unavailable or suffer technical difficulties or a breach in security we may be required to expend significant resources to alleviate these problems and our operating results could suffer in addition any such interruption or breach of security could damage our reputation and lead to the loss of customers 

our reliance on a limited number of manufacturing and distribution suppliers could harm our business 

we have chosen to outsource the manufacturing and distribution of many of our desktop software products to a small number of third party providers and we use a single vendor to produce and distribute our check and business forms supplies products although our reliance on a small number of suppliers or a single supplier provides us with efficiencies and enhanced bargaining power poor performance by or lack of effective communication with these parties can significantly harm our business this risk is amplified by the fact that we carry very little inventory and rely on justintime manufacturing processes in particular the loss of our principal manufacturing partner for retail would be disruptive to our business and could cause delay in a product launch we seek to mitigate this risk by managing our second tier vendors and maintaining contingency plans during fiscal 2004 one of our suppliers was unable to fulfill orders for some of our software products for a number of days due to operational difficulties and communication errors although together we were able to mitigate the impact of that delay with minimal disruption to our business if we experience longer delays delays during a peak demand period or significant quality issues our business could be significantly harmed 

overall capacity for the manufacture of optical media compact discs in the us has decreased due to a market shift to the dvd format this decrease in cd production capacity could require us to identify review and engage new manufacturing sources within or outside the us or change to dvd format which would be more expensive than cd media this could affect our ability to timely manufacture and deliver our products at retail which could harm our financial condition and results of operations 

as our product and service offerings become more complex our revenue streams may become less predictable  

our expanding range of products and services generates more varied revenue streams than our traditional desktop software businesses the accounting policies that apply to these revenue streams are more complex than those that apply to our traditional products and services we expect this trend to continue as we expand our offerings for example as we begin to offer additional features and options as part of multipleelement revenue arrangements we could be required to defer a higher percentage of our product revenue at the time of sale than we do for traditional products this would decrease recognized revenue at the time products are shipped but result in increased recognized revenue in fiscal periods after shipment 

we face a number of risks in our merchant card processing business that could result in a reduction in our revenue and earnings 

our merchant card processing service business is subject to several risks including the following 

 

 

should any of these risks be realized our business could be harmed and our financial results could suffer 

our dependence on a small number of larger retailers and distributors could harm our results of operations 

we sell most of our desktop software products through our retail distribution channel and a relatively small number of larger retailers and distributors generate a significant portion of our sales volume our principal retailers have significant bargaining leverage due to their size and available resources any change in principal business terms termination or major disruption of our relationship with these resellers could result in a potentially significant decline in our revenues and earnings for example the sourcing decisions product display locations and promotional activities that retailers undertake can greatly impact the sales of our products the fact that we also sell our products directly could cause retailers or distributors to reduce their efforts to promote our products or stop selling our products altogether if any of our retailers or distributors run into financial difficulties we may be unable to collect amounts that we are owed at january 31 2006 in the midst of the 2005 consumer tax season amounts due from our 10 largest retailers and distributors represented approximately 51 of total gross accounts receivable 

failure of our information technology systems or those of our service providers could adversely affect our future operating results 

we rely on a variety of internal technology systems and technology systems maintained by our outside manufacturing and distribution suppliers to take and fulfill customer orders handle customer service requests host our webbased activities support internal operations and store customer and company data these systems could be damaged or interrupted preventing us or our service providers from accepting and fulfilling customer orders or otherwise interrupting our business in addition these systems could suffer security breaches causing company and customer data to be unintentionally disclosed any of these occurrences could adversely impact our operations we have experienced system slowdowns and interruptions in the past that have caused loss of productivity and added expense we also experience computer server failures from time to time to prevent interruptions we must continue to upgrade our information systems to further improve performance and help ensure that we have adequate recoverability the expansion and upgrade of our systems could be costly and problems with the design or implementation of system enhancements could harm our ability to take customer orders ship products support and invoice our customers and otherwise run our business while we and our outside service partners have backup systems for certain aspects of our operations not all of these systems are fully redundant and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities 

increased government regulation of tax preparation services could harm our business 

the tax preparation industry has received increased attention from legislative and regulatory bodies in recent years both because of the continuing focus on free tax preparation and because of the nature of certain services used to process and transfer refunds to taxpayers if legislative or regulatory bodies increase their regulation or oversight of the tax preparation industry this could increase our cost of doing business by imposing new regulations and could limit our revenue opportunities by restricting the types of products and services we can offer 

we are required to comply with a variety of state revenue agency standards in order to successfully operate our tax preparation and electronic filing services changes in stateimposed requirements by one or more of the states including the required use of specific technologies or technology standards could significantly increase the costs of providing those services to our customers and could prevent us from delivering a quality product to our customers in a timely manner 

if we do not respond promptly and effectively to customer service and technical support inquiries we will lose customers and our revenue and earnings will decline 

the effectiveness of our customer service and technical support operations are critical to customer satisfaction and our financial success if we do not respond effectively to service and technical support requests we will lose customers and miss revenue opportunities such as paid service product renewals and new product sales we occasionally experience customer service and technical support problems including longer than expected waiting times for customers when our staffing and systems are inadequate to handle a higherthananticipated volume of requests training and retaining qualified customer service and technical support personnel is particularly challenging due to the expansion of our product offerings and the seasonality of our tax business for example in fiscal 2006 the number of our consumer tax service representatives ranged from about 50 during offseason months to about 1050 at the peak of the tax season if we do not adequately train our support representatives our customers will not receive an appropriate level of support we will lose customers and our financial results will suffer 

if we encounter problems with our thirdparty customer service and technical support providers our business will be harmed and our margins will decline 

we outsource a substantial portion of our customer service and technical support activities to domestic and international thirdparty service providers including service providers in india and the philippines we rely heavily on thirdparty customer service representatives working on our behalf and we expect to continue to rely heavily on third parties in the future this strategy provides us with lower operating costs and greater flexibility but also presents risks to our business including the following 

 

we are exposed to risks associated with credit card and payment fraud and with credit card processing 

many of our customers use credit cards or automated payment systems to pay for our products and services we have suffered losses and may continue to suffer losses as a result of orders placed with fraudulent credit card or other payment data for example under current credit card practices we may be liable for fraudulent credit card transactions if we do not obtain a cardholder’s signature a frequent practice in internet sales we employ technology solutions to help us detect fraudulent transactions however the failure to detect or control payment fraud could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

we are subject to payment card association operating rules and certification requirements as in effect from time to time failure to comply with these rules or requirements may subject us to fines and higher transaction fees or cause us to lose our ability to accept credit card payments from our customers resulting in harm to our business and results of operations 

if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights competitors may exploit our innovations which could weaken our competitive position and reduce our revenue and earnings 

our success depends upon our proprietary technology we rely on a combination of copyright trade secret trademark patent confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights as part of our confidentiality procedures we generally enter into nondisclosure agreements with our employees contractors distributors and corporate partners and into license agreements with respect to our software documentation and other proprietary information the creation and protection of our proprietary rights are expensive and may require us to engage in costly and distracting litigation despite these precautions third parties could copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology without authorization because we outsource significant aspects of our product development manufacturing and distribution we are at risk that confidential portions of our intellectual property could become public by lapses in security by our contractors we have licensed in the past and expect to license in the future certain of our proprietary rights such as trademarks or copyrighted material to others these licensees may take actions that diminish the value of our proprietary rights or harm our reputation it is also possible that other companies could successfully challenge the validity or scope of our patents and that our patent portfolio which is relatively small may not provide us with adequate protection ultimately our attempts to secure legal protection for our proprietary rights may not be adequate and our competitors could independently develop similar technologies duplicate our products or design around patents and other intellectual property rights if our intellectual property protection proves inadequate we could lose our competitive advantage and our financial results will suffer 

third parties claiming that we infringe their proprietary rights could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and prevent us from selling our products 

from time to time we have received claims that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of others as the number of products in the software industry increases and the functionality of these products further overlap and as we acquire technology through acquisitions or licenses we believe that we may become increasingly subject to infringement claims including patent copyright and trademark infringement claims we expect that software products in general will increasingly be subject to these claims as the number of products and competitors increase the functionality of products overlap and as the patenting of software functionality continues to grow we have from time to time received allegations of patent infringement claims in the past and may receive more claims in the future based on allegations that our products infringe upon patents held by third parties future claims could present an exposure of uncertain magnitude we believe that we would be able to obtain any necessary licenses or other rights to disputed intellectual property rights on commercially reasonable terms however the ultimate outcome of any allegation is uncertain and regardless of outcome any such claim with or without merit could be time consuming to defend result in costly litigation divert management’s time and attention from our business require us to stop selling to delay shipping or to redesign our products or require us to pay monetary damages for royalty or licensing arrangements or to satisfy indemnification obligations that we have with some of our customers our failure to obtain necessary license or other rights or litigation arising out of intellectual property claims could adversely affect our business 

in addition we license and use software from third parties in our business these third party software licenses may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms also these third parties may from time to time receive claims that they have infringed the intellectual property rights of others including patent and copyright infringement claims which may affect our ability to continue licensing their software our inability to use any of this third party software could result in shipment delays or other disruptions in our business which could materially and adversely affect our operating results 

we expect copying and misuse of our intellectual property to be a persistent problem causing lost revenue and increased expenses 

our intellectual property rights are among our most valuable assets policing unauthorized use and copying of our products is difficult expensive and time consuming current us laws that prohibit copying give us only limited practical protection from software piracy and the laws of many other countries provide very little protection we may not be able to prevent misappropriation of our technology for example we frequently encounter unauthorized copies of our software being sold through online auction sites and other online marketplaces in addition efforts to 

protect our intellectual property may be misunderstood and perceived negatively by our customers although we continue to evaluate and put in place technology solutions to attempt to lessen the impact of piracy and we continue to increase our civil and criminal enforcement efforts we expect piracy to be a persistent problem that results in lost revenues and increased expenses 

although we are unable to quantify the extent of piracy of our software products software piracy may depress our net revenues we engage in efforts to educate consumers on the benefits of licensing genuine products and to educate lawmakers on the advantages of a business climate where intellectual property rights are protected and we cooperate with the software  information industry association in their efforts to combat piracy however these efforts may not fully combat the effect of piracy of our products 

we do not own all of the software other technologies and content used in our products and services 

many of our products are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties we believe we have all of the necessary licenses from third parties to use and distribute third party technology and content that we do not own that is used in our current products and services from time to time we may be required to renegotiate with these third parties – or negotiate with new third parties – to include their technology or content in our existing products in new versions of our existing products or in wholly new products we may not be able to negotiate or renegotiate licenses on reasonable terms or at all if we are unable to obtain the rights necessary to use or continue to use thirdparty technology or content in our products and services we may not be able to sell the affected products which would in turn have a negative impact on our revenue and operating results 

our acquisition activity could disrupt our ongoing business and may present risks not contemplated at the time of the transactions 

we have acquired and may continue to acquire companies products and technologies that complement our strategic direction these acquisitions may involve significant risks and uncertainties including 

 

acquisitions are inherently risky we can not be certain that our previous or future acquisitions will be successful and will not materially adversely affect the conduct operating results or financial condition of our business we have generally paid cash for our recent acquisitions future transactions may involve further use of our cash resources the issuance of equity or debt securities the incurrence of other forms of debt or the amortization of expenses related to intangible assets any of which could harm our financial condition and results of operations if we issue equity securities as consideration in an acquisition current shareholders’ percentage ownership and earnings per share may be diluted 

if actual product returns exceed returns reserves our financial results would be harmed 

we ship more desktop software products to our distributors and retailers than we expect them to sell in order to reduce the risk that distributors or retailers will run out of products this is particularly true for our consumer tax products which have a short selling season and for which returns occur primarily in our fiscal third and fourth quarters like many software companies that sell their products through distributors and retailers we have historically accepted significant product returns we establish reserves against revenue for product returns in our financial statements based on estimated returns and we closely monitor product sales and inventory in the retail channel in an effort to maintain adequate reserves in the past returns have not differed significantly from these reserves however if we experience actual returns that significantly exceed reserves it would result in lower net revenue for example if we had increased our fiscal 2006 returns reserves by 1 of nonconsignment sales to retailers for quickbooks turbotax and quicken our fiscal 2006 total net revenue would have been approximately 35 million lower in addition our policy of recognizing revenue from distributors and retailers upon delivery of 

product for nonconsignment sales is predicated upon our ability to reasonably estimate returns if we do not continue to demonstrate our ability to estimate returns then our revenue recognition policy for these types of sales may no longer be appropriate 

acquisitionrelated costs and impairment charges can cause significant fluctuation in our net income 

our acquisitions have resulted in significant expenses including amortization of purchased intangible assets which is reflected in cost of revenue charges for inprocess research and development impairment of goodwill amortization and impairment of purchased intangible assets and charges for deferred compensation which are reflected in operating expenses total acquisitionrelated costs in the categories identified above were 232 million in fiscal 2006 268 million in fiscal 2005 and 336 million in fiscal 2004 although under current accounting rules goodwill is no longer amortized we may incur impairment charges related to the goodwill already recorded and to goodwill arising out of future acquisitions we test the impairment of goodwill annually in our fourth fiscal quarter or more frequently if indicators of impairment arise the timing of the formal annual test may result in charges to our statement of operations in our fourth fiscal quarter that could not have been reasonably foreseen in prior periods for example at the end of fiscal 2004 we incurred a goodwill impairment charge of 187 million related to our intuit public sector solutions business which was subsequently sold at july 31 2006 we had goodwill of 5050 million and unamortized purchased intangible assets of 595 million on our balance sheet both of which could be subject to impairment charges in the future new acquisitions and any impairment of the value of purchased assets could have a significant negative impact on our future operating results 

if we fail to operate our payroll business effectively our revenue and earnings will be harmed 

our payroll business handles a significant amount of dollar and transaction volume due to the size and volume of transactions that we handle effective processing systems and controls are essential to ensure that transactions are handled appropriately despite our efforts it is possible that we may make errors or that funds may be misappropriated in addition to any direct damages and fines that any such problems would create which could be substantial the loss of customer confidence in our accuracy and controls would seriously harm our business our payroll business has grown largely through acquisitions and our systems are comprised of multiple technology platforms that are difficult to scale we must constantly continue to upgrade our systems and processes to ensure that we process customer data in an accurate reliable and timely manner these upgrades must also meet the various regulatory requirements and deadlines associated with employerrelated payroll activities any failure of our systems or processes in critical switchover times such as in january when many businesses elect to change payroll service providers would be detrimental to our business if we failed to timely deliver any of our payroll products it could cause our current and prospective customers to choose a competitor’s product for that year’s payroll and not to purchase intuit products in the future if these efforts are not successful our revenue growth and profitability will decline 

interest income attributable to payroll customer deposits may fluctuate or be eliminated causing our revenue and earnings to decline 

we currently record revenue from interest earned on customer deposits that we hold pending payment of funds to taxing authorities or to customers’ employees if interest rates decline or there are regulatory changes that diminish the amount of time that we are required or permitted to hold such funds our interest revenue will decline 

we may be unable to attract and retain key personnel 

much of our future success depends on the continued service and availability of skilled personnel including members of our executive team and those in technical marketing and staff positions experienced personnel in the software and services industries are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense especially in silicon valley and san diego california where the majority of our employees are located although we strive to be an employer of choice we may not be able to continue to successfully attract and retain key personnel which would cause our business to suffer 

we are frequently a party to litigation that is costly to defend and consumes the time of our management 

due to our financial position and the large number of customers that we serve we are often forced to defend litigation see item 3 “legal proceedings” for information regarding specific pending litigation defending litigation consumes the time of our management and is expensive for intuit even though we often seek insurance coverage for litigation defense costs there is no assurance that our defense costs which can be substantial will be covered in all cases in addition by its nature litigation is unpredictable and we may not prevail even in cases where we strongly believe a plaintiff’s case has no valid claims if we do not prevail in litigation we may be required to pay substantial monetary damages or alter our business operations regardless of the outcome litigation is expensive and consumes the time of our management and may ultimately reduce our income 

unanticipated changes in our tax rates could affect our future financial results 

our future effective tax rates could be favorably or unfavorably affected by unanticipated changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or by changes in tax laws or their interpretation in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls we may not be able to detect fraud or report our financial results accurately which could harm our business and the trading price of our common stock 

we periodically assess our system of internal controls and the internal controls of service providers upon which we rely to review their effectiveness and identify potential areas of improvement in addition from time to time we acquire businesses many of which have limited infrastructure and systems of internal controls performing assessments of internal controls implementing necessary changes and maintaining an effective controls environment is expensive and requires considerable management attention internal control systems are designed in part upon assumptions about the likelihood of future events and all such systems however well designed and operated can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance that the objectives of the system are met because of the inherent limitations of control systems there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions if we fail to implement and maintain an effective system of internal controls or prevent fraud we could suffer losses could be subject to costly litigation investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information and our brand and operating results could be harmed 

we and our independent registered public accounting firm must certify the adequacy of our internal controls over financial reporting annually identification of material weaknesses in internal controls over financial reporting could harm our competitive position in our business especially our payroll business 

business interruptions could adversely affect our future operating results 

several of our major business operations are subject to interruption by earthquake fire power shortages terrorist attacks and other hostile acts and other events beyond our control the majority of our research and development activities our corporate headquarters our principal information technology systems and other critical business operations are located near major seismic faults we do not carry earthquake insurance for direct quakerelated losses while we maintain disaster recovery facilities for key data centers that support the information systems networks and databases that are necessary to operate our business we are still in the process of establishing disaster recovery facilities for some of our data centers our operating results and financial condition could be materially harmed in the event of a major earthquake or other natural or manmade disaster

the leases for our existing san diego california office space expire in 2007 in fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2006 we entered into agreements under which we will lease approximately 466000 square feet of office space in four buildings to be constructed by the landlord in san diego the lease term will begin upon the date we first occupy the buildings which we expect to occur in the summer of 2007 the lease term will end on the later of august 31 2017 or ten years after the date we first occupy the buildings 

we also lease or own facilities in a number of other domestic locations and internationally in the united kingdom and several other locations we believe our facilities are adequate for our current and nearterm needs and that we will be able to locate additional facilities as needed see note 10 to the financial statements for more information about our lease commitments 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

stock optionrelated matters 

in light of media reports alleging improper stock option granting practices by public companies including a report from the center for financial research and analysis in may 2006 we began a voluntary review of our historical stock option grant activities and related accounting treatment our board of directors formed a special committee of independent directors to conduct this review with the assistance of independent legal counsel and independent forensic accounting support the primary scope of this review covered the period from august 1 1997 to the present subsequent to our initiation of this review we received an informal inquiry from the securities and exchange commission and a subpoena from the united states attorney for the northern district of california requesting documents relating to our historical stock option granting practices we have fully cooperated with both of these inquiries and will continue to do so on august 16 2006 we announced the completion of our independent review which uncovered no evidence of fraud or intentional wrongdoing in our historical stock option granting practices we have reported this conclusion to the sec and the united states attorney 

muriel siebert  co inc v intuit inc index no 03602942 supreme court of the state of new york county of new york 

on september 17 2003 muriel siebert  co inc filed a complaint against intuit alleging various claims for breach of contract breach of express and implied covenants of good faith and fair dealing breach of fiduciary duty misrepresentation andor fraud and promissory estoppel the allegations relate to quicken brokerage powered by siebert a strategic alliance between the two companies the complaint seeks compensatory damages of up to 111 million punitive damages of up to 330 million and other damages intuit unsuccessfully sought to compel the matter to arbitration on february 7 2005 intuit filed a motion to dismiss all but one of the plaintiff’s claims in new york state court on september 6 2005 the court dismissed siebert’s fraud and punitive damages claims the case is now stayed pending appellate review by the appellate division of the new york supreme court of certain procedural issues in the case intuit believes this lawsuit is without merit and will vigorously defend the litigation 

other litigation matters 

intuit is subject to certain routine legal proceedings as well as demands claims and threatened litigation that arise in the normal course of our business including assertions that we may be infringing patents or other intellectual property rights of others we currently believe that the ultimate amount of liability if any for any pending claims of any type either alone or combined will not materially affect our financial position results of operations or cash flows we also believe that we would be able to obtain any necessary licenses or other rights to disputed intellectual property rights on commercially reasonable terms however the ultimate outcome of any litigation is uncertain and regardless of outcome litigation can have an adverse impact on intuit because of defense costs negative publicity diversion of management resources and other factors our failure to obtain necessary license or other rights or litigation arising out of intellectual property claims could adversely affect our business

executive overview 

this overview provides a high level discussion of our operating results and some of the trends that affect our business we believe that an understanding of these trends is important in order to understand our financial results for fiscal 2006 as well as our future prospects this summary is not intended to be exhaustive nor is it intended to be a substitute for the detailed discussion and analysis provided elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

about intuit 

intuit is a leading provider of business and financial management solutions for small businesses consumers and accountants we organize our business into the following five segments 

 

 

 

overview of financial results 

total net revenue for fiscal 2006 was 23 billion up 15 compared with fiscal 2005 three quarters of the fiscal 2006 revenue increase was due to growth in our consumer tax and payroll and payments segments consumer tax revenue was 25 higher in fiscal 2006 driven by a 57 increase in federal turbotax online units sold and to a lesser extent by growth in revenue from attach services such as electronic filing we believe that the continuing trend among individual taxpayers toward the use of both online and desktop software rather than manual methods to prepare their own income tax returns will continue to be important to the growth of our consumer tax business payroll and payments revenue was 24 higher in fiscal 2006 with combined payroll offerings accounting for slightly more than half of the increase and merchant services representing slightly less than half of the increase see “total net revenue” below for additional information 

we recorded operating income from continuing operations of 5595 million for fiscal 2006 compared with 5241 million for fiscal 2005 operating income from continuing operations for fiscal 2006 was reduced by 660 million in pretax sharebased compensation expense for stock options and our employee stock purchase plan that we recorded as a result of our adoption of sfas 123r on august 1 2005 the revenue growth that we experienced in fiscal 2006 was partially offset by these sharebased compensation expenses and by higher spending for new product development marketing and customer support 

our net income from continuing operations of 3774 million for fiscal 2006 was flat compared with 3750 million for fiscal 2005 our net income from continuing operations for fiscal 2005 would have been approximately 80 million lower if it had included pro forma sharebased compensation expense and excluded certain discrete tax benefits diluted net income per share from continuing operations of 105 for fiscal 2006 increased 6 compared with 099 for fiscal 2005 due to the net reduction in average shares outstanding average shares outstanding declined as a result of repurchases of common stock under our stock repurchase programs partially offset by the issuance of shares in connection with the exercise of stock options and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan 

in december 2005 we sold our intuit information technology solutions its business for approximately 200 million in cash the decision to sell its was a result of our desire to focus resources on our core products and services we recorded total net income from its discontinued operations of 395 million or 011 per diluted share for fiscal 2006 including 343 million or 010 per share for the net gain on disposal of that business 

in may 2006 we sold our master builder construction management software and solutions business which was part of intuit construction business solutions in our other businesses segment the master builder business had quarterly revenue of approximately 5 million we recorded a 77 million net loss on disposal of the business including income tax expense of 101 million in accordance with the provisions of sfas 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” we have not accounted for this transaction as a discontinued operation 

we ended fiscal 2006 with cash and investments totaling 12 billion in fiscal 2006 we generated cash from continuing operations from the sale of our its business and from the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans in this period we used 7842 million in cash for repurchases of common stock under our stock repurchase programs at july 31 2006 authorized funds of 5066 million remained available for stock repurchases 

seasonality 

our quickbooks consumer tax and professional tax businesses are highly seasonal some of our other offerings are also seasonal but to a lesser extent revenue from many of our small business software products including quickbooks tends to be concentrated around calendar year end sales of income tax preparation products and services are heavily concentrated in the period from november through april as a result our total net revenue is 

usually highest during our second quarter ending january 31 and third quarter ending april 30 we typically report losses in our first quarter ending october 31 and fourth quarter ending july 31 when revenue from our tax businesses is minimal while operating expenses continue at relatively consistent levels 

critical accounting policies 

in preparing our financial statements we make estimates assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on our net revenue operating income or loss and net income or loss as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our balance sheet we believe that the estimates assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies senior management has reviewed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and their disclosure in this annual report on form 10k with the audit committee of our board of directors 

net revenue — revenue recognition 

we derive revenue from the sale of packaged software products license fees software subscriptions product support professional services payroll services merchant services transaction fees and multiple element arrangements that may include any combination of these items we follow the appropriate revenue recognition rules for each type of revenue for additional information see “net revenue” in note 1 to the financial statements we generally recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists we have delivered the product or performed the service the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable however determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report for example for multiple element arrangements we must make assumptions and judgments in order to allocate the total price among the various elements we must deliver to determine whether undelivered services are essential to the functionality of the delivered products and services to determine whether vendorspecific evidence of fair value exists for each undelivered element and to determine whether and when each element has been delivered if we were to change any of these assumptions or judgments it could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period amounts for fees collected or invoiced and due relating to arrangements where revenue cannot be recognized are reflected on our balance sheet as deferred revenue and recognized when the applicable revenue recognition criteria are satisfied 

in connection with the sale of certain products we provide a limited amount of free technical support assistance to customers we do not defer the recognition of any revenue associated with sales of these products since the cost of providing this free technical support is insignificant the technical support is generally provided within one year after the associated revenue is recognized and free product enhancements are minimal and infrequent 

net revenue — return and rebate reserves 

as part of our revenue recognition policy we estimate future product returns and rebate payments and establish reserves against revenue at the time of sale based on these estimates our return policy allows distributors and retailers subject to contractual limitations to return purchased products product returns by distributors and retailers relate primarily to the return of excess and obsolete products in determining our product returns reserves we consider the volume and price mix of products in the retail channel historical return rates for prior releases of the product trends in retailer inventory and economic trends that might impact customer demand for our products including the competitive environment and the timing of new releases of our products we fully reserve for excess and obsolete products in the distribution channels 

our rebate reserves include distributor and retailer sales incentive rebates and enduser rebates our estimated reserves for distributor and retailer incentive rebates are based on distributors’ and retailers’ actual performance against the terms and conditions of rebate programs which we typically establish annually our reserves for enduser rebates are estimated based on the terms and conditions of the specific promotional rebate program actual sales during the promotion and historical redemption trends by product and by type of promotional program 

in the past actual returns and rebates have not differed significantly from the reserves that we have established however actual returns and rebates in any future period are inherently uncertain if we were to change our assumptions and estimates our revenue reserves would change which would impact the net revenue we report if 

actual returns and rebates are significantly greater than the reserves we have established the actual results would decrease our future reported revenue conversely if actual returns and rebates are significantly less than our reserves this would increase our future reported revenue for example if we had increased our fiscal 2006 returns reserves by 1 of nonconsignment sales to retailers for quickbooks turbotax and quicken our fiscal 2006 total net revenue would have been 35 million lower 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

we make ongoing assumptions relating to the collectibility of our accounts receivable the accounts receivable amount on our balance sheet includes a reserve for accounts that might not be paid in determining the amount of the reserve we consider our historical level of credit losses we also make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations and we assess current economic trends that might impact the level of credit losses in the future our reserves have generally been adequate to cover our actual credit losses however since we cannot reliably predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers we cannot guarantee that our reserves will continue to be adequate if actual credit losses are significantly greater than the reserve we have established that would increase our general and administrative expenses and reduce our reported net income conversely if actual credit losses are significantly less than our reserve this would eventually decrease our general and administrative expenses and increase our reported net income 

goodwill purchased intangible assets and other longlived assets – impairment assessments 

we make judgments about the recoverability of purchased intangible assets and other longlived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an otherthantemporary impairment in the remaining value of the assets recorded on our balance sheet may exist we test the impairment of goodwill annually in our fourth fiscal quarter or more frequently if indicators of impairment arise the timing of the formal annual test may result in charges to our statement of operations in our fourth fiscal quarter that could not have been reasonably foreseen in prior periods in order to estimate the fair value of longlived assets we typically make various assumptions about the future prospects for the business that the asset relates to consider market factors specific to that business and estimate future cash flows to be generated by that business we evaluate cash flows at the lowest operating level and the number of reporting units that we have identified may make impairment more probable than it would be at a company with fewer reporting units and integrated operations following acquisitions based on these assumptions and estimates we determine whether we need to record an impairment charge to reduce the value of the asset stated on our balance sheet to reflect its estimated fair value assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives are complex and often subjective they can be affected by a variety of factors including external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate different assumptions and estimates could materially impact our reported financial results more conservative assumptions of the anticipated future benefits from these businesses could result in impairment charges which would decrease net income and result in lower asset values on our balance sheet conversely less conservative assumptions could result in smaller or no impairment charges higher net income and higher asset values in fiscal 2004 we recorded an impairment charge of 187 million on goodwill associated with our intuit public sector solutions business which was subsequently sold at july 31 2006 we had 5050 million in goodwill and 595 million in net purchased intangible assets on our balance sheet 

accounting for sharebased compensation plans 

prior to august 1 2005 we accounted for our sharebased employee compensation plans under the measurement and recognition provisions of accounting principles board apb opinion no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” and related interpretations as permitted by financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” we recorded no sharebased employee compensation expense for options granted under our 2005 equity incentive plan or its predecessor plans prior to august 1 2005 as all options granted under those plans had exercise prices equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant we also recorded no compensation expense in connection with our employee stock purchase plan as the purchase price of the stock was not less than 85 of the lower of the fair market value of our common stock at the beginning of each offering period or at the end of each purchase period in accordance with sfas 123 and sfas 148 “accounting for stockbased compensation – 

transition and disclosure” we disclosed our net income or loss and net income or loss per share as if we had applied the fair valuebased method in measuring compensation expense for our sharebased incentive programs 

effective august 1 2005 we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas 123r “sharebased payment” using the modified prospective transition method under that transition method compensation expense that we recognize beginning on that date includes a period compensation expense for all sharebased payments granted prior to but not yet vested as of august 1 2005 based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas 123 adjusted for estimated forfeitures and b period compensation expense for all sharebased payments granted on or after august 1 2005 based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas 123r because we elected to use the modified prospective transition method results for prior periods have not been restated at july 31 2006 there was 1036 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested sharebased compensation arrangements granted under all equity compensation plans which we will amortize to expense in the future total unrecognized compensation cost will be adjusted for future changes in estimated forfeitures we expect to recognize that cost over a weighted average vesting period of 22 years 

we estimate the fair value of options granted using the blackscholes option valuation model and the assumptions shown in note 12 to the financial statements beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 we estimated the expected term of options granted based on implied exercise patterns using a binomial model prior to that we estimated the expected term of options granted based on historical exercise patterns we estimate the volatility of our common stock at the date of grant based on the implied volatility of publicly traded oneyear and twoyear options on our common stock consistent with sfas 123r and securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 107 our decision to use implied volatility was based upon the availability of actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility we base the riskfree interest rate that we use in the blackscholes option valuation model on the implied yield in effect at the time of option grant on us treasury zerocoupon issues with equivalent remaining terms we have never paid any cash dividends on our common stock and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future consequently we use an expected dividend yield of zero in the blackscholes option valuation model sfas 123r requires us to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates we use historical data to estimate prevesting option forfeitures and record sharebased compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest for options granted before august 1 2005 we amortize the fair value on an accelerated basis this is the same basis on which we amortized options granted before august 1 2005 for our pro forma disclosures under sfas 123 for options granted on or after august 1 2005 we amortize the fair value on a straightline basis all options are amortized over the requisite service periods of the awards which are generally the vesting periods we may elect to use different assumptions under the blackscholes option valuation model in the future which could materially affect our net income or loss and net income or loss per share 

in may 2006 we began a voluntary review of our historical stock option granting activities and related accounting treatment our board of directors formed a special committee of independent directors to conduct this review with the assistance of independent legal counsel and independent forensic accounting support the primary scope of this review covered the period from august 1 1997 to the present on august 16 2006 we announced the completion of our independent review which uncovered no evidence of fraud or intentional wrongdoing in our historical stock option granting practices see item 3 “legal proceedings” and note 15 to the financial statements 

legal contingencies 

we are subject to certain legal proceedings as well as demands claims and threatened litigation that arise in the normal course of our business we review the status of each significant matter quarterly and assess our potential financial exposure if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated we record a liability and an expense for the estimated loss significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination of whether an exposure is reasonably estimable our accruals are based on the best information available at the time as additional information becomes available we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates potential legal liabilities and the revision of estimates of potential legal liabilities could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 

income taxes – estimates of effective tax rates deferred taxes and valuation allowance 

when we prepare our financial statements we estimate our income taxes based on the various jurisdictions where we conduct business significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision we recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the united states and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes will be due we record an additional amount in our provision for income taxes in the period in which we determine that our recorded tax liability is less than we expect the ultimate tax assessment to be if in a later period we determine that payment of this additional amount is unnecessary we reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit in that later period as a result our ongoing assessments of the probable outcomes of the audit issues and related tax positions require judgment and can materially increase or decrease our effective tax rate and materially affect our operating results this also requires us to estimate our current tax exposure and to assess temporary differences that result from differing treatments of certain items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which we show on our balance sheet we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized to the extent we believe that realization is not likely we establish a valuation allowance when we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in an accounting period we record a corresponding tax expense in our statement of operations 

our net deferred tax asset at july 31 2006 was 1919 million net of the valuation allowance of 44 million we recorded the valuation allowance to reflect uncertainties about whether we will be able to utilize some of our deferred tax assets consisting primarily of certain state capital loss and net operating loss carryforwards before they expire the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income for the jurisdictions in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be realizable while we have considered future taxable income in assessing the need for the valuation allowance we could be required to increase the valuation allowance to take into account additional deferred tax assets that we may be unable to realize an increase in the valuation allowance would have an adverse impact which could be material on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which we make the increase 

results of operations 

financial overview 

 

total net revenue increased 15 in fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005 driven by strong growth in our consumer tax and payroll and payments segments consumer tax revenue was 25 higher in fiscal 2006 driven by a 57 increase in federal turbotax online units sold and to a lesser extent by growth in revenue from attach services such as electronic filing payroll and payments revenue increased 24 in fiscal 2006 see “total net revenue” below for additional information 

effective august 1 2005 we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas 123r “sharebased payment” using the modified prospective transition method under that transition method compensation expense that we recognized for the twelve months ended july 31 2006 included a period compensation expense for all sharebased payments granted prior to but not yet vested as of august 1 2005 based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas 123 adjusted for estimated forfeitures and b period compensation expense for all sharebased payments granted on or after august 1 2005 based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas 123r in fiscal 2006 we recorded pretax sharebased compensation expense for stock options and our employee stock purchase plan totaling 660 million or 012 per diluted share as a result of our adoption of sfas 123r because we elected to use the modified prospective transition method results for prior periods have not been restated 

at july 31 2006 there was 1036 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested sharebased compensation arrangements granted under all equity compensation plans which we will amortize to expense in the future total unrecognized compensation cost will be adjusted for future changes in estimated forfeitures we expect to recognize that cost over a weighted average vesting period of 22 years 

excluding the sharebased compensation expense for stock options and our employee stock purchase plan that we recorded in accordance with sfas 123r higher revenue in fiscal 2006 was partially offset by higher expenses of approximately 75 million for new product development and approximately 60 million for additional advertising and other marketing programs and improved customer support service levels our effective tax rate for fiscal 2006 was approximately 38 compared with approximately 33 for fiscal 2005 in fiscal 2005 our effective tax rate benefited from the reversal of approximately 257 million in reserves related to potential income tax exposures that were resolved if we had excluded these and other discrete tax benefits from our fiscal 2005 effective tax rate our effective tax rate for fiscal 2005 would have been approximately five percentage points higher and our net income from continuing operations for that period would have been approximately 30 million lower our diluted net income per share from continuing operations increased more rapidly than our net income from continuing operations in fiscal 2006 due to the net reduction of average shares outstanding average shares outstanding declined as a result of repurchases of 310 million shares under our stock repurchase programs partially offset by the issuance of 166 million shares in connection with the exercise of stock options and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan 

in december 2005 we sold our intuit information technology solutions its business for approximately 200 million in cash the buyer deposited approximately 20 million of the total purchase price in a thirdparty escrow account to be held through december 2006 to cover breaches of representations and warranties set forth in the purchase agreement should they arise the full escrow amount is included in other current assets on our balance sheet at july 31 2006 we recorded total net income from its discontinued operations of 395 million or 011 per diluted share in fiscal 2006 including 343 million or 010 per diluted share for the net gain on disposal of that business 

in may 2006 we sold our master builder construction management software and solutions business which was part of intuit construction business solutions in our other businesses segment the master builder business had quarterly revenue of approximately 5 million we recorded a 77 million net loss on disposal of the business including income tax expense of 101 million in accordance with the provisions of sfas 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” we have not accounted for this transaction as a discontinued operation 

at july 31 2006 our cash cash equivalents and investments totaled 12 billion an increase of 2029 million from july 31 2005 in fiscal 2006 we generated 5955 million in cash from continuing operations approximately 200 million in cash from the sale of our its business and 2793 million in cash from the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans during the same period we repurchased 310 million shares of our common stock under our repurchase programs at an average price of 2528 for a total price of 7842 million at july 31 2006 authorized funds of 5066 million remained available for stock repurchases 

total net revenue 

the table below and the discussion of total net revenue that follows it are organized in accordance with our five reportable business segments see note 8 to the financial statements for descriptions of product service and other revenue for each segment 

in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 we revised our reportable segments to reflect the way we currently manage and view our business we transferred our quickbooks payroll and merchant services businesses from our fiscal 2005 quickbooksrelated segment to a new segment called payroll and payments and renamed our quickbooksrelated segment quickbooks we also transferred our outsourced payroll business from our fiscal 2005 intuitbranded small business segment to the new payroll and payments segment finally we transferred the remaining businesses in our fiscal 2005 intuitbranded small business segment to our other businesses segment we made no changes to our consumer tax and professional tax segments we have reclassified previously reported fiscal 2005 and 2004 segment results to be consistent with the fiscal 2006 presentation 

 

total net revenue by business segment 

quickbooks 

fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005  quickbooks total net revenue increased 316 million or 6 in fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005 total quickbooks software unit sales were up 14 in fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005 this higher unit volume more than offset lower average selling prices for quickbooks software due to price reductions for new users and the elimination of upgrade rebates we believe that the higher unit volume was a result of product improvements successful execution of our quickbooks 2006 product launch and growth in the category that was driven by publicity surrounding a significant new market entrant 

fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004 quickbooks total net revenue increased 297 million or 6 in fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004 on 18 higher unit volume resulting from an increase in new customers and on proportionately more sales of our higher priced products favorable product mix 

payroll and payments 

fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005  payroll and payments total net revenue increased 902 million or 24 in fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005 our combined payroll offerings accounted for slightly more than half of the fiscal 2006 revenue increase while our merchant services represented slightly less than half of the revenue increase quickbooks payroll revenue was 23 higher in fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005 because of a combination of favorable product mix 7 growth in the customer base and the residual effects of a price increase that we implemented in fiscal 2005 revenue from our other payroll offerings increased 11 in fiscal 2006 driven by 17 growth in the number of quickbooks assisted payroll and complete payroll customers processing payrolls price increases and increased interest income on funds held for payroll customers partially offset by attrition in the premier payroll service customer base merchant services revenue increased 47 in fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005 due to 32 growth in the customer base and 18 higher transaction volume per customer in fiscal 2006 

fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004 payroll and payments total net revenue increased 805 million or 28 in fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004 our merchant services accounted for slightly more than half of the fiscal 2005 revenue increase while our combined payroll offerings represented slightly less than half of the revenue increase the 99 increase in merchant services revenue was due to growth in the customer base higher transaction volume per customer and our discontinuation of the outsourcing of certain merchant processing services beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 in fiscal 2005 we completed the transition to recognizing the full revenue from processing merchant transactions that were formerly processed through two major banks rather than the smaller profitsharing fees we would have received under our prior arrangement with those banks we recorded fees for outsourced merchant processing services as other revenue while we recorded fees for merchant processing services we perform ourselves as service revenue quickbooks payroll revenue was 20 higher in fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004 because of growth in the customer base price increases and the successful launch of our higherpriced enhanced payroll offering including its bundling with unspecified quickbooks software upgrades revenue from our other payroll businesses increased 10 in fiscal 2005 driven by growth in the number of quickbooks assisted payroll and complete payroll customers processing payrolls price increases and higher interest income on funds held for payroll customers partially offset by attrition in the premier payroll service customer base 

consumer tax 

fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005 consumer tax total net revenue increased 1398 million or 25 in fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005 paid federal turbotax unit sales were up 20 in fiscal 2006 driven by a 57 increase in federal turbotax online units sold which accounted for the majority of the revenue increase for that period to a lesser extent higher fiscal 2006 revenue was due to growth in revenue from attach services such as electronic filing we believe that the continuing trend among individual taxpayers toward the use of both online and desktop software rather than manual methods to prepare their own income tax returns will continue to be important to the growth of our consumer tax business we also believe that fiscal 2006 consumer tax revenue growth was positively affected by changes in our offering and pricing strategies that included eliminating rebates and bundling federal and state consumer tax products these changes were designed to simplify our offerings in response to customer feedback 

fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004  consumer tax total net revenue increased 807 million or 16 in fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004 due to 20 higher federal turbotax online units and to volume and price increases in electronic filing and other attach services 

professional tax 

fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005 professional tax total net revenue increased 79 million or 3 in fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005 due to overall growth in the professional tax customer base that was partially offset by a shift in product mix toward our lower priced offerings 

fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004  professional tax total net revenue increased 131 million or 5 in fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004 due to an increase in lacerte product revenue driven by improved customer retention rates and to bank product transmission services volume from our new proseries express product 

other businesses 

fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005 other businesses total net revenue increased 351 million or 11 in fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005 quicken revenue was 3 lower in fiscal 2006 canadian revenue increased 23 in fiscal 2006 due to strong growth in sales of quickbooks products and to a lesser extent to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 

fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004  other businesses total net revenue increased 315 million or 11 in fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004 quicken revenue was 3 higher in fiscal 2005 due to growth in our bill payment customer base canadian revenue increased 17 in fiscal 2005 due to market share gains for quickbooks software and higher subscription revenue for payroll services that was driven by improvements in service levels 

cost of revenue 

 

our cost of revenue has four components 1 cost of product revenue which includes the direct costs of manufacturing and shipping our software products 2 cost of service revenue which reflects direct costs associated with providing services including data center costs related to delivering internetbased services 3 cost of other revenue which includes costs associated with revenue sharing and online transactions revenue and 4 amortization of purchased intangible assets which represents the cost of amortizing over their useful lives developed technologies that we obtained through acquisitions 

fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005 cost of product revenue as a percentage of product revenue was the same in fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005 growth in turbotax units came disproportionately through our web turbotax offer which has lower costs per unit than our desktop offerings this was offset by higher cost of product revenue in our quickbooks segment which resulted from 14 quickbooks unit growth cost of service revenue as a percentage of service revenue was the same in fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005 growth in our consumer tax electronic filing revenue assisted payroll revenue and merchant services revenue all of which had lower relative cost increases associated with their related revenue increases was offset by higher costs in our quickbooks segment which resulted from improvements in service levels for technical support plan customers 

fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004  cost of service revenue as a percentage of service revenue decreased in fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004 due to growth in our consumer tax electronic filing revenue and merchant services revenue both of which had minimal cost increases associated with the related revenue increases and to customer service efficiencies in our small business payroll business 

operating expenses 

 

individually and in the aggregate operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenue were generally consistent in the periods presented total operating expenses in dollars increased 2161 million in fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005 sharebased compensation expense for stock options and our employee stock purchase plan that we recorded as a result of our adoption of sfas 123r on august 1 2005 accounted for 630 million of that increase in fiscal 2006 total operating expenses also increased by approximately 75 million for new product development and approximately 60 million for additional advertising and other marketing programs and improved customer support service levels particularly in our quickbooks and consumer tax segments excluding the impact of sharebased compensation expense sales and marketing expense as a percentage of revenue declined due to lower direct selling costs associated with our fiscal 2006 focus on the retail channel we continue to invest in research and development and expect that our fiscal 2007 research and development expenses as a percentage of total net revenue will be higher than they were in fiscal 2006 total operating expenses in dollars increased 1111 million in fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004 due to spending for infrastructure implementation of our new information systems new product development and promotion and sarbanesoxley compliance 

segment operating income loss 

segment operating income or loss is segment net revenue less segment cost of revenue and operating expenses segment expenses do not include certain costs such as corporate general and administrative expenses and sharebased compensation expenses which are not allocated to specific segments these unallocated costs totaled 4663 million in fiscal 2006 3830 million in fiscal 2005 and 3447 million in fiscal 2004 sharebased compensation expenses for stock options and our employee stock purchase plan that we began recording in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 accounted for 660 million of the increase in unallocated costs for fiscal 2006 see note 1 and note 12 to the financial statements segment expenses also do not include amortization of purchased intangible assets acquisitionrelated charges and impairment of goodwill and purchased intangible assets in addition segment expenses do not include interest and other income and realized net gains or losses on marketable equity securities and other investments see note 8 to the financial statements for reconciliations of total segment operating income to income from continuing operations for each fiscal year presented 

 

quickbooks 

fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005 quickbooks segment operating income and segment operating income as a percentage of related revenue decreased in fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005 higher fiscal 2006 quickbooks revenue resulted from higher unit volume that more than offset the impact of lower average selling prices however lower average selling prices yielded lower profit per unit higher unit volume in fiscal 2006 resulted in higher customer support costs we also spent more on quickbooks product development and on improvements to technical support service levels in fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005 

fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004  quickbooks segment operating income as a percentage of related revenue was the same in fiscal 2005 and 2004 the fiscal 2005 revenue increase of 6 was offset by increased spending for quickbooks product development technical support and marketing 

payroll and payments 

fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005 payroll and payments segment operating income as a percentage of related revenue increased in fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005 more of the revenue growth in that segment came from products and services with lower costs of revenue such as quickbooks payroll and merchant services 

fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004 payroll and payments segment operating income as a percentage of related revenue increased in fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004 more of the revenue growth in that segment came from products and services with lower costs of revenue such as quickbooks payroll and merchant services outsourced payroll revenue growth combined with customer service efficiencies the consolidation of regional sales facilities and a reorganization of the sales force that resulted in lower spending in that business also contributed to the improvement in segment operating income in fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004 

consumer tax 

fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005 consumer tax segment operating income as a percentage of related revenue was nearly the same in fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005 higher revenue and lower rebate processing fees were partially offset by higher expenses for television and web advertising and to a lesser extent for product development and customer support in fiscal 2006 

fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004 consumer tax segment operating income as a percentage of related revenue was slightly higher in fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004 higher revenue from turbotax federal units and volume and price increases in electronic filing and refund transfer services was offset by higher expenses for advertising product development customer support and retail merchandising 

professional tax 

fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005 professional tax segment operating income as a percentage of related revenue was the same in fiscal 2006 and 2005 revenue and operating expenses were similar in the two periods 

fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004 professional tax segment operating income as a percentage of related revenue decreased in fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004 a 5 revenue increase was more than offset by higher spending for overall customer support and for product development and marketing related to our new proseries basic and proseries express products in fiscal 2005 

other businesses 

fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005 other businesses segment operating income as a percentage of related revenue was the same in fiscal 2006 and 2005 quicken revenue was slightly lower while expenses to develop and market new offerings increased in fiscal 2006 higher revenue combined with relatively stable spending produced better operating margins in canada 

fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004 other businesses segment operating income as a percentage of related revenue increased in fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004 quicken revenue was higher while quicken cost of revenue was relatively flat in fiscal 2005 due to savings resulting from the outsourcing of our quickencom web site higher revenue and relatively stable spending resulted in an increase in segment operating income in canada 

nonoperating income and expenses 

interest and other income 

 

higher interest rates and slightly higher average invested balances resulted in increases in interest income in fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005 and in fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004 total interest and other income for all periods presented included royalties from trademark license and distribution agreements that we entered into when we sold our quicken loans mortgage business in july 2002 

income taxes 

our effective tax rate was approximately 38 for fiscal 2006 approximately 33 for fiscal 2005 and approximately 28 for fiscal 2004 our effective tax rate for fiscal 2006 differed from the federal statutory rate due to state income taxes and the taxable gain on the sale of our master builder business which were partially offset by the benefit we received from tax exempt interest income federal and state research and experimental credits and the domestic production activities deduction our effective tax rate for fiscal 2005 differed from the federal statutory rate due to the net effect of the reversal of 257 million in reserves related to potential income tax exposures that were resolved the federal research and experimental credit and to the benefit received from taxexempt interest income offset by state taxes our effective tax rate for fiscal 2004 differed from the federal statutory rate due to the net effect of the reversal of 357 million in reserves related to potential income tax exposures that were resolved the federal research and experimental credit and to the benefit received from taxexempt interest income offset by state taxes and acquisitionrelated charges see note 11 to the financial statements 

at july 31 2006 we had net deferred tax assets of 1919 million which included a valuation allowance of 44 million for certain state capital loss and net operating loss carryforwards the allowance reflects management’s assessment that we may not receive the benefit of certain loss carryforwards in certain state jurisdictions while we believe our current valuation allowance is sufficient it may be necessary to increase this amount if it becomes more likely that we will not realize a greater portion of the net deferred tax assets we assess the need for an adjustment to the valuation allowance on a quarterly basis see note 11 to the financial statements

statements of a voluntary change in accounting principle unless it is impracticable apb 20 previously required that most voluntary changes in accounting principle be recognized by including in net income of the period of the change the cumulative effect of changing to the new accounting principle sfas 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december 15 2005 earlier application is permitted for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after june 1 2005 we will adopt sfas 154 on august 1 2006 and we do not expect our adoption of this new standard to have a material impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

sfas 155  “accounting for certain hybrid instruments” 

in february 2006 the fasb issued sfas 155 “accounting for certain hybrid instruments” which amends sfas 133 “accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities” and sfas 140 “accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities” sfas 155 allows financial instruments that have embedded derivatives to be accounted for as a whole eliminating the need to bifurcate the derivative from its host if the holder elects to account for the whole instrument on a fair value basis sfas 155 also clarifies and amends certain other provisions of sfas 133 and sfas 140 this statement is effective for all financial instruments acquired or issued in fiscal years beginning after september 15 2006 we do not expect our adoption of this new standard to have a material impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

fin 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes” 

in june 2006 the fasb issued financial interpretation no fin 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes” fin 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements in accordance with sfas 109 “ accounting for income taxes” fin 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return it also provides guidance on derecognition classification interest and penalties accounting in interim periods disclosure and transition the requirements of fin 48 are effective for our fiscal year beginning august 1 2007 we are in the process of evaluating this guidance and therefore have not yet determined the impact that fin 48 will have on our financial position or results of operations upon adoption 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

investment portfolio 

we do not hold derivative financial instruments in our portfolio of investments and funds held for payroll customers our investments and funds held for payroll customers consist of instruments that meet quality standards consistent with our investment policy this policy specifies that except for direct obligations of the united states government securities issued by agencies of the united states government and money market or cash management funds we diversify our holdings by limiting our investments and funds held for payroll customers with any individual issuer 

the following table presents our portfolio of cash equivalents and investments as of july 31 2006 by stated maturity the table is classified by the original maturity date listed on the security and includes cash equivalents and investments that are part of funds held for payroll customers on our balance sheet cash equivalents consist primarily of money market funds approximately 93 of our availableforsale debt securities have an interest reset date put date or mandatory call date within one year at july 31 2006 the weighted average interest rate earned on our money market accounts was 517 and the weighted average interest rate earned on our investments was 632 

 

interest rate risk 

our cash equivalents and our portfolio of investments and funds held for payroll customers are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates interest rate movements affect the interest income we earn on cash equivalents investments and funds held for payroll customers and the value of those investments should the federal reserve target rate increase by 10 or about 53 basis points from the level of july 31 2006 the value of our investments and funds held for payroll customers would decline by approximately 14 million should interest rates increase by 100 basis points from the level of july 31 2006 the value of our investments and funds held for payroll customers would decline by approximately 26 million 

impact of foreign currency rate changes 

the functional currency of our international operating subsidiaries is the local currency assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date revenue costs and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange in effect during the period we report translation gains and losses as a separate component of stockholders’ equity we include net gains and losses resulting from foreign exchange transactions in our statements of operations 

since we translate foreign currencies primarily canadian dollars and british pounds into us dollars for financial reporting purposes currency fluctuations can have an impact on our financial results the historical impact of currency fluctuations has generally been immaterial we believe that our exposure to currency exchange fluctuation risk is not significant primarily because our global subsidiaries invoice customers and satisfy their financial obligations almost exclusively in their local currencies although the impact of currency fluctuations on our financial results has generally been immaterial in the past and we believe that for the reasons cited above currency fluctuations will not be significant in the future there can be no guarantee that the impact of currency fluctuations will not be material in the future as of july 31 2006 we did not engage in foreign currency hedging activities

product development 

since the personal computer and software industries are characterized by rapid technological change shifting customer needs and frequent new product introductions and enhancements a continuous high level of investment is required for the enhancement of existing products and the development of new products we develop the majority of our products internally we may also supplement our internal development efforts by acquiring strategically important products and technology from third parties or establishing other relationships that enable us to enhance or expand our offerings more rapidly we have a number of united states patents and pending applications that relate to various aspects of our products and technology while we believe that our patents have value no single patent is essential to any of our business segments 

our core desktop software products quickbooks turbotax lacerte proseries and quicken tend to have fairly predictable structured development cycles of about a year with annual product releases these businesses also develop new products whose development cycles are less predictable developing consumer and professional tax software presents unique challenges because of the demanding development cycle required to accurately incorporate tax law and tax form changes within a rigid timetable the development timing for our outsourced payroll offerings is determined by business needs and regulatory requirements and the length of the development cycle depends on the scope and complexity of each particular project the product development cycles for the other businesses in our intuitbranded small business segment also vary and can be longer than one year for major product releases 

over the next few years we expect that we will be developing more versions of more products than ever before we anticipate that these products will offer increased ease of use be customized for specific customer categories and feature improved integration with other intuit and third party products and services and with our internal information systems our research and development efforts will be focused on developing new products and services to address customer needs in our more broadly defined markets 

8 as well as adding complementary products and services to drive revenue from our core products we also expect to continue to focus significant research and development efforts on multiyear projects to modernize the software platforms for many of our products our research and development expenses were 3052 million in fiscal 2005 2760 million in fiscal 2004 and 2507 million in fiscal 2003 and represented approximately 15 of total net revenue in each of those periods 

seasonality 

our quickbooks consumer tax and professional tax businesses are highly seasonal some of our other offerings such as quicken are also seasonal but to a lesser extent revenue from upgrades for many of our small business software products including quickbooks tend to be concentrated around calendar year end sales of income tax preparation products and services are heavily concentrated in the period from november through april these seasonal patterns mean that our total net revenue is usually highest during our second fiscal quarter ending january 31 and third fiscal quarter ending april 30 we typically report losses in our first fiscal quarter ending october 31 and fourth fiscal quarter ending july 31 when revenue from our tax businesses is minimal while operating expenses continue at relatively consistent levels 

marketing sales and distribution 

markets 

our primary target markets are small businesses with up to 250 employees consumer and professional tax and accountants in addition we have acquired several companies that offer business management solutions to larger businesses these include outsourced payroll intuit real estate solutions intuit distribution management solutions and intuit construction business solutions 

many of the markets in which we compete are characterized by rapid technological change shifting customer needs and frequent new product introductions and enhancements by competitors market and industry changes can quickly render existing products and services obsolete so our success depends on our ability to respond rapidly to these changes with new business models updated competitive strategies new or enhanced products and services alternative distribution methods and other changes in the way we do business 

marketing programs 

we use a variety of marketing programs to generate software orders stimulate demand and generally maintain and increase customer awareness of our products and services these programs include mail email and telephone solicitations directresponse newspaper and magazine advertising and television and radio advertising we also use workflowintegrated inproduct messaging in some of our software products to market other related products and services including thirdparty products and services customers who respond to direct marketing campaigns and inproduct messaging can purchase products and services from us by telephone through our web sites or through our retail partners 

sales and distribution channels 

direct sales channel we sell many of our products and services directly to our customers through our web sites call centers and direct sales force over the past few years we have introduced more sophisticated higherpriced software products and business management solutions including solutions for businesses in selected industries as a result we have been enhancing our direct sales force capabilities to support revenue growth in these areas 

retail distribution channel we market our quickbooks turbotax and quicken desktop software at retail in north america primarily through office supply superstores warehouse clubs consumer electronics retailers general mass merchandisers catalogers and food and drug retailers in international markets we 

9 also rely on distributors valueadded resellers and other third parties who sell products into the retail channel 

we continue to benefit from strong relationships with a number of major north american retailers which allows us to minimize our dependence on any specific retailer we deliver products to larger retailers through a combination of direct to store deliveries and shipments to central warehouse locations we also ship products for many of our smaller retail customers through distributors see “manufacturing and distribution” later in this item 1 we continue to aggressively manage our inventory to optimize instock presence and ensure good product placement within retail stores in response to current retail trends we are also placing a greater proportion of inventory with retailers on a consignment basis 

as we continue to execute on the right for me strategy in each of our businesses we are in some product areas offering software products that are more complex and have higher prices than our traditional retail software products our recent tailoring of some of these software products to specific customer needs including industryspecific versions of quickbooks is also resulting in a greater number of intuit products we produce and place instore displays and other retail merchandising aids that educate customers about product functionality and benefits 

oem channel we have relationships with a number of personal computer “original equipment manufacturers” or oems including dell inc apple computer inc and hewlettpackard although aggregate revenue from our oem channel is much less significant than revenue from our other distribution channels oem relationships help us to generate sales of our core desktop software products in two ways first some oems “prebundle” newuser versions of certain desktop software products on the computer systems that the oems sell to their customers these prebundled oem sales are a good source of new customers and future revenues second the other source of revenue from the oem channel is “afterpoint of sale” programs in which customers who have purchased computers with newuser versions of intuit software that are preinstalled on the desktop can select and purchase additional software products from a suite of offerings at a later date 

thirdparty “valueadded” distribution arrangements we supplement our direct sales capabilities and our retail and oem distribution relationships with selected thirdparty distribution arrangements we believe these relationships will enhance the growth opportunities for our higherend product and service offerings by allowing us to benefit from the valueadded marketing and sales expertise of these third parties we currently have arrangements with third parties who have specialized expertise in marketing selling and providing postsale implementation services for innovative merchant solutions and some of our intuitbranded small business solutions during fiscal 2006 and beyond we expect to continue to optimize expand and support our network of thirdparty relationships 

competition 

overview 

we face intense competition in all of our businesses both domestically and internationally competitive interest and expertise in many of the markets we serve particularly small business and consumer tax has grown markedly over the past few years and we expect this trend to continue some of our existing competitors have significantly greater financial technical and marketing resources than we do as we implement our customerdriven strategies we face increased competitive threats from larger companies than we have historically faced in addition the competitive landscape can shift rapidly as new companies enter markets in which we compete 

our most obvious competition comes from other companies that offer technology solutions similar to ours these competitors are shown in the table below however for many of our products and services other important competitive alternatives for customers are manual tools and processes or generalpurpose software many of our new customers have used pencil and paper or software such as word processors and spreadsheets rather than competitors’ software and services to perform financial tasks for example many 

10 taxpayers prepared their tax returns manually before using turbotax a large number of small businesses used spreadsheets to keep their books and they processed their payroll using spreadsheets and manuallywritten checks before purchasing quickbooks and most of our personal finance customers tracked their finances with spreadsheets manually or not at all before using quicken 

consumer tax in the private sector we face intense competition primarily from hr block the makers of taxcut software and increasingly from webbased competitive offerings where we are subject to significant and increasing price pressure we also compete for customers with lowcost assisted tax preparation businesses such as hr block 

we also face potential competitive challenges in our consumer tax business from publicly funded government entities that offer electronic tax preparation and filing services at no cost to individual taxpayers we are a member of the free file alliance a consortium of private sector companies that signed a threeyear agreement with the federal government in october 2002 under this agreement a number of private sector companies rather than the federal government have been providing webbased federal tax preparation and filing services at no cost to federal taxpayers through voluntary public service initiatives such as our intuit tax freedom project the agreement is currently under negotiation by the federal government and the free file alliance for possible changes a number of states have adopted similar publicprivate agreements modeled after the free file alliance however many other states have taken the opposite approach and offer some form of directly sponsored tax preparation and filing services free to qualified taxpayers we continue to actively work with others in the private and public sectors to advance the goals of the free file alliance policy initiative and to support successful publicprivate partnership however future administrative regulatory or legislative activity in this area could have a material adverse effect on our consumer tax business 

quickbooksrelated quickbooks is the leading product in the retail sales channel for its category we face potential competitive challenges in our quickbooksrelated business from microsoft corporation which has announced its intention to target small business customers with accounting software and associated services 

competitive factors for desktop software we believe the most important competitive factors for our desktop software products – quickbooks turbotax lacerte proseries and quicken – are ease of use product features size of the installed customer base brand name recognition value and product and support quality access to distribution channels is also important for our quickbooks turbotax and quicken products in addition the ability for customers to upgrade within product families as their businesses grow is a significant competitive factor for our quickbooks products we believe we compete effectively on these factors as quickbooks turbotax and quicken products are the leading products in the retail sales channel for their respective categories 

products and services other than desktop software we believe the most important competitive factors for products and services other than desktop software are features and ease of use brand name recognition speed in getting new products and services to market effective distribution and quality of implementation and support we believe we compete effectively on these factors for our service offerings such as outsourced payroll and merchant services service reliability and scalability of operations are also important factors due to the size of our principal competitors in these service businesses we will need to scale our businesses to compete effectively over the long term significant competitive factors for our financial supplies business include ordering convenience product quality speed of delivery and price we believe that our convenient access to our large quickbooks and quicken customer bases is a significant competitive advantage for our financial supplies business 

11 competitors 

the following table shows the significant competitors for each of our major products and services 

 customer service and technical support 

we provide customer service and technical support by telephone online chat fax email and our customer service and technical support web sites we have fulltime and outsourced customer service and technical support staffs which we supplement with seasonal employees and additional outsourcing during periods of peak call volumes such as during the tax return filing season or following a major product launch we outsource to several firms domestically and internationally most of our internationally outsourced consumer and small business customer service and technical support personnel are located in india 

we offer free selfhelp information through our technical support web sites for quickbooks turbotax and quicken for example customers can use our web sites to find answers to commonly asked questions and check on the status of orders under support plans customers can also use our web sites to receive product updates electronically support alternatives and fees vary by product we also sponsor online user communities where customers can share product advice with each other 

manufacturing and distribution 

desktop software and supplies 

the major steps involved in manufacturing desktop software are manufacturing cds printing boxes and related materials and assembling and shipping the final products we have a manufacturing agreement with moduslink corp under which moduslink provides substantially all outsourced manufacturing related to our retail launches of quickbooks turbotax and quicken as well as for daytoday retail order fulfillment after product launches although moduslink has operations in multiple locations that can provide redundancy if necessary we have centralized the manufacturing for our retail products in one of 

12 their facilities which is colocated with our primary retail fulfillment vendor ingram micro logistics iml a division of ingram micro inc we also outsource the product manufacturing and distribution for all of our direct sales orders to arvato services inc a division of bertelsmann ag we use john h harland company exclusively to fulfill orders for all of our printed checks and most other products for our financial supplies business 

our retail product launches are operationally complex our model for product delivery for retail launches and replenishment is a hybrid of direct to store deliveries and shipments to central warehouse locations this allows improved inventory management by our retailers we also ship products for many of our smaller retail customers through distributors we have an agreement with iml under which iml handles all logistics fulfillment and similar functions for our retail sales 

we have multiple sources for all of our raw materials and availability has historically not been a significant problem for us prior to major product releases for our core desktop software products we tend to have significant levels of backlog but at other times backlog is minimal and we typically ship products within a few days of receiving an order because of this fluctuation in backlog we believe that backlog is not a reliable predictor of our future core desktop software sales 

internetbased products and services 

intuit’s data centers house most of the systems networks and databases required to operate and deliver our internetbased products and services these include quickbooks online edition quickbooks assisted payroll service complete webbased payroll turbotax for the web consumer and professional electronic tax filing services quickencom and quickbase through our data centers we connect customers to products and services and we store the vast amount of data that represents the content on our web sites as our businesses continue to move toward delivering more webbased products and services this infrastructure will become even more critical in the future our data centers consist of numerous servers and databases located in several sites across the united states in an effort to reduce unavailability or “down time” for our internetbased products and services we generally follow industrystandard practices for creating a faulttolerant environment but we do not have complete redundancy we have backup processing capabilities that are designed to protect us against siterelated disasters for many of our missioncritical applications despite our efforts to maintain continuous and reliable server operations we occasionally experience unplanned outages or technical difficulties 

privacy and security of customer information 

we are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations and financial institution requirements relating to privacy and security we are also subject to laws and regulations that apply to telemarketing and email activities additional laws in both areas are likely to be passed in the future which could result in significant limitations on the ways in which we can communicate with our customers and significantly increase our compliance costs 

we comply with federal guidelines and practices to help ensure that customers are aware of and can control how we use information about them our primary web sites such as quickbookscom turbotaxcom and quickencom have been certified by truste an independent nonprofit organization that operates a web site certification program to alleviate users’ concerns about online privacy we also use privacy statements to provide notice to customers of our privacy practices as well as provide them the opportunity to furnish instructions with respect to use of their data 

to address security concerns we use industrystandard security safeguards to help protect the information customers give to us from loss misuse and unauthorized alteration whenever customers transmit sensitive information such as a credit card number or tax return data to us through one of our web sites we provide them access to our servers that allow encryption of the information as it is transmitted to us we work to protect personally identifiable information stored on the web site’s servers from unauthorized 

13 access using commercially available computer security products such as firewalls as well as internally developed security procedures and practices 

government regulation 

we offer certain products and services such as outsourced payroll which are subject to special regulatory requirements as we expand our small business products and services we may become subject to additional government regulation particularly in the areas of retirement planning and other employer services new laws or regulations may be adopted in these areas that could impose significant limitations on our business and increase our cost of compliance we continually analyze new business opportunities and new businesses that we pursue may require additional costs for regulatory compliance 

intellectual property 

we regard our products as proprietary we attempt to protect our product technology by relying on a combination of copyright patent trade secret and trademark laws restrictions on disclosure and other methods in particular we have a substantial number of registered trademarks including intuit quickbooks turbotax lacerte proseries and quicken we have registered these and other trademarks and service marks in the united states and depending on the relevance of each brand to other markets in many foreign countries the initial duration of trademark registrations varies from country to country and is 10 years in the united states most registrations can be renewed perpetually at 10year intervals we also currently hold a small but growing patent portfolio we regularly file applications for patents and trademarks and service marks in order to protect proprietary intellectual property that we believe is important to our business we also license some intellectual property from third parties for use in our products 

we face a number of risks relating to our intellectual property including unauthorized use and unauthorized copying or piracy of our products litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights to protect trade secrets or trademarks or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others patents that have been issued to us could be determined to be invalid and may not be enforceable against competitive products in every jurisdiction furthermore other parties have asserted and may in the future assert infringement claims against us for further discussion of our current litigation see item 3 legal proceedings these claims and any litigation may result in invalidation of our proprietary rights litigation even if not meritorious could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention in addition third party licenses may not continue to be available to us on commercially acceptable terms or at all 

employees 

as of august 31 2005 we had approximately 7000 employees located in the united states and internationally in canada the united kingdom and several other locations we believe our future success and growth will depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees in all areas of our business we do not currently have any collective bargaining agreements with our employees and we believe employee relations are generally good although we have employmentrelated agreements with a number of key employees these agreements do not guarantee continued service we believe we offer competitive compensation and a good working environment we were selected as one of fortune magazine’s “100 best companies to work for” in april 2002 2003 2004 and 2005 however we face intense competition for qualified employees and we expect to face continuing challenges in recruiting and retention 










 item 2 

properties 

our principal locations their purposes and the expiration dates for the leases on facilities at those locations as of july 31 2005 are shown in the table below we have renewal options on many of our leases 

 the leases for our existing san diego california facilities expire in 2007 in march 2005 we entered into an agreement under which we will lease approximately 365000 square feet of office space in three fourstory buildings to be constructed by the landlord in san diego we also have a right of first offer to lease one or more floors of a fourth fourstory building for approximately 101000 square feet at the same location and a right of first refusal with respect to any remaining space in the fourth building the lease term will begin on september 1 2007 and end on the later of august 31 2017 or ten years after the date we first occupy the buildings we have two options to extend the lease for a period of five years each 

in addition our three industry solutions businesses lease their principal facilities in santa rosa california boulder colorado shelton connecticut hyannis massachusetts and highland hills ohio they also lease sales and service offices across the united states and in selected international locations finally we lease or own facilities in a number of other domestic locations and internationally in the united kingdom and several other locations 

we believe our facilities are adequate for our current and nearterm needs and that we will be able to locate additional facilities as needed see note 11 to the financial statements for more information about our lease commitments

about intuit 

intuit is a leading provider of business and financial management solutions for small business consumer and professional tax and accountants we organize our business into the following five segments 

 21 key accomplishments in fiscal 2005 

in fiscal 2005 we successfully executed growth strategies focused on our core markets of small business consumer and professional tax and accountants this enabled us to acquire more new customers in these markets and sell more products and services to our large base of customers over their lifetime we introduced several new products including quickbooks simple start which provides accounting functionality suitable for very small businesses snaptax designed for taxpayers with very simple personal income tax returns proseries basic edition designed for the needs of smaller and seasonal tax practices proseries express edition designed for tax practices that focus on helping taxpayers obtain their tax refunds quickly quicken medical expense manager and quicken rental property manager 

overview of financial results 

total net revenue for fiscal 2005 was 20 billion up 13 compared with fiscal 2004 the fiscal 2005 revenue increase was primarily due to growth in our quickbooksrelated and consumer tax segments fiscal 2005 net income was 3816 million up 20 compared with fiscal 2004 net income increased in fiscal 2005 primarily due to revenue growth that was partially offset by higher spending for infrastructure implementation of new information systems new product development and promotion and sarbanesoxley compliance diluted net income per share was 203 in fiscal 2005 an increase of 28 compared with fiscal 2004 diluted net income per share grew faster than net income in fiscal 2005 primarily due to the net reduction of average shares outstanding average shares outstanding declined as a result of repurchases of common stock under our stock repurchase programs partially offset by the issuance of shares under option and employee stock purchase plans 

in fiscal 2005 we generated 5900 million in cash from continuing operations compared with 5525 million in fiscal 2004 the fiscal 2005 increase in operating cash flow was primarily due to higher net income from continuing operations we used 7092 million in cash for repurchases of common stock under our stock repurchase programs in fiscal 2005 

seasonality 

our quickbooks consumer tax and professional tax businesses are highly seasonal some of our other offerings are also seasonal but to a lesser extent revenue from upgrades for many of our small business software products including quickbooks tends to be concentrated around calendar year end sales of income tax preparation products and services are heavily concentrated in the period from november through april these seasonal patterns mean that our total net revenue is usually highest during our second quarter ending january 31 and third quarter ending april 30 we typically report losses in our first quarter ending october 31 and fourth quarter ending july 31 when revenue from our tax businesses is minimal while operating expenses continue at relatively consistent levels 

strategy and trends 

strategy intuit’s strategy is to apply our customerdriven invention mindset and processes to solve complex customer problems the key to our success is our 20year history of staying focused on customer needs our indepth customer knowledge allows us to make more informed decisions that lead to better products and services for customers 

opportunities in our core markets while we have strong positions in our core markets for quickbooks and turbotax software we believe that there are many more opportunities in the markets for small businesses and individual consumers many small businesses and individuals are using other methods such as manual tools and processes or generalpurpose software in fiscal 2005 we began to explore ways to meet the needs of customers that we have never reached before for example we introduced quickbooks simple start with accounting functionality for very small businesses and snaptax for taxpayers with very simple personal income tax returns we expect to continue this focus in fiscal 2006 and beyond 

22 importance of developing and introducing new products and services to remain competitive and grow in the future we must continue to invest in initiatives aimed at uncovering and meeting new customer needs while enhancing our existing offerings to make them even better 

importance of technology infrastructure our internetbased products and services include quickbooks online edition quickbooks assisted payroll service complete webbased payroll turbotax for the web and consumer and professional electronic tax filing services as our businesses continue to move toward delivering more webbased products and services our technology infrastructure will become even more critical in the future 

competition we have formidable competitors and we expect competition to remain intense during fiscal 2006 and beyond for example microsoft corporation currently offers a number of competitive small business offerings and has indicated that part of its growth strategy is to focus on the small business market microsoft has also announced its intention to target small business customers with accounting software and associated services in our consumer tax business we face the risk of federal and state taxing authorities developing or contracting to provide software or other systems to facilitate tax return preparation and electronic filing at no charge to taxpayers 

critical accounting policies 

in preparing our financial statements we make estimates assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on our net revenue operating income or loss and net income or loss as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our balance sheet we believe that the estimates assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies senior management has reviewed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and their disclosure in this annual report on form 10k with the audit committee of our board of directors 

net revenue – revenue recognition 

we derive revenue from the sale of packaged software products license fees product support professional services outsourced payroll services merchant services transaction fees and multiple element arrangements that may include any combination of these items we follow the appropriate revenue recognition rules for each type of revenue for additional information see “net revenue” in note 1 to the financial statements we generally recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists we have delivered the product or performed the service the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable however determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report for example for multiple element arrangements we must make assumptions and judgments in order to allocate the total price among the various elements we must deliver to determine whether undelivered services are essential to the functionality of the delivered products and services to determine whether vendorspecific evidence of fair value exists for each undelivered element and to determine whether and when each element has been delivered if we were to change any of these assumptions or judgments it could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period amounts for fees collected or invoiced and due relating to arrangements where revenue cannot be recognized are reflected on our balance sheet as deferred revenue and recognized when the applicable revenue recognition criteria are satisfied 

net revenue – return and rebate reserves 

as part of our revenue recognition policy we estimate future product returns and rebate payments and establish reserves against revenue at the time of sale based on these estimates our return policy allows distributors and retailers subject to contractual limitations to return purchased products product returns by distributors and retailers relate primarily to the return of obsolete products in determining our product returns reserves we consider the volume and price mix of products in the retail channel historical return 

23 rates for prior releases of the product trends in retailer inventory and economic trends that might impact customer demand for our products including the competitive environment and the timing of new releases of our products we fully reserve for obsolete products in the distribution channels 

our rebate reserves include distributor and retailer sales incentive rebates and enduser rebates our estimated reserves for distributor and retailer incentive rebates are based on distributors’ and retailers’ actual performance against the terms and conditions of rebate programs which we typically establish annually our reserves for enduser rebates are estimated based on the terms and conditions of the specific promotional rebate program actual sales during the promotion the amount of redemptions received and historical redemption trends by product and by type of promotional program 

in the past actual returns and rebates have approximated and not generally exceeded the reserves that we have established however actual returns and rebates in any future period are inherently uncertain if we were to change our assumptions and estimates our revenue reserves would change which would impact the net revenue we report if actual returns and rebates are significantly greater than the reserves we have established the actual results would decrease our future reported revenue conversely if actual returns and rebates are significantly less than our reserves this would increase our future reported revenue for example if we had increased our fiscal 2005 returns reserves by 1 of nonconsignment sales to retailers for quickbooks turbotax and quicken our fiscal 2005 total net revenue would have been 36 million lower if rebate redemptions for our quickbooks turbotax and quicken products were to increase by 1 our annual total net revenue would decrease by approximately 12 million 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

we make ongoing assumptions relating to the collectibility of our accounts receivable the accounts receivable amount on our balance sheet includes a reserve for accounts that might not be paid in determining the amount of the reserve we consider our historical level of credit losses we also make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations and we assess current economic trends that might impact the level of credit losses in the future our reserves have generally been adequate to cover our actual credit losses however since we cannot reliably predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers we cannot guarantee that our reserves will continue to be adequate if actual credit losses are significantly greater than the reserve we have established that would increase our general and administrative expenses and reduce our reported net income conversely if actual credit losses are significantly less than our reserve this would eventually decrease our general and administrative expenses and increase our reported net income 

goodwill purchased intangible assets and other longlived assets – impairment assessments 

we make judgments about the recoverability of purchased intangible assets and other longlived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an otherthantemporary impairment in the remaining value of the assets recorded on our balance sheet may exist we test the impairment of goodwill annually in our fourth fiscal quarter or more frequently if indicators of impairment arise the timing of the formal annual test may result in charges to our statement of operations in our fourth fiscal quarter that could not have been reasonably foreseen in prior periods in order to estimate the fair value of longlived assets we typically make various assumptions about the future prospects for the business that the asset relates to consider market factors specific to that business and estimate future cash flows to be generated by that business we evaluate cash flows at the lowest operating level and the number of reporting units that we have identified may make impairment more probable than it would be at a company with fewer reporting units and integrated operations following acquisitions based on these assumptions and estimates we determine whether we need to record an impairment charge to reduce the value of the asset stated on our balance sheet to reflect its estimated fair value assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives are complex and often subjective they can be affected by a variety of factors including external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate different assumptions and estimates could 

24 materially impact our reported financial results more conservative assumptions of the anticipated future benefits from these businesses could result in impairment charges which would decrease net income and result in lower asset values on our balance sheet conversely less conservative assumptions could result in smaller or no impairment charges higher net income and higher asset values in fiscal 2004 we recorded an impairment charge of 187 million on goodwill associated with our intuit public sector solutions business which was subsequently sold at july 31 2005 we had 5095 million in goodwill and 697 million in net purchased intangible assets on our balance sheet 

accounting for stockbased incentive programs 

through the end of fiscal 2005 we measured compensation expense for our stockbased incentive programs using the intrinsic value method prescribed by accounting principles board apb opinion no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” under this method we did not record compensation expense when stock options were granted to eligible participants as long as the exercise price was not less than the fair market value of the stock when the option was granted we also did not record compensation expense for shares purchased in connection with our employee stock purchase plan as long as the purchase price of the stock was not less than 85 of the lower of the fair market value of the stock at the beginning of each offering period or at the end of each purchase period in accordance with sfas 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” and sfas 148 “accounting for stockbased compensation – transition and disclosure” we disclosed our pro forma net income or loss and net income or loss per share as if the fair valuebased method had been applied in measuring compensation expense for our stockbased incentive programs 

to determine the pro forma impact of applying sfas 123 we estimated the fair value of our options using the black scholes option valuation model this model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable this model also requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected volatility of our common stock price the assumptions we used for the valuation model are set forth in note 1 to the financial statements 

the appropriate volatility factor for stock options and for our employee stock purchase plan is the estimated future volatility of our stock over the expected life of the options prior to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 we estimated the volatility factors for stock options and for our employee stock purchase plan using the historical volatility of our stock over the most recent fiveyear period from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 through the third quarter of fiscal 2005 we estimated the volatility factors for stock options using the historical volatility of our stock over the most recent threeyear period which was approximately equal to the average expected life of our options during that time we estimated the volatility factors for our employee stock purchase plan using the historical volatility of our stock over the most recent oneyear period which was equal to the length of the offering periods under that plan beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 we estimated the volatility factors for stock options and for our employee stock purchase plan using the implied volatility of our stock we estimated the implied volatility of our stock using the prices of publicly traded options which we believe provides a more accurate estimate of expected volatility factors over the life of the options 

our stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options and changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimates in the future we may elect to use different assumptions under the black scholes valuation model or a different valuation model which could result in a significantly different impact on our net income or loss 

on december 16 2004 the fasb issued sfas 123 revised 2004 “sharebased payment” which is a revision of sfas 123 sfas 123r requires all sharebased payments to employees including grants of employee stock options and purchases under employee stock purchase plans to be recognized in the statement of operations based on their fair values this standard is effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after june 15 2005 we are required to adopt this new standard in the first quarter of our fiscal year ending july 31 2006 the adoption of sfas 123r’s fair value method will have a significant 

25 adverse impact on our net income and net income per share see “recent accounting pronouncements” later in this item 7 

legal contingencies 

we are subject to certain legal proceedings as well as demands claims and threatened litigation that arise in the normal course of our business we review the status of each significant matter quarterly and assess our potential financial exposure if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated we record a liability and an expense for the estimated loss significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination of whether an exposure is reasonably estimable our accruals are based on the best information available at the time as additional information becomes available we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates potential legal liabilities and the revision of estimates of potential legal liabilities could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 

income taxes – estimates of effective tax rates deferred taxes and valuation allowance 

when we prepare our financial statements we estimate our income taxes based on the various jurisdictions where we conduct business significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision we recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the united states and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes will be due we record an additional amount in our provision for income taxes in the period in which we determine that our recorded tax liability is less than we expect the ultimate tax assessment to be if in a later period we determine that payment of this additional amount is unnecessary we reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit in that later period as a result our ongoing assessments of the probable outcomes of the audit issues and related tax positions require judgment and can materially increase or decrease our effective tax rate and materially affect our operating results this also requires us to estimate our current tax exposure and to assess temporary differences that result from differing treatments of certain items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which we show on our balance sheet we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized to the extent we believe that realization is not likely we establish a valuation allowance when we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in an accounting period we record a corresponding tax expense on our statement of operations 

our net deferred tax asset at july 31 2005 was 1733 million net of the valuation allowance of 60 million we recorded the valuation allowance to reflect uncertainties about whether we will be able to utilize some of our deferred tax assets consisting primarily of certain state capital loss carryforwards before they expire the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income for the jurisdictions in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be realizable while we have considered future taxable income in assessing the need for the valuation allowance we could be required to increase the valuation allowance to take into account additional deferred tax assets that we may be unable to realize an increase in the valuation allowance would have an adverse impact which could be material on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which we make the increase 

26 results of operations 

financial overview 

 total net revenue increased in fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004 primarily due to growth in quickbooks quickbooks payroll and innovative merchant solutions merchant services revenue in our quickbooksrelated segment and to growth in turbotax for the web and electronic filing and refund transfer services in our consumer tax segment total net revenue increased in fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003 primarily due to higher quickbooks payroll revenue in our quickbooksrelated segment and to growth in revenue from turbotax for the web and electronic filing services in our consumer tax segment 

operating income from continuing operations grew faster than total net revenue in fiscal 2005 because the increase in total net revenue was only partially offset by higher spending for infrastructure implementation of our new information systems new product development and promotion and sarbanesoxley compliance operating income from continuing operations grew faster than total net revenue in fiscal 2004 primarily due to an increase in revenue from highermargin products such as industryspecific versions of quickbooks and quickbooks payroll and to the fact that we reduced costs while revenue grew in our quicken business 

net income from continuing operations grew more slowly than operating income from continuing operations in fiscal 2005 in fiscal 2004 we reversed 357 million in reserves related to potential income tax exposures that were resolved while in fiscal 2005 we reversed only 257 million of such reserves net income from continuing operations grew at about the same rate as operating income from continuing operations in fiscal 2004 primarily because lower interest and other income and lower gains on marketable equity securities and other investments were offset by our reversal of 357 million in reserves related to potential income tax exposures that were resolved 

diluted net income per share from continuing operations grew faster than net income from continuing operations in fiscal 2005 and 2004 primarily due to the net reduction of average shares outstanding average shares outstanding declined as a result of repurchases of common stock under our stock repurchase programs partially offset by the issuance of shares under option and employee stock purchase plans 

at july 31 2005 our cash cash equivalents and investments totaled 9943 million a decrease of 237 million from july 31 2004 in fiscal 2005 we generated cash primarily from continuing operations and by issuing common stock under employee stock plans we used cash in fiscal 2005 primarily for repurchases of common stock under our stock repurchase programs and capital expenditures in fiscal 2005 we bought 162 million shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs at an average price of 4372 for a total price of 7092 million we completed our fourth stock repurchase program in march 2005 in may 2005 our board of directors authorized us to repurchase up to 5000 million of our common stock from time to time over a threeyear period under a fifth repurchase plan that expires on may 15 2008 at july 31 2005 authorized funds of 2908 million remained available under this fifth stock repurchase program we expect to continue to repurchase shares under this program during fiscal 2006 

27 total net revenue 

the table below and the discussion of total net revenue that follows it are organized in accordance with our five reportable business segments see note 9 to the financial statements for descriptions of product service and other revenue for each segment 

 total net revenue by business segment 

quickbooksrelated 

fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004 quickbooksrelated total net revenue increased in fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004 primarily due to higher quickbooks innovative merchant solutions merchant services and quickbooks payroll revenue quickbooks revenue grew on higher unit volume resulting 

28 primarily from an increase in new customers and on a favorable product mix the increase in merchant services revenue was primarily due to growth in the customer base higher transaction volume per customer and our discontinuation of the outsourcing of certain merchant processing services beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 in fiscal 2005 we completed the transition to recognizing the full revenue from processing merchant transactions that were formerly processed through two major banks rather than the smaller profitsharing fees we would have received under our prior arrangement with those banks quickbooks payroll revenue was higher in fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004 primarily because of growth in the customer base price increases and the successful launch of our higherpriced enhanced payroll plus offering enhanced payroll plus provides quickbooks software upgrades in addition to federal and state tax forms and workers’ compensation tracking 

fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003 quickbooksrelated total net revenue grew in fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003 due to increased sales of higherpriced industryspecific versions of quickbooks and higher quickbooks payroll revenue driven by growth in the average customer base an increase in quickbooksrelated services and the realization in fiscal 2004 of the full impact of a december 2002 price increase the october 2003 acquisition of our innovative merchant solutions merchant services business also contributed to the higher fiscal 2004 total net revenue in this segment 

intuitbranded small business 

fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004 intuitbranded small business total net revenue increased in fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004 primarily due to growth in our outsourced payroll and intuit real estate solutions ires businesses higher outsourced payroll revenue was driven by growth in the number of quickbooks assisted payroll service and complete payroll customers processing payrolls price increases and higher interest income on funds held for payroll customers partially offset by attrition in the premier payroll service customer base the increase in ires revenue was a result of growth in sales to larger customers 

fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003 intuitbranded small business total net revenue increased in fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003 primarily due to new client acquisition in our wholesale durable goods and property management solutions businesses as well as higher average selling prices from increased customer use of support and other services in these businesses 

consumer tax 

fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004 consumer tax total net revenue increased in fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004 primarily due to higher federal turbotax for the web units and to volume and price increases in electronic filing and refund transfer services 

fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003 consumer tax total net revenue increased in fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003 as a result of turbotax for the web and retail desktop unit growth higher attach rates for electronic filing services and higher average selling prices 

professional tax 

fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004 professional tax total net revenue increased in fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004 primarily due to an increase in lacerte product revenue driven by improved customer retention rates and to bank product transmission services volume from our new proseries express product 

fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003 professional tax total net revenue grew slightly in fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003 due to additional sales to existing customers higher average selling prices related to product enhancements and increased sales of our unlimited electronic filing product as a result of new government rules requiring the electronic filing of certain professionally prepared 2003 income tax returns however revenue growth in fiscal 2004 was negatively impacted by competition from lowerpriced professional tax preparation software products 

29 other businesses 

fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004 other businesses total net revenue increased in fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004 quicken service revenue was higher in fiscal 2005 primarily due to the growing base of financial institutions paying for quicken connectivity and growth in our bill payment customer base canadian revenue increased in fiscal 2005 primarily due to market share gains for quickbooks software and higher subscription revenue for payroll services that was driven by improvements in service levels 

fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003 other businesses total net revenue grew slightly in fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003 primarily due to higher quicken revenue 

in fiscal 2004 quicken direct unit sales increased in response to direct mail campaigns for upgrades due to the discontinuation of support for older versions of the product and for turbotax crossselling offers retail unit sales also increased aggregate average selling prices for quicken were higher in fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003 due to a shift in demand to our higherpriced quicken premier and quicken home and business products partially offsetting these increases quicken other revenue declined in fiscal 2004 due to the expiration or termination of contracts with several significant online advertising customers we exited the online advertising business in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 

canadian revenue in us dollars was slightly higher in fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003 due to the favorable effect of the strengthening canadian dollar in fiscal 2004 total net revenue in canadian dollars decreased in fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003 primarily due to lower demand for quickbooks in canada quicktax revenue was also down in fiscal 2004 due to a decline in unit sales that was partially offset by higher average selling prices related to a shift in demand toward the higherpriced specialty versions of that product 

cost of revenue 

 our cost of revenue has four components 1 cost of product revenue which includes the direct costs of manufacturing and shipping our software products 2 cost of service revenue which reflects direct costs associated with providing services including data center costs related to delivering internetbased services 3 cost of other revenue which includes costs associated with generating advertising and online transactions revenue and 4 amortization of purchased intangible assets which represents the cost of amortizing over their useful lives developed technologies that we obtained through acquisitions 

fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004 cost of service revenue as a percentage of service revenue decreased in fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004 primarily due to growth in our consumer tax electronic filing revenue and innovative merchant solutions merchant services revenue both of which had minimal cost increases associated with the related revenue increases and to customer service efficiencies in our outsourced payroll business 

fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003 cost of product revenue as a percentage of product revenue decreased in fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003 this was primarily due to a continuing shift toward 

30 sales of our higherpriced quickbooks products and to lower royalties incurred for our consumer tax and quicken products 

cost of service revenue as a percentage of service revenue decreased in fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003 this decrease was due in part to growth in our consumer tax electronic filing revenue which had minimal incremental costs cost of service revenue as a percentage of service revenue also decreased in fiscal 2004 due to growth in revenue from the highermargin innovative merchant solutions merchant services business we acquired in the first quarter of fiscal 2004 

operating expenses 

 we define core operating expenses as the controllable costs of running our business selling and marketing expenses include the cost of providing customer service and technical support to customers who have not purchased support plans individually and in the aggregate core operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenue were generally consistent in the periods presented total core operating expenses in dollars increased in fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004 primarily due to spending for infrastructure implementation of our new information systems new product development and promotion and sarbanesoxley compliance we plan to continue to upgrade our new information systems to improve performance and support our future growth we also plan to continue to spend for new product development and promotion total core operating expenses in dollars increased in fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003 primarily due to spending for infrastructure and implementation of our new information systems 

31 segment operating income loss 

segment operating income or loss is segment net revenue less segment cost of revenue and operating expenses segment expenses do not include certain costs such as corporate general and administrative expenses that are not allocated to specific segments these unallocated costs totaled 3880 million in fiscal 2005 3485 million in fiscal 2004 and 3183 million in fiscal 2003 in addition segment expenses do not include amortization of purchased intangible assets acquisitionrelated charges and impairment of goodwill and purchased intangible assets segment expenses also do not include interest and other income and realized net gains or losses on marketable equity securities see note 9 to the financial statements for reconciliations of total segment operating income to income from continuing operations for each fiscal year presented 

 quickbooksrelated 

fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004 quickbooksrelated segment operating income as a percentage of related revenue was flat in fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004 the 15 revenue increase compared with fiscal 2004 was offset by increased spending for quickbooks product development technical support and marketing in fiscal 2005 

fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003 quickbooksrelated segment operating income as a percentage of related revenue was flat in fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003 the 18 revenue increase compared with fiscal 2004 included strong growth in our highmargin quickbooks payroll business and the first quarter fiscal 2004 acquisition of innovative merchant solutions the higher fiscal 2004 revenue was offset by increases in spending for quickbooks product development technical support marketing programs and direct sales personnel and infrastructure 

intuitbranded small business 

fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004 our intuitbranded small business segment had operating income in fiscal 2005 after experiencing an operating loss in fiscal 2004 this was primarily due to outsourced payroll revenue growth combined with customer service efficiencies the consolidation of regional sales facilities and a reorganization of the sales force that resulted in lower spending in that business in fiscal 2005 

fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003 our intuitbranded small business segment had a smaller operating loss in fiscal 2004 than it did in fiscal 2003 revenue for this segment grew 11 while we held costs steady in our industry solutions businesses partially offsetting these improvements outsourced payroll operating income was lower in fiscal 2004 because we incurred expenses for additional sales and service personnel during the first half of the year 

32 consumer tax 

fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004 consumer tax segment operating income as a percentage of related revenue was slightly higher in fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004 higher revenue from turbotax federal units and volume and price increases in electronic filing and refund transfer services was offset by higher expenses for advertising product development customer support and retail merchandising 

fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003 consumer tax segment operating income as a percentage of related revenue was flat in fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003 higher revenue and gross margin improvements due to higher average selling prices and growing highmargin service revenues were partially offset by additional costs incurred for national television and radio advertising in fiscal 2004 

professional tax 

fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004 professional tax segment operating income as a percentage of related revenue decreased in fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004 higher revenue was more than offset by higher spending for overall customer support and for product development and marketing related to our new proseries basic and proseries express products 

fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003 professional tax segment operating income as a percentage of related revenue declined slightly on a 3 revenue increase in fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003 segment operating income did not grow in fiscal 2004 because of increased spending on product development and customer service 

other businesses 

fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004 other businesses segment operating income as a percentage of related revenue increased in fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004 quicken revenue was higher while quicken cost of revenue was relatively flat primarily due to savings resulting from the outsourcing of our quickencom website higher revenue combined with relatively stable spending also produced better fiscal 2005 operating margins in canada 

fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003 other businesses segment operating income as a percentage of related revenue increased slightly in fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003 quicken revenue increased on relatively flat spending and we exited the unprofitable online brokerage business in the first quarter of fiscal 2004 partially offsetting the quicken improvements canadian operating income as a percentage of related revenue was down in fiscal 2004 due to lower revenue on relatively stable spending 

nonoperating income and expenses 

interest and other income 

 higher interest rates and slightly higher average invested balances resulted in an increase in interest income in fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004 interest income decreased in fiscal 2004 compared with 2003 due to lower interest rates and lower average invested balances that were a result of common stock repurchases under our stock repurchase programs and acquisitions total interest and other income for all 

33 periods presented included royalties from trademark license and distribution agreements that we entered into when we sold our quicken loans mortgage business in july 2002 see note 8 to the financial statements the decrease in net foreign exchange gains in fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004 and in fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003 resulted primarily from our conversion of a significant portion of our canadian intercompany balances to longterm investments in that subsidiary in the third quarter of fiscal 2004 this reduced our statement of operations exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 

income taxes 

our effective tax rate was 326 for fiscal 2005 284 for fiscal 2004 and 329 for fiscal 2003 our effective tax rate for fiscal 2005 differed from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the net effect of the reversal of 257 million in reserves related to potential income tax exposures that were resolved the federal research and experimental credit and to the benefit received from taxexempt interest income offset by state taxes our effective tax rate for fiscal 2004 differed from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the net effect of the reversal of 357 million in reserves related to potential income tax exposures that were resolved the federal research and experimental credit and to the benefit received from taxexempt interest income offset by state taxes and acquisitionrelated charges our effective tax rate for fiscal 2003 differed from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the net effect of the benefit received from taxexempt interest income and various tax credits offset by state taxes and acquisitionrelated charges see note 12 to the financial statements 

at july 31 2005 we had net deferred tax assets of 1733 million which included a valuation allowance of 60 million for certain state capital loss carryforwards we decreased the valuation allowance by 15 million in fiscal 2005 due to the realization of state capital loss carryforwards that were previously estimated to be unrealizable and adjustments made to foreign net operating loss carryforwards the allowance reflects management’s assessment that we may not receive the benefit of certain loss carryforwards in certain state jurisdictions while we believe our current valuation allowance is sufficient it may be necessary to increase this amount if it becomes more likely that we will not realize a greater portion of the net deferred tax assets we assess the need for an adjustment to the valuation allowance on a quarterly basis see note 12 to the financial statements 

discontinued operations 

intuit information technology solutions 

in may 2005 our board of directors formally approved a plan to sell our intuit information technology solutions its business in accordance with the provisions of sfas 144 we determined that its became a longlived asset held for sale and a discontinued operation in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 consequently we have segregated the operating results of its from continuing operations on our statement of operations for all periods presented since the carrying value of its at july 31 2005 was less than the estimated fair value less cost to sell no adjustment to the carrying value of this longlived asset was necessary during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 see note 8 to the financial statements 

intuit public sector solutions 

in december 2004 we sold our intuit public sector solutions ipss business for approximately 11 million and accounted for the sale as a discontinued operation in accordance with sfas 144 we have segregated the operating results of ipss from continuing operations on our statement of operations for all periods prior to the sale in fiscal 2005 we recorded a loss on disposal of ipss of 48 million that included an income tax provision of 43 million for the estimated tax payable in connection with the tax gain on the transaction the fiscal 2004 net loss from intuit public sector solutions discontinued operations included a goodwill impairment charge of 187 million see note 8 to the financial statements 

34 intuit kk 

in february 2003 we sold our wholly owned japanese subsidiary intuit kk and accounted for the sale as a discontinued operation in accordance with sfas 144 we have segregated the operating results of intuit kk from continuing operations on our statement of operations for all periods prior to the sale in fiscal 2003 we recorded a gain on disposal of this discontinued operation of 710 million net of income taxes of 51 million see note 8 to the financial statements 

liquidity and capital resources 

statements of cash flows 

at july 31 2005 our cash cash equivalents and investments totaled 9943 million a decrease of 237 million from july 31 2004 in fiscal 2005 we generated cash primarily from continuing operations and by issuing common stock under employee stock plans we used cash in fiscal 2005 primarily for repurchases of common stock under our stock repurchase programs and capital expenditures the following table summarizes selected items from our statements of cash flows for fiscal 2005 2004 and 2003 see the financial statements in item 8 for complete statements of cash flows for those periods 

 we generated cash from our operating activities during fiscal 2005 2004 and 2003 primarily from net income from continuing operations in each of those years 

we used cash for investing activities during fiscal 2005 2004 and 2003 our primary use of cash for investing activities in fiscal 2004 was for business acquisitions our primary use of cash for investing activities in fiscal 2003 was for net purchases of availableforsale debt securities 

we used cash for financing activities in fiscal 2005 2004 and 2003 primarily for the repurchase of common stock under our stock repurchase programs see “stock repurchase programs” below and note 13 to the financial statements this was partially offset by proceeds that we received from the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans in each of these fiscal years 

cash generated by discontinued operations in fiscal 2003 included collection of 2456 million in amounts due from the purchaser of our quicken loans business and a net gain of 710 million from the sale of intuit kk see note 8 to the financial statements 

35 stock repurchase programs 

intuit’s board of directors has initiated a series of common stock repurchase programs shares of common stock repurchased under these programs become treasury shares the following table summarizes the historical activity under our stock repurchase programs as of july 31 2005 

 in may 2005 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 5000 million of our common stock from time to time over a threeyear period under repurchase plan v which expires on may 15 2008 at july 31 2005 authorized funds of approximately 2908 million remained under repurchase plan v we expect to continue to repurchase shares under this plan in fiscal 2006 

loans to executive officers and other employees 

outstanding loans to executive officers and other employees totaled 92 million at july 31 2005 and 171 million at july 31 2004 loans to executive officers and other employees at july 31 2005 excluded a 55 million secured loan to one executive officer who ceased to be an intuit employee in the third quarter of fiscal 2005 we transferred this loan to other longterm assets on our balance sheet in that quarter loans to executive officers are primarily relocation loans that are generally secured by real property and have original maturity dates of up to 10 years at july 31 2005 no loans were in default and all interest payments were current in accordance with the terms of the loan agreements consistent with the requirements of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 no loans to executive officers have been made or modified since july 30 2002 and we do not intend to make or modify loans to executive officers in the future see note 17 to the financial statements 

repurchases of vested restricted stock 

in the third quarters of fiscal 2005 2004 and 2003 we entered into share repurchase agreements with stephen m bennett our chief executive officer pursuant to which we repurchased shares of our common stock from mr bennett at the closing price quoted on the nasdaq stock market on the dates of repurchase we repurchased 15945 shares of our common stock at 4181 per share from mr bennett in fiscal 2005 17157 shares at 4464 per share in fiscal 2004 and 17532 shares at 3902 in fiscal 2003 all of the proceeds from these repurchases were remitted to federal and state taxing authorities to satisfy mr bennett’s federal state and medicare tax withholding obligations resulting from the vesting of 37500 shares of our common stock in each of those three quarters under his january 2000 newhire restricted stock awards these repurchases were approved by our board of directors 

other 

we evaluate on an ongoing basis the merits of acquiring technology or businesses or establishing strategic relationships with and investing in other companies we may decide to use cash and cash equivalents to fund such activities in the future 

we believe that our cash cash equivalents and investments will be sufficient to meet anticipated seasonal working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months 

36 offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of july 31 2005 we did not have any significant offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of regulations sk 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our known contractual obligations to make future payments at july 31 2005 

 

 recent accounting pronouncements 

sfas 123r “sharebased payment” 

on december 16 2004 the fasb issued sfas 123 revised 2004 “sharebased payment” sfas 123r which is a revision of sfas 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” sfas 123r supercedes apb 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” and amends sfas 95 “statement of cash flows” generally the approach in sfas 123r is similar to the approach described in sfas 123 however sfas 123r requires all sharebased payments to employees including grants of employee stock options and purchases under employee stock purchase plans to be recognized in the statement of operations based on their fair values pro forma disclosure of fair value recognition will no longer be an alternative 

sfas 123r is effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after june 15 2005 with earlier adoption permitted we are required to adopt this new standard in the first quarter of our fiscal year ending july 31 2006 sfas 123r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods 

 we have not yet chosen a method of adoption for sfas 123r 

as permitted by sfas 123 through the end of fiscal 2005 we accounted for sharebased payments to employees using apb 25’s intrinsic value method as a consequence we generally recognized no compensation cost for employee stock options and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan 

37 although the adoption of sfas 123r’s fair value method will have no adverse impact on our balance sheet or net cash flows it will have a significant adverse impact on our net income and net income per share the pro forma effects on net income and earnings per share if we had applied the fair value recognition provisions of sfas 123 to sharebased payments to employees in prior periods are disclosed in note 1 under “stockbased incentive programs” although the pro forma effects of applying sfas 123 may be indicative of the effects of applying sfas 123r the provisions of these two statements differ in some important respects the actual effects of adopting sfas 123r will depend on numerous factors including the valuation model we use to value future sharebased payments to employees estimated forfeiture rates and the accounting policies we adopt concerning the method of recognizing the fair value of awards over the requisite service period we currently estimate that the fiscal 2006 impact on intuit of adopting sfas 123r will be a decrease in net income of approximately 45 million 

sfas 123r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow rather than as an operating cash flow as prescribed under current accounting rules this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption total cash flow will remain unchanged compared with cash flow as it would have been reported under prior accounting rules 

sfas 154 “accounting changes and error corrections” 

on june 1 2005 the fasb issued sfas 154 “accounting changes and error corrections” which replaces apb 20 “accounting changes” and sfas 3 “reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements” sfas 154 applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle and changes the requirements for accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle sfas 154 requires retrospective application to prior periods’ financial statements of a voluntary change in accounting principle unless it is impracticable apb 20 previously required that most voluntary changes in accounting principle be recognized by including in net income of the period of the change the cumulative effect of changing to the new accounting principle sfas 154 carries forward many other provisions of apb 20 without change including the provisions related to the reporting of a change in accounting estimate a change in the reporting entity and the correction of an error sfas 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december 15 2005 earlier application is permitted for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after june 1 2005 we do not expect our adoption of this new standard to have a material impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

38 risks that could affect future results 

in evaluating intuit and our business you should consider the following factors in addition to the other information in this annual report on form 10k forwardlooking statements in this report are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results expressed or implied in the forwardlooking statements any of the following risks could seriously harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

we face intense competitive pressures in all of our businesses that may negatively impact our revenue profitability and market position 

we have formidable competitors and we expect competition to remain intense during fiscal 2006 and beyond the number resources and sophistication of the companies with whom we compete has increased as we continue to expand our product and service offerings microsoft corporation in particular presents a significant threat to a number of our businesses due to its market position strategic focus and superior financial resources our competitors may introduce new and improved products and services bundle new offerings with marketleading products reduce prices gain better access to distribution channels advertise aggressively or beat us to market with new products and services any of these competitive actions taken over any prolonged period could diminish our revenue and profitability and could affect our ability to keep existing customers and acquire new customers some additional competitive factors that may impact our businesses are discussed below 

quickbooksrelated losing existing or potential quickbooks customers to competitors causes us to lose potential software revenue and limits our opportunities to sell related products and services such as our financial supplies quickbooks payroll and merchant service offerings many competitors and potential competitors provide or have expressed significant interest in providing accounting and business management products and services to small businesses for example microsoft currently offers a number of competitive small business offerings and has indicated part of its growth strategy is to focus on small business offerings in november 2004 microsoft announced the impending launch of a number of product and service offerings aimed at small businesses including a product named microsoft office small business accounting which is expected to be integrated with the microsoft office product suite and available in the fall of 2005 microsoft also announced partnerships with adp and other service providers to offer payrollrelated services that interact with its products in july 2005 microsoft announced that it will collaborate with leading merchant acquiring institutions including chase merchant services llc to offer credit card processing for microsoft office small business accounting accordingly we expect that competition from microsoft in the small business area will intensify over time with the introduction of these and other offerings that directly compete with our quickbooks and other offerings although we have successfully competed with microsoft in the past given its market position and resources microsoft’s small business product and service offerings may have a significant negative impact on our revenue and profitability 

consumer tax our consumer tax business faces significant competition from both the public and private sector in the public sector we face the risk of federal and state taxing authorities developing or contracting to provide software or other systems to facilitate tax return preparation and electronic filing at no charge to taxpayers 

 39  other segments intuitbranded small business professional tax and other businesses our professional tax offerings face pricing pressure from competitors seeking to obtain our customers through deep product discounts and loss of customers to competitors offering nofrills offerings at low prices such as kleinrock publishing’s atx product line this business also faces competition from competitivelypriced tax and accounting solutions that include integration with nontax functionality the substantial size of our principal competitors in the outsourced payroll services business benefit from greater economies of scale that may result in pricing pressure for our offerings in addition in november 2004 microsoft announced that it had entered into partnership agreements with adp and other service providers to offer payrollrelated services that interact with its products the growth of electronic banking and other electronic payment systems is decreasing the demand for checks and consequently causing pricing pressure for our supplies products as competitors aggressively compete for share of this shrinking market our quicken products compete both with microsoft money which is aggressively promoted and priced and with webbased electronic banking and personal finance tracking and management tools that are becoming increasingly available at no cost to consumers these competitive pressures may result in reduced revenue and lower profitability for our quicken product line and related bill payment service offering 

future revenue growth for our core products depends upon our introduction of new and enhanced products and services 

our customerdriven invention and associated product development efforts are critical to our success the introduction of new offerings and product and service enhancements are necessary for us to differentiate 

40 our offerings from those of our competitors and to motivate our existing customers to purchase upgrades or current year products in the case of our tax offerings a number of our businesses derive a significant amount of their revenue through onetime upfront license fees and rely on customer upgrades and service offerings that include upgrades to generate a significant portion of their revenues as our existing products mature encouraging customers to purchase product upgrades becomes more challenging unless new product releases provide features and functionality that have meaningful incremental value if we are not able to develop and clearly demonstrate the value of upgraded products to our customers our upgrade and service revenues will be negatively impacted similarly our business will be harmed if we are not successful in our efforts to develop and introduce new products and services to retain our existing customers expand our customer base and increase revenues per customer 

our new product and service offerings may not achieve market success or may cannibalize sales of our existing products causing our revenues and earnings to decrease 

our future success depends in large part upon our ability to identify emerging opportunities in our target markets and our capacity to quickly develop and sell products and services that satisfy these demands in a cost effective manner successfully predicting demand trends is difficult and we may expend a significant amount of resources and management attention on products or services that do not ultimately succeed in their markets we have encountered difficulty in launching new products and services in the past for example in 2004 we discontinued our quickbooks premier healthcare offering due to lack of customer demand if we misjudge customer needs our new products and services will not succeed and our revenues and earnings will be negatively impacted in addition as we expand our offerings to new customer categories we run the risk of customers shifting from higher priced and higher margin products to newly introduced lower priced offerings for instance our new quickbooks simple start offering our new snap tax offering and our new proseries basic and proseries express offerings may attract users that would otherwise have purchased our higher priced more full featured offerings 

the nature of our products necessitates timely product launches and if we experience significant product quality problems or delays it will harm our revenues operating income and reputation 

all of our tax products and many of our nontax products have rigid development timetables that increase the risk of errors in our products and the risk of launch delays many of our products are highly complex and require interoperability with other software products and services our tax preparation software product development cycle is particularly challenging due to the need to incorporate unpredictable tax law and tax form changes each year and because our customers expect high levels of accuracy and a timely launch of these products to prepare and file their taxes by april 15th due to this complexity and the condensed development cycles under which we operate our products sometimes contain “bugs” that can unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the software for example our software may face interoperability difficulties with software operating systems or programs being used by our customers when we encounter problems we may be required to modify our code distribute patches to customers who have already purchased the product and recall or repackage existing product inventory in our distribution channels if we encounter development challenges or discover errors in our products late in our development cycle it may cause us to delay our product launch date any major defects or launch delays could lead to the following 

 41 the growth of our business depends on our ability to adapt to rapid technological change 

the software industry in which we operate is characterized by rapidly changing technology evolving industry standards and frequent new product introductions and enhancements our right for me marketing approach increases the importance for us of developing additional versions of our products to meet specific customer needs our ability to succeed in this rapidly changing environment requires that we continuously invest resources to enhance our software architecture and developer tools we must make this investment in order to continue to enhance our current products and develop new products to meet changing customer needs and to attract and retain talented software developers we are currently in the process of modernizing the software platforms for a number of our product lines including our quickbooks turbotax quicken and idms products completing these upgrades and adapting to other technological developments may require considerable time and expense if we experience prolonged delays or unforeseen difficulties in upgrading our software architecture our ability to develop new products and enhancements to our current products would suffer 

if we fail to maintain reliable and responsive service levels for our electronic tax offerings or if the irs or other governmental agencies experience difficulties in receiving customer submissions we could lose revenue and customers 

our webbased tax preparation services electronic filing services and “payasyougo” services are an important and growing part of our tax businesses and must effectively handle extremely heavy customer demand during the peak tax season from january to april we face significant risks and challenges in maintaining these services and maintaining adequate service levels particularly during peak volume service times similarly governmental entities receiving electronic tax filings must also handle large volumes of data and may experience difficulties with their systems preventing the receipt of electronic filings if customers are unable to file their returns electronically they may elect to make paper filings this would result in reduced electronic tax return preparation and filing revenues and profits and would negatively impact our reputation and ability to keep and attract customers who demand a reliable electronic filing experience we have experienced relatively brief unscheduled interruptions in our electronic filing andor tax preparation services during past tax years for example on april 15 2003 we experienced a relatively brief unscheduled interruption in our electronic filing service during which certain users of our professional tax products were unable to receive confirmation from us that their electronic filing had been accepted and on april 15 2002 we reached maximum capacity for processing efilings for a short period of time if we experience any prolonged difficulties with our webbased tax preparation or electronic filing service at any time during the tax season we could lose current and future customers receive negative publicity and incur increased operating costs any of which could have a significant negative impact on the financial and market success of these businesses and have a negative impact on our nearterm and longterm financial results 

if actual product returns exceed returns reserves or if actual customer rebate redemptions exceed rebate reserves our revenue would be lower 

we ship more desktop software products to our distributors and retailers than we expect them to sell in order to reduce the risk that distributors or retailers will run out of products this is particularly true for our consumer tax products which have a short selling season and for which returns occur primarily in our fiscal third and fourth quarters like many software companies that sell their products through distributors and retailers we have historically accepted significant product returns we establish reserves against revenue for product returns in our financial statements based on estimated future returns of products we closely monitor levels of product sales and inventory in the retail channel in an effort to maintain reserves that are adequate to cover expected returns in the past returns have not generally exceeded these reserves however if we do experience actual returns that significantly exceed reserves it would result in lower net revenue for example if we had increased our fiscal 2005 returns reserves by 1 of nonconsignment sales to retailers for quickbooks turbotax and quicken our fiscal 2005 total net revenue would have been approximately 36 million lower in addition our policy of recognizing revenue from distributors and retailers upon delivery of product for nonconsignment sales is predicated upon our 

42 ability to reasonably estimate returns if we do not continue to demonstrate our ability to estimate returns then our revenue recognition policy for these types of sales may no longer be appropriate we also offer customer rebates as part of our selling efforts and establish reserves through a charge to revenue for estimated future payments of rebates historically a percentage of customers do not submit requests for their rebates rebate redemption rates are going up because we along with certain retailers are making it easier for customers to claim rebates while we have taken this trend into account in determining our rebate reserves if a greater number of eligible customers seek rebates than for which we have provided reserves our margins will be adversely affected if rebate redemptions for our quickbooks turbotax and quicken products were to increase by 1 our annual total net revenue would decrease by approximately 12 million 

we are continuing to enhance our new information systems which we use to manage our business and finance operations and problems with the design or implementation of these enhancements could interfere with our business and operations 

in september 2004 we implemented new information systems that manage our business and finance operations during the course of the conversion we upgraded significant financial systems ordertaking systems middleware systems systems that allow for interoperability of different databases and network security systems while we were able to complete the processing requirements of our peak business season in fiscal 2005 we experienced some systemrelated slowdowns consequently we believe that we need to further enhance and upgrade the systems over the next several months to improve performance and support our future growth in the event that we are unable to expand the capabilities of our systems our ability to grow our business will be limited the expenditures associated with the expansion and upgrade of our systems could be significant problems with the design or implementation of these system enhancements could adversely impact our ability to do the following in a timely and accurate manner take customer orders ship products provide services and support to our customers bill and track our customers fulfill contractual obligations and otherwise run our business 

our revenue and earnings are highly seasonal and our quarterly results fluctuate significantly 

several of our businesses are highly seasonal causing significant quarterly fluctuations in our financial results revenue and operating results are usually strongest during the second and third fiscal quarters ending january 31 and april 30 due to our tax businesses contributing most of their revenue during those quarters and the timing of the release of our small business software upgrades we experience lower revenues and significant operating losses in the first and fourth quarters ending october 31 and july 31 for example in the second and third quarters of our last two fiscal years we had total net revenue of between 6206 million and 8349 million while in our first and fourth fiscal quarters we had total net revenue of between 2271 million and 3018 million our financial results can also fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year due to a variety of factors including changes in product sales mix that affect average selling prices product release dates the timing of our discontinuance of support for older product offerings the timing of sales of our higherpriced intuitbranded small business offerings our methods for distributing our products including the shift to a consignment model for some of our desktop products sold through retail distribution channels the inclusion of upgrades with certain offerings which can impact the pattern of revenue recognition and the timing of acquisitions divestitures and goodwill and purchased intangible asset impairment charges 

as our product and service offerings become more complex our revenue streams may become less predictable 

our expanding range of products and services generates more varied revenue streams than our traditional desktop software businesses the accounting policies that apply to these revenue streams are more complex than those that apply to our traditional products and services we expect this trend to continue as we acquire additional companies and expand our offerings for example as we begin to offer additional features and options as part of multipleelement revenue arrangements we could be required to defer a higher percentage of our product revenue at the time of sale than we do for traditional products this would decrease recognized revenue at the time products are shipped but result in increased recognized 

43 revenue in fiscal periods after shipment in addition our intuitbranded small business segment businesses offer products and services with significantly higher prices than our traditional core business software products revenue from these offerings tends to be less predictable than revenue from our traditional desktop products due to longer sales and implementation cycles which could cause our quarterly revenue from these businesses to fluctuate 

acquisitionrelated costs and impairment charges can cause significant fluctuation in our net income 

our acquisitions have resulted in significant expenses including amortization of purchased assets which is reflected in cost of revenue as well as charges for inprocess research and development impairment of goodwill amortization and impairment of purchased intangible assets and charges for deferred compensation which are reflected in operating expenses total acquisitionrelated costs in the categories identified above were 268 million in fiscal 2005 336 million in fiscal 2004 and 451 million in fiscal 2003 although under current accounting rules goodwill is no longer amortized we may incur impairment charges related to the goodwill already recorded and to goodwill arising out of future acquisitions we test the impairment of goodwill annually in our fourth fiscal quarter or more frequently if indicators of impairment arise the timing of the formal annual test may result in charges to our statement of operations in our fourth fiscal quarter that could not have been reasonably foreseen in prior periods for example at the end of fiscal 2004 we incurred a goodwill impairment charge of 187 million related to our intuit public sector solutions business as of july 31 2005 we had goodwill of 5095 million and unamortized purchased intangible assets of 697 million on our balance sheet both of which could be subject to impairment charges in the future new acquisitions and any impairment of the value of purchased assets could have a significant negative impact on our future operating results 

if we do not respond promptly and effectively to customer service and technical support inquiries we will lose customers and our revenues will decline 

the effectiveness of our customer service and technical support operations are critical to customer satisfaction and our financial success if we do not respond effectively to service and technical support requests we will lose customers and miss revenue opportunities such as paid service product renewals and new product sales in our service offerings such as our merchant card processing and outsourced payroll businesses customer service delivery is fundamental to retaining and maintaining existing customers and acquiring new customers we occasionally experience customer service and technical support problems including longer than expected waiting times for customers when our staffing and systems are inadequate to handle a higherthananticipated volume of requests we also risk losing service at any one of our customer contact centers and our redundancy systems could prove inadequate to provide backup support training and retaining qualified customer service and technical support personnel is particularly challenging due to the expansion of our product offerings and the seasonality of our tax business for example in fiscal 2005 the number of our consumer tax service representatives ranged from 15 during offseason months to about 715 at the peak of the season if we do not adequately train our support representatives our customers will not receive the level of support that they demand and we strive to deliver to improve our performance in this area we must eliminate underlying causes of service and support requests through product improvements better order fulfillment processes more robust selfhelp tools and improved ability to accurately anticipate demand for support implementing any of these improvements can be expensive time consuming and ultimately prove unsuccessful if we do not deliver the high level of support that our customers expect for any of the reasons stated above we will lose customers and our financial results will suffer 

if we encounter problems with our thirdparty customer service and technical support providers our business will be harmed and our margins will decline 

we outsource a substantial portion of our customer service and technical support activities to domestic and international thirdparty service providers including to service providers in india during fiscal 2004 we greatly increased the number of thirdparty customer service representatives working on our behalf and we 

44 expect to continue to rely heavily on third parties in the future this strategy provides us with lower operating costs and greater flexibility but also presents risks to our business including the following 

 we depend upon a small number of larger retailers to generate a significant portion of our sales volume for our desktop software products 

we sell most of our desktop software products through our retail distribution channel and a relatively small number of larger retailers generate a significant portion of our sales volume our principal retailers have significant bargaining leverage due to their size and available resources any change in principal business terms termination or major disruption of our relationship with these resellers could result in a potentially significant decline in our revenues and earnings for example the sourcing decisions product display locations and promotional activities that retailers undertake can greatly impact the sales of our products due to its seasonal nature sales of turbotax are particularly impacted by such decisions and if our principal distribution sources were to elect to carry or promote competitive products our revenues would decline the fact that we also sell our products directly could cause retailers to reduce their efforts to promote our products or stop selling our products altogether if any of our retailers run into financial difficulties we may be unable to collect amounts that we are owed 

selling new products may be more challenging and costlier than selling our historical products causing our margins to decline 

because our strategy for some of our products involves the routine introduction of new products at retail if retailers do not offer our new products we will not be able to grow as planned an outcome of our right for me marketing approach is the introduction of additional versions of our products retailers may be reluctant to stock unproven products or products that sell at higher prices but more slowly retailers may also choose to place less emphasis on software as a category within their stores in addition it may be costlier for us to market and sell some of our higher priced products due to our need to convey the more customerspecific value of the products to customers rather than communicating more generalized benefits this may require us to develop other marketing programs that supplement our traditional instore promotional efforts to sell these products to customers causing our margins to shrink if retail distribution proves an ineffective channel for certain of our new offerings it could adversely impact our growth revenue and profitability 

if our manufacturing and distribution suppliers execute poorly our business will be harmed 

we have chosen to outsource the manufacturing and distribution of many of our desktop software products to a small number of third party providers and we use a single vendor to produce and distribute our check and business forms supplies products although our reliance on a small number of suppliers or a single supplier provides us with efficiencies and enhanced bargaining power poor performance by or lack of effective communication with these parties can significantly harm our business this risk is amplified by 

45 the fact that we carry very little inventory and rely on justintime manufacturing processes we mitigate this risk by managing our second tier vendors and maintaining contingency plans we have experienced problems with our suppliers in the past for example during fiscal 2004 one of our suppliers was unable to fulfill orders for some of our software products for a number of days due to operational difficulties and communication errors although together we were able to mitigate the impact of that delay with minimal disruption to our business if we experience longer delays delays during a peak demand period or significant quality issues our business could be significantly harmed 

failure to maintain the availability and security of the systems networks databases and software required to operate and deliver our internetbased products and services could adversely affect our operating results 

our internetbased product and service offerings including quickbooks online edition quickbooks assisted payroll service complete webbased payroll turbo tax for the web consumer and professional electronic tax filing services quickencom and quickbase rely on a variety of systems networks and databases many of which are maintained by us at our data centers in order to prevent interruptions to the availability of our internetbased products and services we generally follow industrystandard practices for creating a faulttolerant environment however we do not have complete redundancy for all of our systems we maintain backup processing capabilities that are designed to protect us against siterelated disasters for many of our missioncritical applications notwithstanding our efforts to protect against “down time” for our internetbased products and services we do occasionally experience unplanned outages or technical difficulties in order to provide our internetbased products and services we must protect the security of our systems networks databases and software like all companies that deliver products and services via the internet we are subject to attack by computer hackers who develop and deploy software that is designed to penetrate the security of our systems and networks a hacker who is able to penetrate our security systems could misappropriate or damage our proprietary information or cause disruptions in the delivery of our products and services we believe that we have taken steps to protect against such attacks however there can be no assurance that our security measures will not be penetrated by experienced hackers in the event that the systems networks databases and software required to deliver our internetbased products and services become unavailable or suffer technical difficulties or a breach in security we may be required to expend significant resources to alleviate these problems and our operating results could suffer in addition any such interruption or breach of security could damage our reputation and lead to the loss of customers 

failure of our information technology systems or those of our service providers could adversely affect our future operating results 

we rely on a variety of internal technology systems and technology systems maintained by our outside manufacturing and distribution suppliers to take and fulfill customer orders handle customer service requests host our webbased activities support internal operations and store customer and company data these systems could be damaged or interrupted preventing us or our service providers from accepting and fulfilling customer orders or otherwise interrupting our business in addition these systems could suffer security breaches causing company and customer data to be unintentionally disclosed any of these occurrences could adversely impact our operations we have experienced system challenges in the past for example during fiscal 2004 some of our noncritical systems were interrupted due to computer viruses that caused loss of productivity and added expense we also experience computer server failures from time to time to prevent interruptions we must continually upgrade our systems and processes to ensure that we have adequate recoverability – both of which are costly and time consuming while we and our outside service partners have backup systems for certain aspects of our operations not all systems upon which we rely are fully redundant and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities 

possession and use of personal customer information by our businesses presents risks and expenses that could harm our business 

a number of our businesses possess personal customer information including credit card numbers we use commercially available encryption technology to transmit customer information when orders are placed over the internet however there can be no assurance that a third party will not be able to circumvent 

46 these security measures possession and use of personal customer information in conducting our business subjects us to regulatory burdens and potential lawsuits we have incurred — and will continue to incur — significant expenses to comply with mandatory privacy and security standards and protocols and there is a trend toward greater regulation of privacy for example regulations like the recently created federal “do not call list” and actions by internet service providers to limit communications with their subscribers may impede our ability to communicate with our customers and increase our compliance costs because our businesses rely heavily on direct marketing any limitations on our ability to communicate with our customers could harm our financial results in the past we have experienced lawsuits and negative publicity relating to privacy issues and we could face similar suits in the future a major breach of customer privacy or security by intuit or even another company could have serious negative consequences for our businesses including direct damages that we may be required to pay as a result of a breach by us reduced customer demand for our services damage to our reputation and additional regulation by federal or state agencies although we have sophisticated network security internal control measures and physical security procedures to safeguard customer information there can be no assurance that a data security breach or theft will not occur resulting in harm to our business and results of operations 

we are exposed to risks associated with credit card fraud and credit card processing and payment 

many of our customers use credit cards to pay for our services we have suffered losses and may continue to suffer losses as a result of orders placed with fraudulent credit card data under current credit card practices we may be liable for fraudulent credit card transactions if we do not obtain a cardholder’s signature a frequent practice in internet sales we employ technology solutions to help us detect fraudulent credit card transactions however the failure to detect or control credit card fraud could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights competitors may exploit our innovations which could weaken our competitive position and reduce our revenues 

our success depends upon our proprietary technology we rely on a combination of copyright trade secret trademark patent confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights as part of our confidentiality procedures we generally enter into nondisclosure agreements with our employees contractors distributors and corporate partners and into license agreements with respect to our software documentation and other proprietary information effectively creating and protecting our proprietary rights is expensive and may require us to engage in costly and distracting litigation despite these precautions third parties could copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology without authorization because we outsource significant aspects of our product development manufacturing and distribution we are at risk that confidential portions of our intellectual property could become public by lapses in security by our contractors we have licensed in the past and expect to license in the future certain of our proprietary rights such as trademarks or copyrighted material to others these licensees may take actions that diminish the value of our proprietary rights or harm our reputation it is also possible that other companies could successfully challenge the validity or scope of our patents and that our patent portfolio which is relatively small may not provide us with a meaningful competitive advantage ultimately our attempts to secure legal protection for our proprietary rights may not be adequate and our competitors could independently develop similar technologies duplicate our products or design around patents and other intellectual property rights if our intellectual property protection proves inadequate we could lose our competitive advantage and our financial results will suffer 

we expect copying and misuse of our intellectual property to be a persistent problem causing lost revenue and increased expenses 

our intellectual property rights are among our most valuable assets policing unauthorized use and copying of our products is difficult expensive and time consuming current us laws that prohibit copying give us only limited practical protection from software piracy and the laws of many other countries provide very little protection we may not be able to prevent misappropriation of our technology for example we frequently encounter unauthorized copies of our software being sold through online auction sites and other 

47 online marketplaces in addition efforts to protect our intellectual property may be misunderstood and perceived negatively by our customers for example during 2003 we employed technology to prohibit unauthorized sharing of our turbotax products these efforts were not effectively communicated causing a negative reaction by some of our customers who misunderstood our actions although we continue to evaluate technology solutions to piracy and we continue to increase our civil and criminal enforcement efforts we expect piracy to be a persistent problem that results in lost revenues and increased expenses 

although we are unable to quantify the extent of piracy of our software products software piracy may depress our net revenues we engage in efforts to educate consumers on the benefits of licensing genuine products and to educate lawmakers on the advantages of a business climate where intellectual property rights are protected and we cooperate with the software  information industry association in their efforts to combat piracy however these efforts may not affect the piracy of our products 

we do not own all of the software other technologies and content used in our products and services 

many of our products are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties we believe we have all of the necessary licenses from third parties to use and distribute third party technology and content that we do not own that is used in our current products and services from time to time we may be required to renegotiate with these third parties – or negotiate with new third parties – to include their technology or content in our existing products in new versions of our existing products or in wholly new products we may not be able to negotiate or renegotiate licenses on reasonable terms or at all if we are unable to obtain the rights necessary to use or continue to use thirdparty technology or content in our products and services we may not be able to sell the affected products which would in turn have a negative impact on our revenue and operating results 

third parties claiming that we infringe their proprietary rights could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and prevent us from selling our products 

from time to time we have received claims that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of others as the number of products in the software industry increases and the functionality of these products further overlap and as we acquire technology through acquisitions or licenses we believe that we may become increasingly subject to infringement claims including patent copyright and trademark infringement claims we expect that software products in general will increasingly be subject to these claims as the number of products and competitors increase the functionality of products overlap and as the patenting of software functionality continues to grow we have from time to time received allegations of patent infringement claims in the past and may receive more claims in the future based on allegations that our products infringe upon patents held by third parties the receipt of a notice alleging infringement may require us to obtain a costly opinion of counsel to prevent an allegation of intentional infringement future claims could present an exposure of uncertain magnitude we believe that we would be able to obtain any necessary licenses or other rights to disputed intellectual property rights on commercially reasonable terms however the ultimate outcome of any allegation is uncertain and regardless of outcome any such claim with or without merit could be time consuming to defend result in costly litigation divert management’s time and attention from our business require us to stop selling to delay shipping or to redesign our products or require us to pay monetary damages for royalty or licensing arrangements or to satisfy indemnification obligations that we have with some of our customers our failure to obtain necessary license or other rights or litigation arising out of intellectual property claims could adversely affect our business 

in addition we license and use software from third parties in our business these third party software licenses may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms also these third parties may from time to time receive claims that they have infringed the intellectual property rights of others including patent and copyright infringement claims which may affect our ability to continue licensing their software our inability to use any of this third party software could result in shipment delays or other disruptions in our business which could materially and adversely affect our operating results 

48 our acquisition activity could disrupt our ongoing business and may present risks not contemplated at the time of the transactions 

we have acquired and may continue to acquire companies products and technologies that complement our strategic direction these acquisitions may involve significant risks and uncertainties including 

 acquisitions are inherently risky we can not be certain that our previous or future acquisitions will be successful and will not materially adversely affect the conduct operating results or financial condition of our business we have generally paid cash for our recent acquisitions if we issue common stock or other equity related purchase rights as consideration in an acquisition current shareholders’ percentage ownership and earnings per share may become diluted 

if we fail to operate our outsourced payroll business effectively our revenue and profitability will be harmed 

our payroll business handles a significant amount of dollar and transaction volume due to the size and volume of transactions that we handle effective processing systems and controls are essential to ensure that transactions are handled appropriately despite our efforts it is possible that we may make errors or that funds may be misappropriated in addition to any direct damages and fines that any such problems would create which could be substantial the loss of customer confidence in our accuracy and controls would seriously harm our business our payroll business has grown largely through acquisitions and our systems are comprised of multiple technology platforms that are difficult to scale we must constantly continue to upgrade our systems and processes to ensure that we process customer data in an accurate reliable and timely manner these upgrades must also meet the various regulatory requirements and deadlines associated with employerrelated payroll activities any failure of our systems or processes in critical switchover times such as in january when many businesses elect to change payroll service providers would be detrimental to our business if we failed to timely deliver any of our payroll products it could cause our current and prospective customers to choose a competitor’s product for that year’s payroll and not to purchase intuit products in the future to generate sustained growth in our payroll business we must successfully develop and manage a more proactive inside and field sales operation if these efforts are not successful our revenue growth and profitability will decline 

interest income attributable to payroll customer deposits may fluctuate or be eliminated causing our revenue and profitability to decline 

we currently record revenue from interest earned on customer deposits that we hold pending payment of funds to taxing authorities or to customers’ employees if interest rates decline or there are regulatory changes that diminish the amount of time that we are required or permitted to hold such funds our interest revenue will decline 

we face a number of risks in our merchant card processing business that could result in a reduction in our revenues and profits 

our merchant card processing service business is subject to the following risks 

 49  should any of these risks be realized our business could be harmed and our financial results will suffer 

increased state tax filing mandates such as the required use of specific technologies could significantly increase our costs 

we are required to comply with a variety of state revenue agency standards in order to successfully operate our tax preparation and electronic filing services changes in stateimposed requirements by one or more of the states including the required use of specific technologies or technology standards could significantly increase the costs of providing those services to our customers and could prevent us from delivering a quality product to our customers in a timely manner 

we may be unable to attract and retain key personnel 

much of our future success depends on the continued service and availability of skilled personnel including members of our executive team and those in technical marketing and staff positions experienced personnel in the software and services industries are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense especially in silicon valley and san diego california where the majority of our employees are located although we strive to be an employer of choice we may not be able to continue to successfully attract and retain key personnel which would cause our business to suffer 

our insurance policies are costly may be inadequate and potentially expose us to unrecoverable risks 

insurance availability coverage terms and pricing continue to vary with market conditions we endeavor to obtain appropriate insurance coverage for insurable risks that we identify however we may fail to correctly anticipate or quantify insurable risks we may not be able to obtain appropriate insurance coverage and insurers may not respond as we intend to cover insurable events that may occur we have observed rapidly changing conditions in the insurance markets relating to nearly all areas of traditional corporate insurance such conditions have resulted in higher premium costs higher policy deductibles and lower coverage limits for some risks because of cost or availability we do not have insurance coverage for these reasons we are retaining a greater portion of insurable risks than we have in the past at relatively greater cost 

required expensing of stock options will significantly reduce our net income and earnings per share 

although we were not previously required to record any compensation expense in connection with option grants to employees that have an exercise price at or above fair market value a change in generally accepted accounting principles requires us to treat all employee stock options as compensation expense beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 the increased compensation expense will significantly reduce our net income and earnings per share under generally accepted accounting principles see “recent accounting pronouncements” earlier in this item 7 

50 we are frequently a party to litigation that is costly to defend and consumes the time of our management 

due to our financial position and the large number of customers that we serve we are often forced to defend litigation for example we are currently being sued in an action for claims related to quicken brokerage powered by siebert a strategic alliance between the two companies although we believe that this case has no merit and we are defending the matter vigorously defending such matters consumes the time of our management and is expensive for intuit even though we often seek insurance coverage for litigation defense costs there is no assurance that our defense costs which can be substantial will be covered in all cases in addition by its nature litigation is unpredictable and we may not prevail even in cases where we strongly believe a plaintiff’s case has no valid claims if we do not prevail in litigation we may be required to pay substantial monetary damages or alter our business operations regardless of the outcome litigation is expensive and consumes the time of our management and may ultimately reduce our income 

unanticipated changes in our tax rates could affect our future results 

our future effective tax rates could be favorably or unfavorably affected by unanticipated changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or by changes in tax laws or their interpretation in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

our stock price may be volatile 

our stock has at times experienced substantial price volatility as a result of variations between our actual and anticipated financial results and as a result of our announcements and those of our competitors in addition the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies in ways that have been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies these factors as well as general economic and political conditions may materially adversely affect the market price of our stock in the future 

if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls we may not be able to detect fraud or report our financial results accurately which could harm our business and the trading price of our common stock 

effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and to detect and prevent fraud we periodically assess our system of internal controls and the internal controls of service providers upon which we rely to review their effectiveness and identify potential areas of improvement these assessments may conclude that enhancements modifications or changes to our system of internal controls are necessary in addition from time to time we acquire businesses many of which have limited infrastructure and systems of internal controls performing assessments of internal controls implementing necessary changes and maintaining an effective internal controls process is expensive and requires considerable management attention particularly in the case of newly acquired entities internal control systems are designed in part upon assumptions about the likelihood of future events and all such systems however well designed and operated can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance that the objectives of the system are met because of these and other inherent limitations of control systems there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions regardless of how remote if we fail to implement and maintain an effective system of internal controls or prevent fraud we could suffer losses could be subject to costly litigation investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information and our brand and operating results could be harmed which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock 

pursuant to section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act we and our independent registered public accounting firm must certify the adequacy of our internal controls over financial reporting annually identification of material weaknesses in internal controls over financial reporting by us or our independent registered public accounting firm could adversely affect our competitive position in our business especially our outsourced payroll business and the market price for our common stock 

51 business interruptions could adversely affect our future operating results 

several of our major business operations are subject to interruption by earthquake fire power shortages terrorist attacks and other hostile acts and other events beyond our control the majority of our research and development activities our corporate headquarters our principal information technology systems and other critical business operations are located near major seismic faults we do not carry earthquake insurance for direct quakerelated losses while we maintain disaster recovery facilities for most of our data centers that support the information systems networks and databases that are necessary to operate our business we are still in the process of establishing disaster recovery facilities for some of our data centers our operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake or other natural or manmade disaster

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

investment portfolio 

we do not hold derivative financial instruments in our portfolio of investments and funds held for payroll customers our investments and funds held for payroll customers consist of instruments that meet quality standards consistent with our investment policy this policy specifies that except for direct obligations of the united states government securities issued by agencies of the united states government and money market or cash management funds we diversify our holdings by limiting our investments and funds held for payroll customers with any individual issuer 

the following table presents our portfolio of cash equivalents and investments as of july 31 2005 by stated maturity the table is classified by the original maturity date listed on the security and includes cash equivalents and investments that are part of funds held for payroll customers on our balance sheet cash equivalents consist primarily of money market funds approximately 90 of our availableforsale debt securities have an interest reset date put date or mandatory call date within one year as of july 31 2005 the weighted average interest rate earned on our money market accounts was 319 and the weighted average interest rate earned on our investments was 305 

 interest rate risk 

our cash equivalents and our portfolio of investments and funds held for payroll customers are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates interest rate movements affect the interest income we earn on cash equivalents investments and funds held for payroll customers and the value of those investments should interest rates increase by 10 or about 30 basis points from the levels of july 31 2005 the value of our investments and funds held for payroll customers would decline by approximately 08 million should interest rates increase by 100 basis points from the levels of july 31 2005 the value of our investments and funds held for payroll customers would decline by approximately 26 million 

impact of foreign currency rate changes 

since we translate foreign currencies primarily canadian dollars and british pounds into us dollars for financial reporting purposes currency fluctuations can have an impact on our financial results the historical impact of currency fluctuations has generally been immaterial we believe that our exposure to currency exchange fluctuation risk is not significant primarily because our global subsidiaries invoice customers and satisfy their financial obligations almost exclusively in their local currencies due primarily to the effect of the weakening us dollar on intercompany balances with our canadian subsidiary we recorded foreign currency exchange gains of 51 million in fiscal 2003 and 27 million in fiscal 2004 in the third quarter of fiscal 2004 we converted a significant portion of our canadian intercompany balances to longterm investments in that subsidiary which reduced our statement of operations exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates we recorded a nominal foreign currency exchange loss in fiscal 2005 although the impact of currency fluctuations on our financial results has generally been immaterial in the past and we believe that for the reasons cited above currency fluctuations will not be significant in the future there can be no guarantee that the impact of currency fluctuations will not be material in the future as of july 31 2005 we did not engage in foreign currency hedging activities

australiabased reckon limited in addition we have a branding agreement for quickbooks in china and a distribution arrangement for quickbooks and quicken in south africa product development since the personal computer and software industries are characterized by rapid technological change shifting customer needs and frequent new product introductions and enhancements a continuous high level of investment is required for the enhancement of existing products and the development of new products we develop the majority of our products internally we may also supplement our internal development efforts by acquiring strategically important products and technology from third parties or establishing other relationships that enable us to expand our offerings more rapidly our core desktop software products quickbooks turbotax proseries lacerte and quicken tend to have fairly predictable structured development cycles of about a year with annual product releases these businesses also develop new products whose development cycles are less predictable developing consumer and professional tax software presents unique challenges because of the demanding development cycle required to accurately incorporate tax law and tax form changes within a rigid timetable the development timing for our outsourced payroll offerings is determined by business needs and regulatory requirements and the length of the development cycle depends on the scope and complexity of each particular project the product development cycles for the other businesses in our intuitbranded small business segment also vary and can be longer than one year for major product releases over the next few years we expect that we will be developing more versions of more complex products than ever before in addition we anticipate that these products will offer increased ease of use be customized for specific customer categories and feature improved integration with other intuit products and services and with our internal information systems our research and development efforts will be focused on developing new products and services to address customer needs in our more broadly defined markets as well as adding complementary products and services to drive additional recurring revenue from our core products our research and development expenses were 1985 million in fiscal 2002 2558 million in fiscal 2003 and 2811 million in fiscal 2004 and represented 15 of total net revenue in each of those periods seasonality our quickbooks consumer tax and professional tax businesses are highly seasonal some of our other offerings are seasonal but to a lesser extent revenue from upgrades for many of our small business software products tend to be concentrated around calendar year end sales of income tax preparation products and services are heavily concentrated in the period from november through april these seasonal patterns mean that our total net revenue is usually highest during our second quarter ending january 31 and third quarter ending april 30 we typically report losses in our first quarter ending october 31 and fourth quarter ending july 31 when revenue from our tax businesses is minimal while operating expenses to develop new products and services continue at relatively consistent levels marketing sales and distribution markets our primary target markets are small businesses with up to 20 employees professional accountants and individuals in addition we have acquired several companies that offer business management solutions to small and mediumsized businesses these include innovative merchant solutions intuit information technology solutions intuit distribution management solutions intuit real estate solutions intuit construction business solutions and intuit public sector solutions many of the markets in which we compete are characterized by rapidly shifting customer demands continuous technological change and frequent new product introductions by competitors market and industry changes can quickly render existing products and services obsolete so our success depends on our ability to respond rapidly to 8 

these changes with new business models updated competitive strategies new or enhanced products and services alternative distribution methods and other changes to the way we do business marketing programs we use a variety of marketing programs to generate software orders stimulate demand and generally maintain and increase customer awareness of our products these programs include mail email and telephone solicitations directresponse newspaper and magazine advertising and television and radio advertising we also use workflowintegrated inproduct messaging in several of our software products to market other related products and services including thirdparty products and services customers who respond to direct marketing campaigns and inproduct messaging purchase products and services from us by telephone or through our web sites distribution channels direct sales channel  we sell many of our products and services directly to our customers through our web sites call centers and direct sales force over the past three years we have introduced more sophisticated higherpriced software products and business management solutions these include broader outsourced payroll offerings and business solutions for information technology managers and businesses in selected industries as a result we have been enhancing our direct sales capabilities to support revenue growth in these areas retail distribution channel  we market our quickbooks turbotax and quicken desktop software at retail in north america primarily through office supply superstores warehouse clubs consumer electronics retailers food and drug retailers catalogers and general mass merchandisers in international markets we also rely on distributors valueadded resellers and other third parties who sell products into the retail channel we continue to benefit from strong relationships with a number of major north american retailers which allows us to minimize our dependence on any specific retailer we deliver products to larger retailers through a combination of direct to store deliveries and shipments to central warehouse locations we also ship products for many of our smaller retail customers through distributors see “manufacturing and distribution” we continue to aggressively manage our inventory to optimize instock presence and ensure good product placement within retail stores in response to current retail trends we are also placing a greater proportion of inventory with retailers on a consignment basis as we continue to execute on the right for me strategies in each of our businesses we are offering software products that are more complex and have higher prices than our traditional retail software products our recent tailoring of some of these software products to specific customer needs including industryspecific versions of quickbooks is also resulting in a greater number of intuit products we produce and place instore displays and other retail merchandising aids that educate customers about product functionality and benefits oem channel  we have relationships with a number of personal computer “original equipment manufacturers” or oems including apple computer inc dell inc and hewlettpackard although aggregate revenue from our oem channel is much less significant than revenue from our other distribution channels oem relationships help us to generate sales of our core desktop software products in two ways first certain oems “prebundle” newuser versions of certain desktop software products on the computer systems that the oems sell to their customers these prebundled oem sales are a good source of new customers and future revenues the second source of revenue from the oem channel is “aftermarket” programs in which customers who are purchasing computers can select and purchase software products at the same time thirdparty “valueadded” distribution arrangements  we supplement our direct sales capabilities and our retail and oem distribution relationships with selected thirdparty distribution arrangements we believe these relationships will enhance the growth opportunities for our higherend product and service offerings by allowing us to benefit from the valueadded marketing and sales expertise of these third parties we currently have arrangements with third parties who have specialized expertise in marketing selling and providing postsale implementation services for innovative merchant solutions and some of our intuitbranded small business solutions during fiscal 2005 and beyond we expect to continue to optimize and support our network of thirdparty relationships 9 

competition overview we face intense competition in all of our businesses both domestically and internationally competitive interest and expertise in many of the markets we serve particularly small business and consumer tax has grown markedly over the past few years and we expect this trend to continue some of our existing competitors have significantly greater financial technical and marketing resources than we do as we implement our customerdriven strategies we face increased competitive threats from larger companies in more diverse markets than we have historically faced in addition the competitive landscape can shift rapidly as new companies enter markets in which we compete consumer tax  we also face potential competitive challenges in our consumer tax business from publicly funded government entities that offer electronic tax preparation and filing services at no cost to individual taxpayers we are a member of the free file alliance a consortium of private sector companies that signed a threeyear agreement with the federal government in october 2002 under this agreement a number of private sector companies rather than the federal government are providing webbased federal tax preparation and filing services at no cost to disadvantaged and underserved federal taxpayers through voluntary public service initiatives such as our intuit tax freedom project unless the government or the consortium elect to terminate the agreement it will renew every two years in perpetuity after the october 2005 expiration of the initial threeyear term a number of states have adopted similar publicprivate agreements modeled after the free file alliance however many other states have taken the opposite approach and offer some form of directly sponsored tax preparation and filing services free to qualified taxpayers we continue to actively work with others in the private and public sectors to advance the goals of the free file alliance policy initiative and to support successful publicprivate partnership however future administrative regulatory or legislative activity in this area could adversely affect our consumer tax business quickbooks turbotax proseries lacerte and quicken desktop software  we believe the most important competitive factors for our desktop software products are product features ease of use size of the installed customer base brand name recognition price and product and support quality access to distribution channels is also important for our quickbooks turbotax and quicken products we believe we compete effectively on these factors as quickbooks turbotax and quicken products are the leading products in the retail sales channel for their respective categories products and services other than desktop software  we believe the most important competitive factors for products and services other than desktop software are features and ease of use brand name recognition speed in getting new products and services to market the ability to distribute them effectively and quality of implementation and support we believe we compete effectively on these factors for our service offerings such as outsourced payroll service reliability and scalability of operations are also important factors due to the size of our principal competitors in these service businesses we will need to scale our businesses to compete effectively over the long term significant competitive factors for our financial supplies business include ordering convenience product quality speed of delivery and price we believe that our convenient access to our large quickbooks and quicken customer bases is a significant competitive advantage for our financial supplies business 10 

competitors the following table shows the significant competitors for each of our major products and services  

customer service and technical support we provide customer service and technical support by telephone online chat fax email and our customer service and technical support web sites we have fulltime and outsourced customer service and technical support staffs which we supplement with seasonal employees and additional outsourcing during periods of peak call volumes such as during the tax return filing season or following a major product launch we outsource to several firms domestically and internationally most of our internationally outsourced customer service and technical support personnel are located in india 11

results of operations overview  

in fiscal 2004 we revised our reportable segments to reflect the way we currently manage our operations and view our results our five business segments are now quickbooksrelated intuitbranded small business consumer tax professional tax and other businesses total net revenue increased in fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003 primarily due to growth in our quickbooksrelated and consumer tax segments fiscal 2004 growth in our quickbooksrelated segment was driven by sales of higherpriced versions of quickbooks and by continuing growth in the quickbooks doityourself payroll or diy customer base and average selling prices which resulted in higher diy revenue total net revenue increased in fiscal 2003 compared with fiscal 2002 primarily due to growth in our quickbooksrelated and consumer tax segments with the quickbooksrelated revenue increase fueled by sales of higherpriced versions of quickbooks and by diy revenue fiscal 2003 revenue also increased compared with fiscal 2002 because of acquisitions in our intuitbranded small business segment the markets for many of our products are maturing and as a result we believe that our revenue growth is slowing we continue to develop new products and services to mitigate the impact of this slowing growth in the long term income from continuing operations grew faster than revenue in fiscal 2004 primarily due to an increase in revenue from highermargin products such as industryspecific versions of quickbooks and diy and to the fact that we reduced costs while revenue grew in our quicken business income from continuing operations grew faster than revenue in fiscal 2003 primarily due to an increase in revenue from highermargin products efficiencies in customer service and technical support significantly lower acquisitionrelated charges in fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2002 charges for vacant facilities impairment of goodwill and intangible assets and impairment of longlived assets that did not recur in fiscal 2003 fiscal 2003 acquisitionrelated charges were significantly lower compared with fiscal 2002 because due to our adoption of sfas 142 fiscal 2003 acquisitionrelated charges do not include amortization of goodwill net income after tax from continuing operations grew faster than revenue in fiscal 2004 primarily due to the factors cited above and the reversal of 357 million in reserves related to potential income tax exposures that were resolved partially offset by lower interest and other income and lower gains on marketable securities and other investments net income after tax from continuing operations grew faster than revenue in fiscal 2003 primarily due to the factors cited above and to higher interest and other income and gains on marketable securities and other investments in fiscal 2003 partially offset by a fiscal 2002 gain on divestiture of businesses that did not recur in fiscal 2003 and a higher effective tax rate in fiscal 2003 than in fiscal 2002 diluted net income per share from continuing operations grew faster than net income after tax from continuing operations for fiscal 2004 and 2003 primarily due to the net reduction of average shares outstanding resulting from repurchases of stock under our stock repurchase programs at july 31 2004 our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments totaled 10 billion in fiscal 2004 we generated cash primarily from continuing operations and the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans and we used cash primarily for our stock repurchase programs acquisitions and capital expenditures in fiscal 2004 we bought 135 million shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs at an average price of 4501 for a total price of 6094 million we completed our third stock repurchase program in june 2004 and at july 31 2004 authorized funds of 5000 million remained available under our fourth program 25 

total net revenue the table below and the discussion of total net revenue that follows it are categorized by our five reportable business segments in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 we revised our reportable segments to reflect the way we currently manage our operations and view our results we combined our fiscal 2003 quickbooks segment with the businesses from our fiscal 2003 small business products and services segment that relate to and support quickbooks to form the fiscal 2004 segment called quickbooksrelated we also combined our outsourced payroll and information technology businesses with our fiscal 2003 vertical business management solutions segment to form the fiscal 2004 segment called intuitbranded small business we made no changes to our consumer tax professional tax and other businesses segments we have reclassified previously reported fiscal 2003 and 2002 segment results to be consistent with the fiscal 2004 presentation we reclassified a total of 281 million for certain fiscal 2003 electronic filing revenue in our consumer tax and professional tax segments from product revenue to service revenue to be consistent with our fiscal 2004 presentation total fiscal 2003 revenue for each of these segments did not change as a result of these reclassifications see note 11 to the financial statements for additional information about our business segments  

fiscal 2004 total net revenue increased compared with fiscal 2003 primarily due to growth in diy revenue in our quickbooksrelated segment and to growth in turbotax for the web and electronic filing services in our consumer tax segment fiscal 2003 total net revenue increased over fiscal 2002 primarily due to higher revenue in our quickbooksrelated consumer tax and intuitbranded small business segments in fiscal 2003 our intuitbranded small business segment included revenue from the date of acquisition for three companies we acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 and one company we acquired in the first quarter of fiscal 2003 total net revenue by business segment quickbooksrelated quickbooksrelated product revenue is derived primarily from quickbooks desktop software products quickbooks doityourself payroll or diy which offers payroll tax tables forms and electronic tax payment and filing on a subscription basis to small businesses that prepare their own payrolls and financial supplies such as paper checks envelopes and invoices quickbooksrelated service revenue is derived primarily from quickbooks online edition quickbooks support plans and merchant services other revenue for this segment consists primarily of royalties from small business online services fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003  quickbooksrelated total net revenue grew in fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003 due to increased sales of higherpriced industryspecific versions of quickbooks and higher diy revenue driven by growth in the average customer base an increase in quickbooksrelated services and the full impact in fiscal 2004 of a december 2002 price increase our october 2003 acquisition of innovative merchant solutions also contributed to the higher fiscal 2004 total net revenue fiscal 2003 compared with fiscal 2002  quickbooksrelated total net revenue increased in fiscal 2003 compared with fiscal 2002 reflecting higher quickbooks unit sales as well as higher average selling prices driven by the introduction of certain higherpriced quickbooks products and a shift in revenue mix toward those products diy revenue increased due to growth in the average customer base and higher average selling prices driven by price increases quickbooks support revenue grew due to an increase in the number of support plans sold and strength in the higherpriced support plans for higherend quickbooks products intuitbranded small business intuitbranded small business product revenue is derived primarily from business management software for information technology and four selected industries wholesale durable goods residential commercial and corporate property management construction and nonprofit organizations universities and government agencies in august 2004 management formally approved a plan to sell our intuit public sector solutions business intuitbranded small business service revenue is derived from technical support consulting and training services for those software products and from outsourced payroll services service revenue for this segment also includes interest earned on funds held for payroll customers fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003  intuitbranded small business total net revenue increased in fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003 primarily due to new client acquisition in our wholesale durable goods and property management solutions businesses as well as higher average selling prices from increased customer use of support and other services in these businesses and in our information technology business fiscal 2003 compared with fiscal 2002  intuitbranded small business total net revenue was higher in fiscal 2003 compared with fiscal 2002 due to our acquisition of several businesses higher outsourced payroll revenue in fiscal 2003 was primarily a result of our acquisition of cbs employer services inc in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 we also acquired our wholesale durable goods property management and nonprofit businesses in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 they contributed 806 million in revenue for fiscal 2003 compared with 34 million in fiscal 2002 finally we acquired intuit information technology solutions in the first quarter of fiscal 2003 27 

consumer tax consumer tax product revenue is derived primarily from turbotax federal and state consumer desktop tax return preparation software consumer tax service revenue is derived primarily from turbotax for the web online tax return preparation services and consumer electronic filing services fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003  consumer tax total net revenue increased in fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003 as a result of turbotax for the web and retail desktop unit growth higher attach rates for electronic filing services and higher average selling prices fiscal 2003 compared with fiscal 2002  consumer tax total net revenue grew in fiscal 2003 compared with fiscal 2002 due to an increase in desktop revenue that was driven by unit growth and higher average selling prices for federal tax offerings with enhanced functionality higher turbotax for the web revenue due to unit growth and higher average selling prices and an increase in electronic filing revenue due to higher federal desktop unit sales and higher average state electronic filing prices professional tax professional tax product revenue is derived primarily from proseries and lacerte professional tax preparation software products professional tax service revenue consists of electronic filing and training services fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003  professional tax total net revenue grew slightly in fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003 due to additional sales to existing customers higher average selling prices related to product enhancements and increased sales of our unlimited electronic filing product as a result of new government rules requiring the electronic filing of certain professionally prepared 2003 income tax returns however revenue growth in fiscal 2004 was negatively impacted by competition from lowerpriced professional tax preparation software products although we have revised our product strategy to address this competition for the 2004 tax year it is possible that this competition may continue to negatively affect revenue growth rates for our professional tax segment in the future fiscal 2003 compared with fiscal 2002  professional tax total net revenue grew in fiscal 2003 compared with fiscal 2002 due to price increases related to product enhancements new customer acquisition initiatives and successful crosssell efforts to the existing tax client base renewal rates for our existing customer base remained strong during fiscal 2003 other businesses other businesses consist primarily of quicken and canada quicken product revenue is derived primarily from quicken desktop software products quicken other revenue consists primarily of fees from consumer online transactions and from quickenbranded credit card and bill payment offerings that we provide through our partners we exited the online advertising business in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 in canada product revenue is derived primarily from localized versions of quickbooks and quicken as well as quicktax and taxwiz consumer desktop tax return preparation software and profile professional tax preparation products service revenue in canada consists primarily of revenue from software maintenance contracts sold with quickbooks fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003  other businesses total net revenue grew slightly in fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003 primarily due to higher quicken revenue in fiscal 2004 quicken direct unit sales increased in response to direct mail campaigns for upgrades due to the discontinuation of support for older versions of the product and for turbotax crossselling offers retail unit sales also increased aggregate average selling prices for quicken were higher in fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003 due to a shift in demand to our higherpriced quicken premier and quicken home and business products partially offsetting these increases quicken other revenue declined in fiscal 2004 due to the expiration or termination of contracts with several significant online advertising customers we exited the online advertising business in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 28 

canadian revenue in us dollars was slightly higher in fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003 due to the favorable effect of the strengthening canadian dollar in fiscal 2004 total net revenue in canadian dollars decreased in fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003 primarily due to lower demand for quickbooks in canada quicktax revenue was also down in fiscal 2004 due to a decline in unit sales that was partially offset by higher average selling prices related to a shift in demand toward the higherpriced specialty versions of that product fiscal 2003 compared with fiscal 2002  other businesses total net revenue increased slightly in fiscal 2003 compared with fiscal 2002 quicken revenue decreased while canadian revenue grew quicken product revenue decreased due to lack of growth in the market for personal finance desktop software and slow consumer spending lower unit sales for all quicken products more than offset higher average selling prices for quicken premier and quicken home and business quicken other revenue also decreased due to continuing slowness in internet advertising and our exit from certain online businesses in fiscal 2002 total net revenue from canada grew in fiscal 2003 compared with fiscal 2002 due partially to slightly higher revenue from quicktax higher average selling prices and higher unit sales for this product were fueled by the introduction of right for me consumer tax products targeted at taxpayers who maintain home offices or who are preparing for retirement our new taxwiz consumer tax preparation software also contributed to fiscal 2003 revenue growth canadian quickbooks revenue for fiscal 2003 declined due to lack of growth in the software category and decreases in the level of inventory purchasing by retailers cost of revenue  

our cost of revenue has four components 1 cost of product revenue which includes the direct costs of manufacturing and shipping our software products 2 cost of service revenue which reflects direct costs associated with providing services including data center costs related to delivering internetbased services 3 cost of other revenue which includes costs associated with generating advertising and marketing and online transaction revenue and 4 amortization of purchased software which represents the cost of amortizing developed technologies that we obtained through acquisitions over their useful lives fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003  cost of product revenue as a percentage of product revenue decreased slightly in fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003 this was primarily due to a continuing shift toward sales of our higherpriced quickbooks products and to lower royalties incurred for our consumer tax and quicken products cost of service revenue as a percentage of service revenue decreased in fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003 this decrease was due to growth in our consumer tax service revenue which had minimal incremental costs cost of service revenue as a percentage of service revenue also decreased in fiscal 2004 due to growth in revenue from the highermargin businesses we acquired during fiscal 2003 and 2004 notably intuit information technology solutions and innovative merchant solutions cost of other revenue as a percentage of other revenue increased in fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003 this was primarily due to declining quicken other revenue resulting from the fiscal 2004 expiration or termination of contracts with several significant online advertising customers which had minimal associated costs we exited the online advertising business in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 29 

fiscal 2003 compared with fiscal 2002  cost of product revenue as a percentage of product revenue decreased slightly in fiscal 2003 compared with fiscal 2002 this was primarily due to a shift toward sales of our new higherpriced quickbooks products which have higher margins per unit and to cost reductions due to improvements in packaging design and manufacturing processes during fiscal 2003 cost of service revenue as a percentage of service revenue decreased in fiscal 2003 compared with fiscal 2002 primarily as a result of growth in our outsourced payroll business during fiscal 2003 in addition starting in the third quarter of fiscal 2003 we no longer paid royalties to wells fargo bank for our premier payroll service although we amortized the 292 million purchase price of the right to market to this customer base to cost of service revenue in fiscal 2003 the amortization expense was less than the royalties that would have been incurred under the old agreement cost of other revenue as a percentage of other revenue decreased in fiscal 2003 compared with fiscal 2002 in the first quarter of fiscal 2002 we moved a large number of servers that supported our quickencom web site from an external hosting company to our own data center and streamlined the infrastructure over time this led to decreased cost of other revenue for this business operating expenses  

overview of operating expenses we define core operating expenses as the controllable costs of running our business total core operating expenses increased in fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003 and in fiscal 2003 compared with fiscal 2002 individually and in the aggregate core operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenue were generally consistent in these 30 

periods operating expenses that changed by more than 1 of total net revenue from fiscal 2002 to fiscal 2004 are discussed below customer service and technical support customer service and technical support expenses declined as a percentage of total net revenue in fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003 and in fiscal 2003 compared with fiscal 2002 we continued to increase our efficiency in these periods by improving our utilization of internal customer service representatives and by outsourcing some of our seasonal call center capabilities we also increased the proportion of customer service and technical support we provide through less expensive methods such as web sites online chat email and other electronic means these benefits were partially offset by higher demand for customer service and technical support due to the increased number of our offerings general and administrative general administrative expenses increased as a percentage of total net revenue in fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003 and in fiscal 2003 compared with fiscal 2002 due to increased spending for infrastructure and new information systems acquisitionrelated charges fiscal 2004 and 2003 acquisitionrelated charges declined significantly compared with fiscal 2002 fiscal 2002 acquisitionrelated charges included the amortization of goodwill due to our adoption of sfas 142 fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 acquisitionrelated charges did not include the amortization of goodwill loss on impairment of goodwill and purchased intangible assets during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 events and circumstances indicated impairment of goodwill that we recorded in connection with our acquisition of intuit public sector solutions ipss became part of our intuitbranded small business segment the primary indicator of impairment was the fact that actual sales levels did not meet initial projections based on our analysis in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 we recorded a charge of 187 million to reduce the carrying value of the goodwill to 109 million in august 2004 management formally approved a plan to sell ipss see note 4 to the financial statements the fiscal 2002 loss on impairment of goodwill and purchased intangible assets related to certain internetbased businesses in our intuitbranded small business and other businesses segments indicators of impairment included a steep decline in demand for online advertising reflecting the industrywide decline in internet advertising spending and our decision to eliminate the use of certain technology purchased from one of the businesses based on our analyses in the second quarter of fiscal 2002 we recorded charges totaling 273 million to reduce the carrying value of the goodwill and purchased intangible assets associated with these businesses to zero see note 4 to the financial statements loss on impairment of longlived asset in connection with the sale of our quicken bill manager business in may 2001 we acquired a 270 million longterm asset related to future consideration from the buyer during fiscal 2002 events and circumstances indicated impairment of this asset and we recorded a charge of 270 million to reduce its carrying value to zero see note 10 to the financial statements segment operating income loss segment operating income or loss is segment net revenue less segment cost of revenue and operating expenses segment expenses do not include certain costs such as corporate general and administrative expenses that are not allocated to specific segments in addition segment expenses do not include acquisitionrelated costs which include acquisitionrelated charges goodwill and purchased intangible asset impairment charges amortization of purchased software and charges for purchased research and development segment expenses also do not include realized net 31 

gains or losses on marketable securities and other investments and interest and other income see note 11 to the financial statements for reconciliations of total segment operating income to income from operations for each fiscal year presented  

quickbooksrelated fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003  the increase in quickbooksrelated segment operating income in fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003 was primarily due to 18 higher revenue that included strong growth in our highmargin diy payroll business in addition fiscal 2004 operating income for this segment included operating income for innovative merchant solutions which we acquired in the first quarter of fiscal 2004 these factors were partially offset by increases in spending for quickbooks product development technical support marketing programs and direct sales personnel and infrastructure fiscal 2003 compared with fiscal 2002  the increase in quickbooksrelated segment operating income in fiscal 2003 compared with fiscal 2002 was primarily due to 20 higher revenue that included strong growth in our highmargin diy payroll business these factors were partially offset by increases in spending for product development marketing sales and technical support for industryspecific versions of quickbooks that launched late in fiscal 2002 and throughout fiscal 2003 intuitbranded small business fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003  our intuitbranded small business segment had operating income in fiscal 2004 after it broke even in fiscal 2003 because revenue for this segment grew 14 while we held costs steady in our information technology and industry solutions businesses partially offsetting these improvements outsourced payroll operating income was lower in fiscal 2004 because we incurred expenses for additional sales and service personnel during the first half of the year that were not completely offset by increased revenue fiscal 2003 compared with fiscal 2002  intuitbranded small business broke even in fiscal 2003 after experiencing an operating loss in fiscal 2002 the primary reasons for the improvement in operating margin were growth in our outsourced payroll business and our acquisition of intuit information technology solutions in the first quarter of fiscal 2003 consumer tax fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003  consumer tax segment operating income growth in fiscal 2004 was slightly above revenue growth for that period because gross margin improvements due to higher average selling prices and growing highmargin service revenues were only partially offset by additional costs incurred for national television and radio advertising in fiscal 2004 fiscal 2003 compared with fiscal 2002  consumer tax segment operating income growth in fiscal 2003 was above revenue growth for that period as improvements in average selling prices were partially offset by additional costs incurred for higher partner royalties and infrastructure 32 

professional tax fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003  professional tax segment operating income declined slightly on a 3 revenue increase in fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003 segment operating income did not grow in fiscal 2004 because of increased spending on product development and customer service fiscal 2003 compared with fiscal 2002  professional tax segment operating income grew in fiscal 2003 compared with fiscal 2002 due to streamlining of training and materials costs that produced higher gross margins on 8 revenue growth operating expenses for this segment remained relatively flat in fiscal 2003 due to staffing efficiencies achieved in customer service other businesses fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003  other businesses segment operating income grew faster than revenue due primarily to quicken revenue increases on relatively flat costs and our exit from the online brokerage business in the first quarter of fiscal 2004 partially offsetting the quicken improvements canadian operating income was down in fiscal 2004 fiscal 2003 compared with fiscal 2002  other businesses segment operating income grew during fiscal 2003 compared with fiscal 2002 as a result of reduced spending in our quicken online advertising business and reduction of other quicken operating expenses as operational efficiencies were introduced canadian operating income was also slightly higher in fiscal 2003 nonoperating income and expenses interest and other income  

total interest and other income declined in fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003 but increased in fiscal 2003 compared with fiscal 2002 the interest income that we earn on our cash and shortterm investment balances decreased 81 million in fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003 and 96 million in fiscal 2003 compared with fiscal 2002 due to our reinvestment of maturing instruments in new instruments that generally yielded lower current market interest rates in addition due to the company’s continued investment in its stock repurchase programs and in acquisitions average invested balances were lower in fiscal 2004 than in fiscal 2003 and were lower in fiscal 2003 than in fiscal 2002 fiscal 2004 and 2003 interest and other income included royalties from trademark license and distribution agreements that we entered into when we sold our mortgage business in july 2002 see note 9 to the financial statements this is the primary reason for the increase in total interest and other income in fiscal 2003 compared with fiscal 2002 interest and other income also includes net gains resulting from foreign exchange transactions that were due primarily to the effect of the weakening us dollar on intercompany balances with our canadian subsidiary 33 

gains losses on marketable securities and other investments net we recorded pretax net gains relating to marketable securities and other investments in fiscal 2004 and 2003 while we recorded a pretax net loss relating to marketable securities and other investments in fiscal 2002 the fiscal 2003 net gain and fiscal 2002 net loss included charges totaling 28 million and 95 million to write down certain longterm investments for which the decline in fair value below carrying value was otherthantemporary gain on divestiture of business in march 2002 we paid 120 million to terminate our remaining 203 million obligation under an interactive services agreement related to our quicken bill manager business which we sold in may 2001 we recorded a pretax gain of 83 million in connection with the termination of this agreement income taxes our effective tax rate was 30 for fiscal 2004 33 for fiscal 2003 and 24 for fiscal 2002 our effective tax rate for fiscal 2004 differed from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the net effect of reversals of 357 million in reserves related to potential income tax exposures that have been resolved and to the benefit received from taxexempt interest income and various tax credits offset by state taxes acquisitionrelated charges and deferred tax adjustments our effective tax rate for fiscal 2003 differed from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the net effect of the benefit received from taxexempt interest income and various tax credits offset by state taxes and acquisitionrelated charges our effective tax rate for fiscal 2002 differed from the federal statutory rate primarily due to a tax benefit related to a divestiture that became available during the year and to taxexempt interest income offset by nondeductible merger related charges see note 14 to the financial statements at july 31 2004 we had net deferred tax assets of 1672 million which included a valuation allowance of 75 million for net operating loss carryforwards relating to our international subsidiaries and certain state capital loss carryforwards the allowance reflects management’s assessment that we may not receive the benefit of certain loss carryforwards of our international subsidiaries and capital loss carryforwards in certain state jurisdictions while we believe our current valuation allowance is sufficient it may be necessary to increase this amount if it becomes more likely that we will not realize a greater portion of the net deferred tax assets we assess the need for an adjustment to the valuation allowance on a quarterly basis see note 14 to the financial statements discontinued operations intuit kk in february 2003 we sold our wholly owned japanese subsidiary intuit kk and accounted for the sale as discontinued operations in accordance with sfas 144 we have segregated the operating results of intuit kk from continuing operations on our statement of operations for all periods prior to the sale we recorded a gain on disposal of these discontinued operations of 710 million net of income taxes of 51 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2003 see note 9 to the financial statements quicken loans in july 2002 we sold 875 of our quicken loans mortgage business segment and accounted for the sale as discontinued operations in accordance with apb 30 we have segregated the operating results of quicken loans from continuing operations on our statement of operations for all periods prior to the sale we recorded a net gain on disposal of these discontinued operations of 233 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 in october 2002 we sold our residual equity interest in the purchasing company and recognized a net gain of 56 million on the transaction we receive royalties and fees under certain licensing and distribution agreements that relate to our former quicken loans business we record these amounts as other income on our statement of operations see note 9 to the financial statements 34 

liquidity and capital resources statements of cash flows at july 31 2004 our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments totaled 10 billion a decrease of 1876 million from july 31 2003 in fiscal 2004 we generated cash primarily from continuing operations and the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans and we used cash primarily for our stock repurchase programs acquisitions and capital expenditures the following table summarizes selected items from our statements of cash flows for fiscal 2004 2003 and 2002 see the financial statements for complete statements of cash flows for those periods  

we generated cash from our operations during fiscal 2004 2003 and 2002 including net income from continuing operations in each of those years acquisitionrelated costs were significantly higher in fiscal 2002 than in fiscal 2003 and 2004 primarily because we amortized goodwill in fiscal 2002 due to our adoption of sfas 142 we stopped amortizing goodwill in fiscal 2003 acquisitionrelated costs also included impairments of goodwill and purchased intangible assets of 273 million in fiscal 2002 and 187 million in fiscal 2004 we used cash for investing activities during fiscal 2004 2003 and 2002 our primary use of cash for investing activities was for business acquisitions on a net basis we invested cash in availableforsale debt securities in fiscal 2004 and 2003 while we drew cash from them in fiscal 2002 we used cash for our financing activities in fiscal 2004 2003 and 2002 primarily for the repurchase of stock under our stock repurchase programs see “stock repurchase programs” below and note 15 to the financial statements this was partially offset by proceeds that we received from the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans in each of these fiscal years cash generated by discontinued operations in fiscal 2003 included collection of 2416 million in amounts due from quicken loans and intuit kk and a net gain of 710 million from the sale of intuit kk cash generated by discontinued operations during fiscal 2002 was primarily from collection of 1081 million in amounts due from quicken loans and intuit kk net income from discontinued operations of 632 million and a gain of 233 million on the sale of quicken loans 35 

stock repurchase programs intuit’s board of directors has initiated a series of common stock repurchase programs shares of common stock repurchased under these programs become treasury shares the following table summarizes our stock repurchase programs at july 31 2004  

loans to executive officers and other employees outstanding loans to executive officers and other employees totaled 171 million at july 31 2004 and 197 million at july 31 2003 loans to executive officers are primarily relocation loans that are generally secured by real property and have original maturity dates of up to 10 years at july 31 2004 no loans were overdue and all interest payments were current in accordance with the terms of the loan agreements consistent with the requirements of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 no loans to executive officers have been made or modified since july 30 2002 and we do not intend to make or modify loans to executive officers in the future see note 19 to the financial statements other we evaluate on an ongoing basis the merits of acquiring technology or businesses or establishing strategic relationships with and investing in other companies we may decide to use cash and cash equivalents to fund such activities in the future we believe that our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments will be sufficient to meet anticipated seasonal working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations to make future payments at july 31 2004

recent accounting pronouncements on march 31 2004 the fasb issued its exposure draft “sharebased payment” which is a proposed amendment to sfas 123 the exposure draft would require all sharebased payments to employees including grants of employee stock options and purchases under employee stock purchase plans to be recognized as expenses in the statement of operations based on their fair values and vesting periods the fasb expects to issue a final standard late in 2004 that would be effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2004 we have not yet assessed the impact of adopting this new standard see note 1 to the financial statements 37 

risks that could affect future results we face intense competitive pressures in all of our businesses that may negatively impact our revenue profitability and market position we have formidable competitors and we expect competition to remain intense during fiscal 2005 and beyond the number resources and sophistication of the companies with whom we compete has increased as we continue to expand our product and service offerings microsoft corporation in particular presents a significant threat to a number of our businesses due to its market position strategic focus and superior financial resources our competitors may introduce new and improved products and services bundle new offerings with marketleading products reduce prices gain better access to distribution channels advertise aggressively or beat us to market with new products and services any of these competitive actions – particularly any prolonged price competition – could diminish our revenue and profitability and could affect our ability to keep existing customers and acquire new customers some additional competitive factors that may impact our businesses are as follows quickbooksrelated  losing existing or potential quickbooks customers to competitors causes us to lose potential software revenue and limits our opportunities to sell related products and services such as our financial supplies diy payroll and merchant service offerings many competitors and potential competitors provide or have expressed significant interest in providing accounting and business management products and services to small businesses for example microsoft currently offers a number of competitive small business offerings and has indicated part of its growth strategy is to focus on small business offerings accordingly we expect that competition from microsoft in the small business area will intensify over time with the introduction of small business offerings that directly compete with our quickbooks and other offerings given its market position and resources if microsoft launches additional products and services that directly compete with our offerings it may have a significant negative impact on our revenue and profitability consumer tax  our consumer tax business faces significant competition from both the public and private sector in the public sector we face the risk of federal and state taxing authorities developing or contracting to provide software or other systems to facilitate tax return preparation and electronic filing at no charge to taxpayers   38 

 other segments intuitbranded small business professional tax and other businesses  our professional tax offerings face pricing pressure from competitors seeking to obtain our customers through deep product discounts and loss of customers to competitors offering nofrills offerings at low prices this business also faces competition from competitivelypriced integrated accounting solutions that are more complete than our current offerings the substantial size of our principal competitors in the outsourced payroll services business and our merchant card processing service business benefit from greater economies of scale that may result in pricing pressure for our offerings the growth of electronic banking and other electronic payment systems is decreasing the demand for checks and consequently causing pricing pressure for our supplies products as competitors aggressively compete for share of this shrinking market our quicken products compete both with microsoft money which is aggressively promoted and priced and with webbased electronic banking and personal finance tracking and management tools that are becoming increasingly available at no cost to consumers these competitive pressures may result in reduced revenue and lower profitability for our quicken product line and related bill payment service offering the growth of some of our businesses is slowing and if we do not continue to introduce new and enhanced products and services our revenues and margins will decline we are seeing a slowdown in the revenue growth rate for some of our businesses as they mature this trend causes our product development efforts to be even more critical to our success product and service enhancements are necessary for us to differentiate our offerings from those of our competitors and to motivate our existing customers to purchase upgrades or annual licenses in the case of our tax offerings a number of our businesses derive a significant amount of their revenue through onetime upfront license fees and rely on customer upgrades and service offerings that include upgrades to generate a significant portion of their revenues as our existing products mature encouraging customers to purchase product upgrades becomes more challenging unless new product releases provide features and functionality that have meaningful incremental value if we are not able to develop and clearly demonstrate the value of upgraded products to our customers our upgrade and service revenues will be negatively impacted similarly our business will be harmed if we are not successful in our efforts to develop and introduce new products and services that expand our customer base and revenues per customer we are implementing new information systems and problems with the design or implementation of these systems could interfere with our business and operations we are in the process of implementing new information systems to replace existing systems that manage our business and finance operations due to the size and complexity of our portfolio of businesses the conversion process is very challenging we began switching over in large part to the new information systems in september 2004 with the upgrade of significant financial systems ordertaking systems middleware systems systems to allow for interoperability of different databases and network security systems although the upgraded systems appear to be functioning in a stable manner and performing tasks at acceptable performance levels for our current business demands we may still encounter difficulties as our business demands increase and as greater functionality from the systems is required for example we have not yet successfully closed a financial reporting period with data generated by the upgraded systems similarly the upgraded systems have not yet been subject to and may not be able to handle the demand peaks caused by the seasonal nature of our business in addition although the switch over of our more critical systems is underway we will be continuing to replace existing systems throughout fiscal year 2005 any disruptions relating to our systems enhancements particularly any disruptions impacting our operations during our second and third fiscal quarters could adversely impact our ability to do the following in a timely and accurate manner take customer orders ship products provide services and support to our customers bill and track our customers fulfill contractual obligations and otherwise run our business even if we do succeed the implementation may be much more costly than we anticipated if we are unable to successfully implement new information systems as planned in addition to adversely impacting our financial position results of operations and cash flows in the short and long term it could also affect our ability to collect the information necessary to timely file our first quarter fiscal 2005 financial reports with the sec 39 

our new product and service offerings may not achieve market success or may cannibalize sales of our existing products causing our revenues and earnings to decrease our future success depends in large part upon our ability to identify emerging opportunities in our target markets and our capacity to quickly develop and sell products and services that satisfy these demands in a cost effective manner successfully predicting demand trends is difficult and we may expend a significant amount of resources and management attention on products or services that do not succeed in their markets we have encountered difficulty in launching new products and services in the past for example in 2003 we ended our quicken brokerage service offering due to lack of customer acceptance if we misjudge customer needs our new products and services will not succeed and our revenues and earnings will be negatively impacted in addition as we expand our offerings to new customer categories we run the risk of customers shifting from higher priced and higher margin products to newly introduced lower priced offerings if we experience significant product quality problems or delays it will harm our revenues operating income and reputation all of our tax products and many of our nontax products have rigid development timetables that increase the risk of errors in our products and the risk of launch delays many of our products are highly complex and require interoperability with other software products and services our tax preparation software product development cycle is particularly challenging due to the need to incorporate unpredictable tax law and tax form changes each year and because our customers expect high levels of accuracy and a timely launch of these products to prepare and file their taxes by april 15th due to this complexity and the condensed development cycles under which we operate our products sometimes contain “bugs” that can unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the software for example our software may face interoperability difficulties with software operating systems or programs being used by our customers when we encounter problems we may be required to modify our code distribute patches to customers that had already purchased the product and recall or repackage existing product inventory in our distribution channels if we encounter development challenges or discover errors in our products late in our development cycle it may cause us to delay our product launch date any major defects or launch delays could lead to the following        if we fail to maintain reliable and responsive service levels for our electronic tax offerings or if the irs or other governmental agencies experience difficulties in receiving customer submissions we could lose revenue and customers our webbased tax preparation and electronic filing services must effectively handle extremely heavy customer demand during the peak tax season we face significant risks and challenges in maintaining these services and maintaining adequate service levels particularly during peak volume service times similarly governmental entities receiving electronic tax filings must also handle large volumes of data and may experience difficulties with their systems preventing the receipt of electronic filings if customers are unable to file their returns electronically they may elect to make paper filings this would result in reduced electronic tax return preparation and filing revenues and profits and would negatively impact our reputation and ability to keep and attract customers who demand a reliable electronic filing experience we have experienced relatively brief unscheduled interruptions in our electronic filing andor tax preparation services during past tax years for example on april 15 2003 we experienced a relatively brief unscheduled interruption in our electronic filing service during which certain users of our professional tax products were unable to receive confirmation from us that their electronic filing had been accepted and on april 15 2002 we reached maximum capacity for processing efilings for short period of time if we experience any prolonged difficulties with our webbased tax preparation or electronic filing service at any time during the tax season we could lose current and future customers receive negative publicity and incur increased 40 

operating costs any of which could have a significant negative impact on the financial and market success of these businesses and have a negative impact on our nearterm and longterm financial results our revenue and earnings are highly seasonal and our quarterly results fluctuate significantly several of our businesses are highly seasonal causing significant quarterly fluctuations in our financial results revenue and operating results are usually strongest during the second and third fiscal quarters ending january 31 and april 30 due to our tax businesses contributing most of their revenue during those quarters and the timing of the release of our small business software upgrades we experience lower revenues and significant operating losses in the first and fourth quarters ending october 31 and july 31 our financial results can also fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year due to a variety of factors including changes in product sales mix that affect average selling prices product release dates the timing of our discontinuance of support for older product offerings the timing of sales of our higherpriced intuitbranded small business offerings our methods for distributing our products including the shift to a consignment model for some of our desktop products sold through retail distribution channels and the timing of acquisitions divestitures and goodwill and purchased intangible asset impairment charges as our product and service offerings become more complex our revenue streams become less predictable our expanding range of products and services generates more varied revenue streams than our traditional desktop software businesses the accounting policies that apply to these revenue streams are more complex than those that apply to our traditional products and services we expect this trend to continue as we acquire additional companies and expand our offerings for example as we begin to offer additional features and options as part of multipleelement sales arrangements we could be required to defer a higher percentage of our product revenue at the time of sale than we do for traditional products this would decrease recognized revenue at the time products are shipped but result in increased recognized revenue in fiscal periods after shipment for example some of our turbotax offerings provide for both use of our software and filing of returns electronically causing some of our revenue to be deferred until the time of the actual filing of tax returns by our customers in addition our intuitbranded small business segment businesses offer products and services with significantly higher prices than we have traditionally offered revenue from these offerings tends to be less predictable than revenue from our traditional desktop products due to longer sales and implementation cycles these businesses also tend to rely on a relatively small number of large orders for a substantial portion of their revenue in a particular quarter which could cause our quarterly revenue from these businesses to fluctuate acquisitionrelated costs and impairment charges can cause significant fluctuation in our net income our recent acquisitions have resulted in significant expenses including amortization of purchased software which is reflected in cost of revenue as well as charges for inprocess research and development and amortization and impairment of goodwill purchased intangible assets and deferred compensation which are reflected in operating expenses total acquisitionrelated costs in the categories identified above were 1960 million in fiscal 2002 566 million in fiscal 2003 and 566 million in fiscal 2004 fiscal 2003 and 2004 acquisitionrelated costs have declined primarily because of a change in the accounting treatment of goodwill however we may incur less frequent but larger impairment charges related to the goodwill already recorded and to goodwill arising out of future acquisitions we test the impairment of goodwill annually in our fourth fiscal quarter or more frequently if indicators of impairment arise the timing of the formal annual test may result in charges to our statement of operations in our fourth fiscal quarter that could not have been reasonably foreseen in prior periods for example at the end of fiscal 2004 we incurred an impairment charge of 187 million related to our acquisition of intuit public sector solutions as of july 31 2004 we had an unamortized goodwill balance of approximately 6700 million which could be subject to impairment charges in the future new acquisitions and any impairment of the value of purchased assets could have a significant negative impact on our future operating results if we do not respond promptly and effectively to customer service and technical support inquiries we will lose customers and our revenues will decline the effectiveness of our customer service and technical support operations are critical to customer satisfaction and our financial success if we do not respond effectively to service and technical support requests we will lose customers and miss out on potential revenue opportunities such as paid service and new product sales in our 41 

service offerings such as our merchant card processing and outsourced payroll businesses customer service delivery is fundamental to retaining and maintaining existing customer and acquiring new customers we occasionally experience customer service and technical support problems including longer than expected waiting times for customers when our staffing and systems are inadequate to handle a higherthananticipated volume of requests we also risk losing service at any one of our customer contact centers and our redundancy systems could prove inadequate to provide backup support training and retaining qualified customer service and technical support personnel is particularly challenging due to the expansion of our product offerings and the seasonality of our tax business for example in fiscal 2004 the number of our consumer tax service representatives ranged from 10 during offseason months to about 750 at the peak of the season if we do not adequately train our support representatives our customers will not receive the level of support that they demand and we strive to deliver to improve our performance in this area we must eliminate underlying causes of service and support requests through product improvements better order fulfillment processes more robust selfhelp tools and improved ability to accurately anticipate demand for support implementing any of these improvements can be expensive time consuming and ultimately prove unsuccessful if we do not deliver the high level of support that our customers expect for any of the reasons stated above we will lose customers and our financial results will suffer if we encounter problems with our thirdparty customer service and technical support providers our business will be harmed and margins will decline we outsource a substantial portion of our customer support activities to thirdparty service providers most significantly to service providers in india during fiscal 2004 we greatly increased the number of thirdparty customer service representatives working on our behalf and we expect to continue to rely heavily on third parties in the future this strategy provides us with lower operating costs and greater flexibility but also presents risks to our business including the following        we face significant risks in our retail distribution channel that could result in loss of revenues and reduced margins we sell most of our desktop software products through our retail distribution channel and a relatively small number of retailers generate much of our sales volume our principal retailers have significant bargaining leverage due to their size and available resources any change in principal business terms termination or major disruption of our relationship with these resellers could result in a potentially significant decline in our revenues and earnings for example the sourcing decisions product display locations and promotional activities that retailers undertake can greatly impact the sales of our products due to its seasonal nature sales of turbotax are particularly impacted by such decisions and if our principal distribution sources were to elect to carry or promote competitive products our revenues would decline the fact that we also sell our products directly could cause retailers to reduce their efforts to promote our products or stop selling our products altogether if any of our retailers run into financial difficulties we may be unable to collect amounts that we are owed 42 

selling new products may be more challenging and costlier than selling our historical products causing our margins to decline because our strategy for some of our products involves the routine introduction of new products at retail if retailers do not offer our new products we will not be able to grow as planned an outcome of our “right for me” marketing approach is the introduction of additional versions of our products retailers may be reluctant to stock unproven products or products that sell at higher prices but more slowly retailers may also choose to place less emphasis on software as a category within their stores in addition it may be costlier for us to market and sell some of our higher priced products due to our need to convey the more customerspecific value of the products to customers rather than communicating more generalized benefits this may require us to develop other marketing programs that supplement our traditional instore promotional efforts to sell these products to customers causing our margins to shrink if retail distribution proves an ineffective channel for certain of our new offerings it could adversely impact our growth revenue and profitability if our manufacturing and distribution suppliers execute poorly our business will be harmed we have chosen to outsource the manufacturing and distribution of many of our desktop software products to a small number of third party providers and we use a single vendor to produce and distribute our check and business forms supplies products although our reliance on a small number of suppliers or a single supplier provides us with efficiencies and enhanced bargaining power poor performance by or lack of effective communication with these parties can significantly harm our business this risk is amplified by the fact that we carry very little inventory and rely on justintime manufacturing processes we have experienced problems with our suppliers in the past for example during fiscal 2004 one of our suppliers was unable to fulfill orders for some of our software products for a number of days due to operational difficulties and communication errors although together we were able to mitigate the impact of that delay with minimal disruption to our business if we experience longer delays delays during a peak demand period or significant quality issues our business will be significantly harmed failure of our information technology systems or those of our service providers could adversely affect our future operating results we rely on a variety of internal technology systems and technology systems maintained by our outside manufacturing and distribution suppliers to take and fulfill customer orders handle customer service requests host our webbased activities support internal operations and store customer and company data these systems could be damaged or interrupted preventing us or our service providers from accepting and fulfilling customer orders or otherwise interrupting our business in addition these systems could suffer security breaches causing company and customer data to be unintentionally disclosed any of these occurrences could adversely impact our operations we have experienced system challenges in the past for example during fiscal 2004 some of our noncritical systems were interrupted due to computer viruses that caused loss of productivity and added expense we also experience computer server failures from time to time to prevent interruptions we must continually upgrade our systems and processes to ensure that we have adequate recoverability – both of which are costly and time consuming while we and our outside service partners have backup systems for certain aspects of our operations not all systems upon which we rely are fully redundant and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities possession and use of personal customer information by our businesses presents risks and expenses that could harm our business a number of our businesses possess personal customer information possession and use of this information in conducting our business subjects us to regulatory burdens and potential lawsuits we have incurred – and will continue to incur – significant expenses to comply with mandatory privacy and security standards and protocols and there is a trend toward greater regulation of privacy for example regulations like the recently created federal “do not call list” and actions by internet service providers to limit communications with their subscribers may impede our ability to communicate with our customers and increase our compliance costs because our businesses rely heavily on direct marketing any limitations on our ability to communicate with our customers could harm our financial results in the past we have experienced lawsuits and negative publicity relating to privacy issues and we could face similar suits in the future a major breach of customer privacy or security by intuit or even another company could have serious negative consequences for our businesses including direct damages that we may be 43 

required to pay as a result of a breach by us reduced customer demand for our services and additional regulation by federal or state agencies although we have sophisticated network security internal control measures and physical security procedures to safeguard customer information there can be no assurance that a data security breach or theft will not occur resulting in harm to our business and results of operations if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights competitors may exploit our innovations which could weaken our competitive position and reduce our revenues our success depends upon our proprietary technology we rely on a combination of copyright trade secret trademark patent confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights as part of our confidentiality procedures we generally enter into nondisclosure agreements with our employees contractors distributors and corporate partners and into license agreements with respect to our software documentation and other proprietary information effectively creating and protecting our proprietary rights is expensive and may require us to engage in expensive and distracting litigation despite these precautions third parties could copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology without authorization because we outsource significant aspects of our product development manufacturing and distribution we are at risk that confidential portions of our intellectual property could become public by lapses in security by our contractors we have licensed in the past and expect to license in the future certain of our proprietary rights such as trademarks or copyrighted material to others these licensees may take actions that diminish the value of our proprietary rights or harm our reputation it is also possible that other companies could successfully challenge the validity or scope of our patents and that our patent portfolio which is relatively small may not provide us with a meaningful competitive advantage ultimately our attempts to secure legal protection for our proprietary rights may not be adequate and our competitors could independently develop similar technologies duplicate our products or design around patents and other intellectual property rights if our intellectual property protection proves inadequate we could lose our competitive advantage and our financial results will suffer we expect copying and misuse of our intellectual property to be a persistent problem causing lost revenue and increased expenses our intellectual property rights are among our most valuable assets policing unauthorized use and copying of our products is difficult expensive and time consuming current us laws that prohibit copying give us only limited practical protection from software piracy and the laws of many other countries provide very little protection we may not be able to prevent misappropriation of our technology for example we frequently encounter unauthorized copies of our software being sold through online auction sites and other online marketplaces in addition efforts to protect our intellectual property may be misunderstood and perceived negatively by our customers for example during 2003 we employed technology to prohibit unauthorized sharing of our turbotax products these efforts were not effectively communicated causing a negative reaction by some of our customers who misunderstood our actions although we continue to evaluate technology solutions to piracy and we continue to increase our civil and criminal enforcement efforts we expect piracy to be a persistent problem that results in lost revenues and increased expenses we do not own all of the software other technologies and content used in our products and services many of our products are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties we believe we have all of the necessary licenses from third parties to use and distribute third party technology and content that we do not own that is used in our current products and services from time to time we may be required to renegotiate with these third parties – or negotiate with new third parties – to include their technology or content in our existing products in new versions of our existing products or in wholly new products we may not be able to negotiate or renegotiate licenses on reasonable terms or at all if we are unable to obtain the rights necessary to use or continue to use thirdparty technology or content in our products and services we may not be able to sell the affected products which would in turn have a negative impact on our revenue and operating results we may unintentionally infringe the intellectual property rights of others which could expose us to substantial damages or restrict our business operations as the number of our products and services increases and their features and content continue to expand and as we acquire technology through acquisitions or licenses we may increasingly become subject to infringement claims by third parties we expect that software products in general will increasingly be subject to these claims as the number 44 

of products and competitors increase the functionality of products overlap and as the patenting of software functionality continues to grow from time to time we have received communications from third parties in which the claimant alleges that a product or service we offer infringes the claimant’s intellectual property rights occasionally these communications result in lawsuits in many of these cases it is difficult to assess the extent to which the intellectual property right that the claimant asserts is valid or the extent to which we have any material exposure the receipt of a notice alleging infringement may require us to obtain a costly opinion of counsel to prevent an allegation of intentional infringement future claims could present an exposure of uncertain magnitude existing or future infringement claims or lawsuits against us whether valid or not may be time consuming and expensive to defend and be distracting to our developers and management intellectual property litigation or claims could force us to do one or more of the following cease selling incorporating or using products or services that incorporate the challenged intellectual property obtain a license from the holder of the infringed intellectual property which may not be available on commercially favorable terms or at all or redesign our software products or services possibly in a manner that reduces their commercial appeal any of these actions may cause material harm to our business and financial results our acquisition activity could disrupt our ongoing business and may present risks not contemplated at the time of the transactions we have acquired and may continue to acquire companies products and technologies that complement our strategic direction for example over the last three fiscal years we have acquired the stock or assets of eight companies these acquisitions may involve significant risks and uncertainties including         acquisitions are inherently risky we can not be certain that our previous or future acquisitions will be successful and will not materially adversely affect the conduct operating results or financial condition of our business we have generally paid cash for our recent acquisitions if we issue common stock or other equity related purchase rights as consideration in an acquisition current shareholders’ percentage ownership and earnings per share may become diluted if we fail to operate our outsourced payroll business effectively our revenue and profitability will be harmed our payroll business handles a significant amount of dollar and transaction volume due to the size and volume of transactions that we handle effective processing systems and controls are essential to ensure that transactions are handled appropriately despite our efforts it is possible that we may make errors or that funds may be misappropriated in addition to any direct damages and fines that any such problems would create which could be substantial the loss of customer confidence in our accuracy and controls would seriously harm our business our payroll business has grown largely through acquisitions and our systems are comprised of multiple technology platforms that are difficult to scale we must constantly continue to upgrade our systems and processes to ensure that we process customer data in an accurate reliable and timely manner these upgrades must also meet the various regulatory deadlines associated with employerrelated payroll activities any failure of our systems or processes in critical switchover times such as in january when many businesses elect to change payroll service providers would be detrimental to our business if we failed to timely deliver any of our payroll products it could cause our current and prospective customers to choose a competitor’s product for that year’s payroll and not to purchase intuit products in the future to generate sustained growth in our payroll business we must successfully develop and manage a more proactive inside and field sales operation if these efforts are not successful our revenue growth and profitability will decline 45 

interest income attributable to payroll customer deposits may fluctuate or be eliminated causing our revenue and profitability to decline we currently earn revenue from interest earned on customer deposits that we hold pending payment of funds to taxing authorities or to customers’ employees if interest rates decline or there are regulatory changes that diminish the amount of time that we are required or permitted to hold such funds our interest revenue will decline we face a number of risks in our merchant card processing business that could result in a reduction in our revenues and profits our merchant card processing service business is subject to the following risks          should any of these risks be realized our business could be harmed and our financial results will suffer increased state filing mandates could significantly increase our costs we are required to comply with a variety of state revenue agency standards in order to successfully operate our tax preparation and electronic filing services changes in stateimposed requirements by one or more of the states including the required use of specific technologies or technology standards could significantly increase the costs of providing those services to our customers and could prevent us from delivering a quality product to our customers in a timely manner we may be unable to attract and retain key personnel much of our future success depends on the continued service and availability of skilled personnel including members of our executive team and those in technical marketing and staff positions experienced personnel in the software and services industries are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense especially in the silicon valley and san diego california where the majority of our employees are located although we strive to be an employer of choice we may not be able to continue to successfully attract and retain key personnel which would cause our business to suffer if actual product returns exceed returns reserves or if customer rebates exceed historical amounts our revenue would be lower we ship more desktop software products to our distributors and retailers than we expect them to sell in order to reduce the risk that distributors or retailers will run out of products this is particularly true for our consumer tax products which have a short selling season and for which returns occur primarily in our fourth fiscal quarter like 46 

most software companies we have historically accepted significant product returns we establish reserves against revenue for product returns in our financial statements based on estimated future returns of products we closely monitor levels of product sales and inventory in the retail channel in an effort to maintain reserves that are adequate to cover expected returns in the past returns have not generally exceeded these reserves however if we do experience actual returns that significantly exceed reserves it would result in lower net revenue in addition our policy of recognizing revenue from distributors and retailers upon delivery of product for nonconsignment sales is predicated upon our ability to reasonably estimate returns if we do not continue to demonstrate our ability to estimate returns then our revenue recognition policy for these types of sales may no longer be appropriate we also offer customer rebates as part of our selling efforts and establish reserves for payment of rebates historically a percentage of customers do not submit requests for their rebates if a greater number of eligible customers seek rebates than for which we have provided reserves our margins will be adversely affected for example if rebate redemptions for our quickbooks turbotax and quicken products were to increase by 1 it would result in a decrease of approximately 1 million in our revenue our insurance policies are costly may be inadequate and potentially expose us to unrecoverable risks insurance availability coverage terms and pricing continue to vary with market conditions we endeavor to obtain appropriate insurance coverage for insurable risks that we identify however we may fail to correctly anticipate or quantify insurable risks we may not be able to obtain appropriate insurance coverage and insurers may not respond as we intend to cover insurable events that may occur we have observed rapidly changing conditions in the insurance markets relating to nearly all areas of traditional corporate insurance such conditions have resulted in higher premium costs higher policy deductibles and lower coverage limits for some risks because of cost or availability the company does not have insurance coverage for these reasons the company is retaining a greater portion of its insurable risks than it has in the past at relatively greater cost if we are required to account for options under our employee stock plans as a compensation expense it would significantly reduce our net income and earnings per share although we are not currently required to record any compensation expense in connection with option grants to employees that have an exercise price at or above fair market value it is possible that future accounting pronouncements will require us to treat all employee stock options as a compensation expense the increased compensation expense would significantly reduce our net income and earnings per share under generally accepted accounting principles we are frequently a party to litigation that is costly to defend and is a distraction to our business due to our financial position and the large number of customers that we serve we are often forced to defend litigation for example we are currently being sued in three actions for claims related to our election to stop supporting certain of our older product offerings although we believe that these cases have no merit and we are defending the matters vigorously defending such matters is distracting to management and expensive for intuit although we often seek insurance coverage for litigation defense costs there is no assurance that our defense costs which can be substantial will be covered in all cases in addition by its nature litigation is unpredictable and we may not prevail even in cases where we strongly believe a plaintiff’s case has no valid claims if we do not prevail in litigation we may be required to pay substantial monetary damages or alter our business operations regardless of the outcome litigation is expensive and distracting and may reduce our income unanticipated changes in our tax rates could affect our future results our future effective tax rates could be favorably or unfavorably affected by unanticipated changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or by changes in tax laws or their interpretation in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on its operating results and financial condition 47 

our stock price may be volatile our stock has at times experienced substantial price volatility as a result of variations between our actual and anticipated financial results and as a result of our announcements and those of our competitors in addition the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies in ways that have been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies these factors as well as general economic and political conditions may materially adversely affect the market price of our stock in the future if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls we may not be able to detect fraud or report our financial results accurately which could harm our business and the trading price of our common stock effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and to detect and prevent fraud we periodically assess our system of internal controls and the internal controls of service providers upon which we rely to review their effectiveness and identify potential areas of improvement these assessments may conclude that enhancements modifications or changes to our system of internal controls are necessary in addition from time to time we acquire businesses many of which have limited infrastructure and systems of internal controls performing assessments of internal controls implementing necessary changes and maintaining an effective internal controls process is expensive and requires considerable management attention particularly in the case of newly acquired entities internal control systems are designed in part upon assumptions about the likelihood of future events and all such systems however well designed and operated can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance that the objectives of the system are met because of these and other inherent limitations of control systems there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions regardless of how remote if we fail to implement and maintain an effective system of internal controls or prevent fraud we could suffer losses could be subject to costly litigation investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information and our brand and operating results could be harmed which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock we must comply with recently enacted legislation known as sox 404 specifically we and our independent registered public accounting firm must certify the adequacy of our internal controls over financial reporting at july 31 2005 identification of material weaknesses in internal controls over financial reporting by us or our independent registered public accounting firm could adversely affect our competitive position in our business especially our outsourced payroll business and the market price for our common stock business interruptions could adversely affect our future operating results several of our major business operations are subject to interruption by earthquake fire power shortages terrorist attacks and other hostile acts and other events beyond our control the majority of our research and development activities our corporate headquarters our principal information technology systems and other critical business operations are located near major seismic faults we do not carry earthquake insurance for direct quakerelated losses our operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake or other natural or manmade disaster caution regarding forwardlooking statements this report contains forwardlooking statements these forwardlooking statements include our statements regarding the following our belief that we can deliver solid revenue and profit growth our expectations regarding our product development efforts noted in the last paragraph of the section entitled “product development” our belief that our distributor relationships will increase growth opportunities in our higherend offerings our belief that our current real estate leases are sufficient to meet our current and nearterm needs our expectations regarding our use of cash generated in our business the assumptions underlying our critical accounting policies including our estimates regarding product rebate and return reserves our belief that revenue growth for our products is slowing due to market maturation our plans to mitigate slowing revenue by developing and introducing new products and services our plan to sell our intuit public sector solutions business our belief that our income tax valuation allowance is sufficient our expectation that we may use cash for future acquisitions of technology and businesses 48 

and our expectation that our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for the next 12 months we caution investors that forwardlooking statements are only predictions based on our current expectations about future events and are not guarantees of future performance our actual results performance or achievements could differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forwardlooking statements due to risks uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict these risks and uncertainties include the following the impact of intense competition in our business difficulty in developing and introducing new products and services effectively failure of customers to adopt our new products as expected difficulties with suppliers and distribution channels challenges associated with upgrading and integrating our information systems unanticipated increases in customer rebate and return rates significant impairment charges due to past acquisitions we may be unable to sell our intuit public sector solutions business and taxing authorities may challenge our tax positions in addition the risks and uncertainties that are discussed in this item 7 under the caption “risks that could affect future results” may also impact these forwardlooking statements we encourage you to read that section carefully along with the other information provided in this report and in our other filings with the sec before deciding to invest in our stock or to maintain or change your investment we undertake no obligation to revise or update any forwardlooking statement for any reason except as required by law 49 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk shortterm investment portfolio we do not hold derivative financial instruments in our portfolio of shortterm investments and funds held for payroll customers our shortterm investments and funds held for payroll customers consist of instruments that meet quality standards consistent with our investment policy this policy specifies that except for direct obligations of the united states government securities issued by agencies of the united states government and money market or cash management funds we diversify our holdings by limiting our shortterm investments and funds held for payroll customers with any individual issuer the following table presents our portfolio of cash equivalents and shortterm investments at july 31 2004 by stated maturity the table is classified by the original maturity date listed on the security and includes cash equivalents and shortterm investments that are part of funds held for payroll customers on our balance sheet as of july 31 2004 the interest rate earned on our money market accounts is 090 and the interest rate earned on our shortterm investments is 122  

interest rate risk our cash equivalents and our portfolio of shortterm investments and funds held for payroll customers are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates interest rate movements affect the interest income we earn on cash equivalents shortterm investments and funds held for payroll customers and the value of those investments should interest rates increase by 10 from the levels of july 31 2004 the value of our shortterm investments and funds held for payroll customers would decline by approximately 09 million should interest rates increase by 100 basis points from the levels of july 31 2004 the value of our shortterm investments and funds held for payroll customers would decline by approximately 59 million impact of foreign currency rate changes since we translate foreign currencies primarily canadian dollars and british pounds into us dollars for financial reporting purposes currency fluctuations can have an impact on our financial results the historical impact of currency fluctuations has generally been immaterial we believe that our exposure to currency exchange fluctuation risk is not significant primarily because our global subsidiaries invoice customers and satisfy their financial obligations almost exclusively in their local currencies there was a nominal currency exchange impact from our intercompany transactions for fiscal 2002 due primarily to the effect of the weakening us dollar on intercompany balances with our canadian subsidiary we recorded foreign currency exchange gains of 54 million in fiscal 2003 and 31 million in fiscal 2004 although the impact of currency fluctuations on our financial results has generally been immaterial in the past and we believe that for the reasons cited above currency fluctuations will not be significant in the future there can be no guarantee that the impact of currency fluctuations will not be material in the future as of july 31 2004 we did not engage in foreign currency hedging activities 50

products in australia new zealand and singapore through a development marketing and distribution arrangement with australiabased reckon limited product development historically our desktop software products have tended to have a fairly predictable structured development cycle of about a year with annual product releases this trend has been changing for our small business desktop products we now supplement annual releases of our core quickbooks products with periodic releases of quickbooks products for larger or more complex businesses and for our industryspecific quickbooks products the development timing for our service offerings such as outsourced payroll is determined by business needs and regulatory requirements and the length of the development cycle depends on the scope and complexity of each particular project developing tax preparation software presents unique challenges because of the demanding development cycle required to accurately incorporate annual tax law and tax form changes within a rigid timetable the product development cycles for our vertical business management solutions businesses are sometimes longer than one year for major product releases for a description of other risks and challenges we face relating to our product development see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — risks that could affect future results” during the past few years we have devoted significant resources to developing new products and services including quickbooks premier quickbooks premier accountant edition quickbooks enterprise solutions business management software industryspecific versions of quickbooks the intuit developer network turbotax premier the instant data entry feature of our turbotax products and services and quicken premier we supplement our internal development efforts by acquiring strategically important products and technology from third parties or establishing other relationships that enable us to expand our offerings more rapidly for example during fiscal 2002 we acquired four companies that provide business management products in selected vertical industries and we worked closely with a thirdparty technology provider to develop our quickbooks point of sale software in fiscal 2003 we acquired the technology assets underlying this software from the same provider in fiscal 2003 we also acquired blue ocean software a company with a product that helps businesses manage their information technology resources and assets and we formed a strategic alliance with a thirdparty database company that allows us to use their data management and synchronization package in our future research and development we also devote resources to improving our existing products and services for our desktop software products our recent development efforts have focused on creating an easier more seamless endtoend customer experience as well as adding new features for example in fiscal 2003 our turbotax product development team invested significant resources in improving areas of the product that customers told us weren’t easy to use or resulted in customer support contacts we also continue to incorporate technology in our products and services to address customer concerns about privacy and security while minimizing the impact on performance and ease of use in addition in recent years we have developed technology that helps reduce unlicensed use of some of our desktop software products our quickbooks products require registration after an initial trial period and our professional tax return preparation products and our canadian consumer tax products contain technology that restricts sharing of 9 those products we have also developed technology to unlock marketing and trial versions of many of our us products such as turbotax mycd during the past few years we have made a number of improvements to our product development process we team technical support and product development personnel so that we can anticipate feature usability and support issues early in the development process in fiscal 2003 the quickbooks product development team deployed a rigorous process to build customer requirements into the development and beta processes quickbooks 2003 continued to evolve during the year through a regular update and release cycle that further integrated customer suggestions this iterative process improved product quality and reduced customer service and technical support call volume for our quickbooks 2003 products other significant product development process improvements include the adoption of formal software inspections in several of our large development groups the introduction of an enhanced software change management process to the tax software product development organizations and the institutionalization of software architecture as a discipline in all major software development groups these changes and others such as automating our quality assurance testing and providing electronic updates to our beta test customers have allowed us to shorten our development cycles and launch more new products more quickly our research and development expenses were 1961 million in fiscal 2001 1985 million in fiscal 2002 and 2558 million in fiscal 2003 over the next few years we expect that we will be faced with somewhat different product development challenges than we have in the past we will be developing more versions of more complex products than ever before in addition these products will offer increased ease of use be customized for specific customer needs and feature improved integration with other intuit products and services and with our internal information support systems our research and development efforts will be focused on developing new products and services to address customer needs in our more broadly defined market segments as well as adding complementary products and services to drive additional recurring revenue from our core products we strive to maintain a balance between relatively lowrisk investments that address existing customer needs and investments in more innovative but higherrisk projects with potentially greater returns marketing sales and distribution markets during the past two years we have expanded both the markets that we serve and the products and services that we offer in our target markets historically our target markets were individuals and small businesses with less than 20 employees we continue to serve those markets with products and services such as quickbooks turbotax and quicken in addition to these markets we are now targeting small businesses with up to 250 employees we are addressing this new customer segment with a number of new products and services under the umbrella of our right for my business strategy we are introducing accounting solutions to meet the specialized requirements of certain small businesses by developing industryspecific versions of quickbooks which we call “flavors” we have introduced new premier and enterprise versions of quickbooks for companies that due to their larger size or complexity have more demanding accounting needs we have also introduced business solutions that go beyond accounting software to address a wider range of business management challenges that small businesses face in addition we have acquired companies that offer robust business management solutions to a wide range of businesses in selected industries which we call “verticals” we expect to continue expanding in these directions over the next several years see “business overview — customerfocused product strategy” and “products and services” above for more details about our product and service offerings many of the markets in which we compete are characterized by rapidly changing customer demands continuous technological changes and improvements shifting industry standards and frequent new product introductions by competitors market and industry changes can quickly render existing products and services obsolete so our success depends on our ability to respond rapidly to these changes with new business models updated competitive strategies new or enhanced products and services alternative distribution methods and other changes to the way we do business for a description of other risks and challenges we face relating to marketing sales and distribution see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — risks that could affect future results” 10 distribution channels over the past two years we have been broadening our distribution channels to accommodate the recent expansion of the markets we serve and the range of products and services we offer our goal is to make our products and services available in a variety of ways so that each customer may choose the channel that best meets that customer’s needs direct marketing programs for our core desktop software products quickbooks turbotax and quicken we use various types of direct marketing campaigns — including mail email and telephone solicitations directresponse newspaper and magazine advertising and television and radio advertising — to generate software orders stimulate demand and generally maintain and increase consumer awareness of our products we also use workflowintegrated inproduct messaging in several of our software products to market our other related products and services in addition we have recently initiated new direct marketing programs in which we ship certain software products directly to customers without charge customers electronically unlock and pay for the products when they are ready to use them direct marketing campaigns are one of the most effective ways to encourage existing customers to purchase additional products and services including software upgrades direct sales channel our direct sales efforts have historically focused on generating sales of relatively inexpensive offtheshelf products to existing customers through call centers our service offerings such as intuit payroll services complete payroll as well as our more sophisticated higherpriced software products require a different approach to direct sales than our traditional desktop software as we have expanded our service offerings and introduced more highend software products and business management solutions over the past two years we have been enhancing our direct sales capabilities to support revenue growth in these new areas as well as in our core desktop software we are investing in technology to consolidate and improve our management of customer contact data and order management tools across business divisions and we are training our customer service personnel in consultative selling techniques we have expanded our direct sales staff and broadened its role to include more extensive and personalized contact with existing and potential customers in addition the products and services we offer through our vertical business management solutions segment are sold primarily through direct sales organizations as a result of all of these factors we expect that direct sales will become an increasingly important source of revenue and will increase our selling and marketing expenses over the next few years many of our direct customers choose to order andor take delivery of products electronically through our web sites electronic ordering and delivery are generally more convenient for customers and more costefficient for intuit electronic delivery is available for most of our tax preparation products and for all product updates for our tax preparation products retail distribution channel we market our quickbooks turbotax and quicken desktop software at retail in north america primarily through traditional retail software outlets computer superstores office supply superstores food and drug retailers warehouse clubs and general mass merchandisers in international markets we also rely on distributors valueadded resellers and other third parties who sell products into the retail channel we will continue to evaluate new retail distribution channels as appropriate for reaching our customers in the future we continue to benefit from strong relationships with a number of major north american retailers which allows us to minimize our dependence on any specific retailer we now ship most of our products directly to the individual store locations of these major retailers and use distributors only to reach smaller retailers see “manufacturing and distribution” we continue to aggressively manage our inventory to optimize instock presence and ensure good product placement within retail stores in response to current retail trends we are also placing a greater proportion of inventory with retailers on a consignment basis see “competition” and “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — risks that could affect future results” as we execute on our right for my business strategy we are starting to offer software products that are more complex and have higher prices than our traditional retail software products our recent tailoring of some of these software products to specific customer needs including industryspecific versions of quickbooks is also resulting in a greater number of intuit products we produce and place instore displays and other retail merchandising aids 11 that educate customers about product functionality and benefits however we continue to evaluate whether the retail channel will be an effective distribution model for some of these higherend offerings see “competition” and “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — risks that could affect future results” oem channel we have existing relationships with a number of personal computer “original equipment manufacturers” or oems including apple computer inc dell computer corporation gateway inc and hewlettpackard which enable us to generate sales of our core desktop software products in two ways first certain oems “prebundle” newuser versions of certain desktop software products on the computer systems that the oems sell to their customers these prebundled oem sales are a good source of new customers and future revenues the second source of revenue from the oem channel is “aftermarket” programs in which customers who are purchasing computers can select and purchase software products at the same time thirdparty “valueadded” distribution arrangements as we execute on our right for my business strategy we are supplementing our direct sales capabilities and our retail and oem distribution relationships with selected thirdparty distribution arrangements we believe these relationships will enhance the growth opportunities for our higherend product and service offerings by allowing us to benefit from the valueadded marketing and sales expertise of these third parties we currently have arrangements with third parties who have specialized expertise in marketing selling and providing postsale implementation services for some of our vertical business management solutions businesses during fiscal 2004 and beyond we expect to continue to optimize and support our network of thirdparty relationships to help increase revenue for some of our existing higherend products and services as well as for additional products and services we anticipate offering as we execute our right for my business strategy competition overview we face intense competition in almost all of our businesses both domestically and globally competitive interest and expertise in many of the markets we serve particularly small business and consumer tax has grown markedly over the past few years and we expect this trend to continue some of our existing competitors have significantly greater financial technical and marketing resources than we do as we implement our customerfocused strategies we face increased competitive threats from larger companies in more diverse markets than we have historically faced in addition the competitive landscape can shift rapidly as new companies enter markets in which we compete see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — risks that could affect future results” for our quickbooks turbotax and quicken desktop software we believe the most important competitive factors are product features ease of use size of the installed customer base brand name recognition price product and support quality and access to distribution channels we believe we compete effectively on these factors as our three principal desktop software products are the leading products in the retail sales channel for their respective categories for most of our products and services other than desktop software we believe the most important competitive factors are features and ease of use brand name recognition speed in getting new products and services to market the ability to distribute them effectively through online methods or through retailers third party resellers and direct distribution and quality of implementation and support for our service offerings such as outsourced payroll service reliability and scalability of operations are also important factors we believe we compete effectively on these factors our most obvious competition comes from other companies that offer technology solutions similar to ours these competitors are described below however for many of our products and services other important competitive alternatives for customers are manual tools and processes or generalpurpose software many of our new customers have used pencil and paper or software such as word processors and spreadsheets rather than competitors’ software and services to perform financial tasks for example many taxpayers prepared their tax returns manually before using turbotax a large number of small businesses used spreadsheets to keep their books and they processed their payroll using spreadsheets and manuallywritten checks before purchasing quickbooks and most of our personal finance customers tracked their finances with spreadsheets manually or not at all before using quicken 12 quickbooks and small business products and services competitors for our small business accounting and business management offerings include companies such as bestpeachtree software which is owned by the sage group plc microsoft corporation and myob group microsoft has several small business offerings that compete with our small business offerings including microsoft business solutions small business manager microsoft busines solutions crm and business contact manager for microsoft office outlook® 2003 we expect that microsoft small business offerings will continue to compete with our small business offerings perhaps even more directly in the future as we expand the depth and breadth of our small business offerings we face competition from companies that are already offering industryspecific small business solutions and business management tools and services for larger small businesses in addition to established competitors other potential competitors have expressed significant interest in providing accounting and other products and services to small businesses our payroll services compete directly with traditional payroll service providers as well as webbased service providers significant competitive factors include distribution channels and a highly fragmented market including financial institutions that are developing or promoting their own payroll services we face direct competition in our intuit payroll services complete payroll business from traditional payroll services offered by a number of companies including adp and paychex as well as hundreds of regional and local companies our quickbooks assisted payroll service competes directly with companies offering webbased payroll services and indirectly with companies offering other payroll solutions various companies also offer tax table subscription and electronic filing services similar to our quickbooks doityourself payroll offering our financial supplies business competes with a number of business forms companies including new england business service and deluxe business systems as well as with printing services offered by franchises such as kinko’s and large office supply retailers such as office depot and staples other competitors include direct mail check printers banks and a number of smallerscale internetbased printing companies in addition our quickbooks products include some features such as customizable invoicing and 1099 tax form printing that compete with our supplies products online bill payment services and online payroll services with direct deposit capabilities also offer competitive alternatives to printed checks significant competitive factors for the supplies business include ordering convenience methods of reaching customers product quality speed of delivery and price we believe that our convenient access to our large quickbooks and quicken customer bases is a significant competitive advantage for our financial supplies business consumer tax competition in the consumer tax preparation market is intense our major domestic competitor for both desktop and webbased consumer tax software continues to be hr block the makers of taxcut software in addition a number of smaller competitors have entered the online consumer tax preparation market segment and other larger competitors may enter both the desktop and webbased consumer tax market segments in the future our consumer tax products and services also compete for customers with professional tax preparers particularly those with franchise operations and including those who use our professional tax return preparation software we also face potential competitive challenges from publicly funded government entities that offer electronic tax preparation and filing services at no cost to individual taxpayers the federal government signed a threeyear agreement with the free file alliance in october 2002 under which a number of private sector companies rather than the federal government are providing webbased federal tax preparation and filing services at no cost through voluntary public service initiatives such as our intuit tax freedom project as a member of the free file alliance we continue to actively work with others in the public sector to advance the goals of the free file alliance program and to support a successful publicprivate partnership however future administrative regulatory or legislative activity in this area could adversely affect us see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — risks that could affect future results” professional accounting solutions the professional accounting solutions and tax preparation software market segment has many competitors our largest competitors in the united states are cch incorporated with its prosystem fx product line kleinrock 13 publishing with its atx product line and the thomson corporation with its creative solutions and gosystem offerings we also have many smaller competitors in this market segment the professional tax market has been highly fragmented in the past but it has experienced some consolidation in recent years vertical business management solutions all of our vertical business management solutions businesses operate in highly competitive and fragmented environments where no competitor has a significant share of the market segment we may experience pricing pressure in these market segments because we compete with many small companies who have fewer resources than larger companies and are therefore more likely to focus on nearterm sales in each of these market segments the possibility exists that through either consolidation within the market segment or the entry into the market segment of new companies a significant competitor will emerge other businesses in desktop personal finance software the microsoft money product is our primary domestic competition we also face competition from webbased personal finance tracking and management tools that are available at no cost to consumers through financial institutions and others there are many competitors for our other personal finance products and services some portal web sites and financial institutions also provide offerings such as webbased bill presentment and payment services that compete with services we offer in canada we face competition from a number of companies in the small business arena including computer associates international inc and microsoft corporation competitors for our canadian consumer tax business include online consumer tax products from a number of companies including ufile as well as tax preparation services from companies such as hr block and liberty tax the primary competitor for our professional tax business in canada is cch canadian limited in europe we face competition from bhuldata wiso microsoft and the sage group plc based in the united kingdom in the small business market as well as competition from various webbased accounting products our primary global competitor in the personal finance arena is microsoft customer service and technical support we provide customer service and technical support by telephone online chat fax email and our customer service and technical support web sites we have fulltime and outsourced customer service and technical support staffs which we supplement with seasonal employees and additional outsourcing during periods of peak call volumes such as during the tax return filing season or following a major product launch during the past few years we have focused on developing support capabilities that can supplement or in some situations replace telephone service and support for example customers can use our web sites to find answers to commonly asked questions check on the status of product orders and receive product updates electronically alternative service and support methods are less expensive for us and are often more efficient and effective for our customers we have completed a number of process excellence projects in our customer service and technical support operations to improve our call capacity forecasting develop more flexible approaches to staffing and reduce support call volumes and handling times we have also outsourced a portion of the growth in our customer service and technical support operations to several firms located in the united states as well as to firms located outside the united states including india and northern ireland we expect to continue to outsource a portion of those operations in the future we believe that both these process improvement and outsourcing projects are critical to our ongoing efforts to provide better service to customers at the same or lower cost we generally charge customers for technical support but we do not charge for installation problems or product defect issues we offer free selfhelp information through our technical support web sites for our main product lines support alternatives and fees vary widely by product from selfhelp to online chat to telephone support our customers can generally choose from a range of support options that are priced based on the level of personal assistance and response time they require our vertical business management solutions businesses also offer product consulting and training services 14 despite our efforts to maintain continuous and reliable customer service and technical support operations we risk losing service at any one of our customer contact centers and our redundancy systems could prove inadequate to provide backup support see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — risks that could affect future results” for additional information about our customer service and technical support operations manufacturing and distribution desktop software the major steps involved in manufacturing desktop software are duplicating cds printing boxes and related materials and assembling and shipping the final products we have a manufacturing agreement with modus media international inc under which modus provides substantially all outsourced manufacturing related to our retail launches of quickbooks turbotax and quicken as well as for daytoday retail order fulfillment after product launches although modus has operations in multiple locations that can provide redundancy if necessary we are in the process of centralizing the manufacturing for our retail products in one of their facilities which is colocated with our primary retail fulfillment vendor ingram micro logistics we expect this arrangement to result in lower manufacturing costs and shorter manufacturing cycle times during fiscal 2003 we also had an inhouse facility that handled the manufacturing and shipping for most direct sales orders in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 we signed an agreement with arvato services inc a subsidiary of bertelsmann to outsource our direct product manufacturing and distribution we expect this arrangement to result in expanded capabilities service improvements and lower manufacturing and distribution costs we anticipate that the transition to arvato will be complete by the end of october 2003 we have multiple sources for all of our raw materials and availability has historically not been a problem for us over the past few years we have taken steps to streamline our packaging and reduce our inventory and scrap costs in order to generate greater profitability in our core desktop software businesses our retail product launches have become operationally more complex over the past few years we have evolved from shipping to a few hundred distribution centers with distributors delivering products to individual retail locations to a “direct to storefront” model in which we ship products directly to approximately 10000 individual retail locations this allows us to be more responsive to the needs of our retail accounts we have an agreement with ingram micro logistics under which ingram handles all logistics fulfillment and similar functions for our retail sales in support of this direct to storefront initiative during the past two years we have improved operational rigor at various points in our supply chain as a result we have significantly increased our ontime shipments and significantly reduced our aggregate channel inventory levels we have also reduced our dependence on distributors or on any individual retail account no distributor or retailer accounted for 10 or more of our total net revenue during fiscal 2001 2002 or 2003 prior to major product releases we tend to have significant levels of backlog but at other times backlog is minimal and we normally ship products within a few days of receiving an order because of this fluctuation in backlog we believe that backlog is not a reliable predictor of our future desktop software sales internetbased products and services intuit’s data centers house most of the systems networks and databases required to operate and deliver our internetbased products and services including quickbooks online edition quickbooks assisted payroll service turbotax for the web electronic tax filing and quickencom through our data centers we connect customers to products and services and we store the vast amount of data that represents the content on our web sites our data centers consist of approximately 3000 servers and 500 databases located in several sites across the united states in an effort to reduce unavailability or “down time” for our internetbased products and services we generally follow industrystandard practices for creating a faulttolerant environment but we do not have complete redundancy we also have a major initiative underway to provide backup processing capabilities that are designed to protect us 15 against siterelated disasters despite our efforts to maintain continuous and reliable server operations we occasionally experience unplanned outages or technical difficulties see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — risks that could affect future results” privacy and security of customer information customers are concerned about the privacy and security of the personal information they provide to companies this concern applies to information they provide in connection with internetbased products and services as well as information they provide through more traditional methods such as product registration cards in addition to customer concerns we are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations relating to privacy and security we are also subject to laws and regulations that apply to telemarketing activities additional laws in both areas are likely to be passed in the future which could result in significant limitations on the ways in which we can communicate with our customers and significantly increase our compliance costs see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — risks that could affect future results” we have established guidelines and practices to help ensure that customers are aware of and can control how we use information about them all publiclyaccessible intuitowned and operated consumer web sites at which customer data is collected including quickbookscom turbotaxcom and quickencom have been certified by truste an independent nonprofit privacy organization that operates a web site certification program to alleviate users’ concerns about online privacy each of our web sites as well as our software products has a privacy statement providing notice to customers of our privacy practices as well as providing them the opportunity to furnish instructions with respect to use of their data to address security concerns we use industrystandard security safeguards to help protect the information customers give to us from loss misuse and unauthorized alteration whenever customers transmit sensitive information such as a credit card number or tax return data to us through our web site we provide them access to our servers that allow encryption of the information as it is transmitted to us we work to protect personally identifiable information stored on the web site’s servers from unauthorized access using commercially available computer security products such as firewalls as well as internally developed security procedures and practices we believe privacy and security issues pose a significant risk to intuit and other companies especially companies doing business over the internet although we have made significant efforts to address customer concerns through our business practices during the past few years we have faced lawsuits and negative publicity relating to privacy issues our response to these allegations has been that we do not share any personally identifiable information except as disclosed in our privacy policies a major breach of customer privacy or security even by another company could have serious consequences for our businesses see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — risks that could affect future results” and “legal proceedings” government regulation we offer certain products and services such as our payroll offerings which are subject to special regulatory requirements as we expand our small business offerings we may become subject to additional government regulation particularly in the areas of retirement planning and other employer services we continually analyze new business opportunities and new businesses that we pursue may require additional costs for regulatory compliance current government regulation poses a number of risks to us including potential liability to customers andor penalties and sanctions by government regulators future regulation could hamper the growth of our businesses see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — risks that could affect future results” 16 intellectual property we rely on a combination of copyright patent trademark and trade secret laws and employee and thirdparty nondisclosure and license agreements to protect our software products and other proprietary technology we do not own all of the software and other technologies used in our products and services but we have the licenses from third parties that we believe are necessary and appropriate for using that technology in our current products we consider our principal trademarks including intuit quickbooks turbotax and quicken to be important assets and have registered these and other trademarks and service marks in the united states and many foreign countries the initial duration of trademark registrations varies from country to country and is 10 years in the united states most registrations can be renewed perpetually at 10year intervals we face a number of risks relating to our intellectual property including persistent piracy of our desktop software products through unauthorized use and copying although we continue to evaluate technology solutions to piracy as well as increase our civil and criminal enforcements efforts we expect piracy to be a persistent problem we also face the risk of third parties claiming that our products or services infringe their intellectual property rights and we face risks to the value of our brands when we grant trademark licenses to third parties see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — risks that could affect future results” employees as of august 31 2003 we had approximately 6700 employees located primarily in the united states canada and the united kingdom we believe our future success and growth will depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees in all areas of our business we do not currently have any collective bargaining agreements with our employees and we believe employee relations are generally good although we have employmentrelated agreements with a number of key employees these agreements do not guarantee continued service we believe we offer competitive compensation and a good working environment we were selected as one of fortune magazine’s “100 best companies to work for” in april 2002 and 2003 however we face intense competition for qualified employees and we expect to face continuing challenges in recruiting and retention

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations note for a more complete understanding of our financial condition and results of operations and some of the risks that could affect future results see “risks that could affect future results” in this item 7 this section should also be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes in item 8 as discussed below we sold our quicken loans mortgage business in july 2002 and our japanese subsidiary intuit kk in february 2003 and accounted for the sales of these businesses as discontinued operations accordingly we have reclassified our financial statements for all periods prior to the sales to reflect these businesses as discontinued operations unless otherwise noted the following discussion pertains only to our continuing operations results of operations the following table shows trends in our total net revenue and net income loss for the past three fiscal years  nm is a nonmeaningful comparison overview intuit’s mission our mission is to transform the way people run their businesses and manage their financial lives our products and services fall into the following principal categories quickbooks® small business accounting and business management solutions small business products and services that include payroll financial supplies technical support and information technology management solutions turbotax® consumer tax products and services proseries® and lacerte® professional tax products and services intuitbranded business management solutions designed to meet the specialized requirements of businesses in selected industries which we call “verticals” and our other businesses which consist primarily of quicken® personal finance products and services and our canadian business see “ net revenue ” below and note 11 of the financial statements for more information about our business segments expanding product and service offerings during the last year we have expanded the number and complexity of the products and services that we offer under our right for my business strategy we are introducing solutions to meet the specialized requirements of certain small businesses by developing industryspecific versions of quickbooks which we call “flavors” we have introduced new versions of quickbooks for companies that due to their larger size or complexity have more demanding accounting needs we have also introduced business solutions that go beyond accounting software to address a wider range of business management challenges that small businesses face in addition we are acquiring companies that offer robust business management solutions to businesses in selected vertical industries we expect to continue to expand in these directions over the next several years evolving distribution channels we have been expanding our distribution channels to accommodate the expansion of the markets we serve and the range of products and services we offer our target customers in the retail channel we are selling an increasing proportion of our software products directly to a variety of retailers rather than through a few major distributors as we offer software products that are more complex and higher priced than our traditional retail software products we expect that direct sales will become an increasingly important source of revenue and new customers finally as we add products and services that are complementary to our core products we are focusing on strengthening our crossselling capabilities we expect that these increased capabilities will allow us to generate additional revenue from our existing customers particularly our small business customers 25 seasonality our tax businesses and to a lesser extent our small business products and services are highly seasonal sales of tax preparation products and services are heavily concentrated in the period from november through april these seasonal patterns mean that our total net revenue is usually highest during our second and third quarters ending january 31 and april 30 since fiscal 2000 we have recognized an increasing portion of our consumer tax annual revenue during the third quarter compared to the second quarter and that trend continued during fiscal 2003 we typically report losses in our first and fourth quarters ending october 31 and july 31 when revenue from our tax businesses is minimal while operating expenses to develop new products and services continue at relatively consistent levels impact of acquisitions our acquisitions of businesses and assets have affected the comparability of our results during the past three fiscal years we have completed several acquisitions which have affected the comparability of revenue and operating results for those years the amortization and impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets we have acquired in connection with acquisitions has also had a significant impact on our operating results and on the comparability of results for those years during fiscal 2001 and 2002 we recorded amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets and other acquisitionrelated charges of 2478 million and 1814 million which included impairment charges of 787 million and 220 million starting with the first quarter of fiscal 2003 we no longer amortize goodwill in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” as a result our acquisitionrelated charges decreased significantly during fiscal 2003 to 339 million there were no impairment charges in fiscal 2003 it is possible that in the future we may incur impairment charges related to existing goodwill as well as to goodwill arising out of future acquisitions at july 31 2003 we had 5911 million in goodwill and 1254 million in intangible assets on our balance sheet see notes 1 and 4 of the financial statements for more information regarding our goodwill and intangible assets and the impact of impairment charges on our reported net income or loss critical accounting policies in preparing our financial statements we make estimates assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on our net revenue operating income or loss and net income or loss as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our balance sheet we believe that the estimates assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies senior management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and their disclosure in this report with the audit committee of our board of directors  26  27  28 total net revenue the table below shows total net revenue and percentage of total net revenue for each of our business segments for fiscal years 2001 2002 and 2003 we have reclassified prior year financial information to conform to the current year presentation for comparability see note 11 of the financial statements for additional information about our business segments  29 fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 fiscal 2003 total net revenue of 16507 million represented a 26 increase over fiscal 2002 total net revenue the increase in net revenue was primarily due to growth of 35 in our small business products and services segment 24 in our quickbooks segment and 20 in our consumer tax segment our vertical business management solutions segment which is comprised primarily of companies we acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 contributed 948 million to net revenue compared to 142 million in fiscal 2002 net revenue for our professional accounting solutions segment also grew 8 net revenue for our other businesses segment increased only 2 due primarily to lack of growth in the personal finance desktop software category and continuing industrywide slowness in spending by purchasers of internet advertising fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 fiscal 2002 total net revenue of 13122 million represented an increase of 20 over fiscal 2001 total net revenue the increase in net revenue was primarily due to growth of 29 in our consumer tax segment 25 in our professional accounting solutions segment 19 in our quickbooks segment and 16 in our small business products and services segment other businesses net revenue was flat in fiscal 2002 reflecting a decrease in internet advertising revenue and lower sales of quicken due to the continuing overall decline in the personal finance desktop software category offset by growth in canada total net revenue by business segment the following net revenue discussion is categorized by our reportable business segments which reflect how we manage our operations and how our chief operating decision maker views results in fiscal 2003 we revised our reportable segments to reflect the way we currently manage and view our businesses we determined that the quickbooks product component of our fiscal 2002 small business segment was a separate reportable segment and we combined our fiscal 2002 employer services segment with the balance of small business to arrive at the fiscal 2003 segment called small business products and services we began reporting vertical business management solutions formerly small business verticals as a separate segment in fiscal 2003 finally we combined our fiscal 2002 personal finance and global business segments to arrive at the fiscal 2003 segment called other businesses we have reclassified previously reported fiscal 2002 and 2001 segment results to conform to the fiscal 2003 presentation see note 11 of the financial statements for additional information about our reportable segments quickbooks quickbooks product revenue is derived primarily from quickbooks desktop software products quickbooks service revenue is derived from quickbooks online edition fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 quickbooks total net revenue increased 24 in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 the revenue increase reflected higher unit sales as well as higher average selling prices driven by the introduction of certain higherpriced quickbooks products and a shift in revenue mix toward those products the products include quickbooks premier accountant edition for accounting professionals quickbooks enterprise solutions for businesses with up to 250 employees quickbooks point of sale for retail businesses and three industryspecific versions of quickbooks we launched these products at the end of fiscal 2002 and during fiscal 2003 as part of our right for my business strategy and they have significantly higher average selling prices than our original quickbooks basic and quickbooks pro products we expect to introduce additional versions of quickbooks in fiscal 2004 fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 quickbooks total net revenue increased 19 in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 the increase in quickbooks product revenue reflected higher average selling prices driven primarily by the november 2001 launch of our higherpriced quickbooks premier products as well as higher unit sales the volume increase was driven by strong upgrade sales which we believe were due in part to our decision to discontinue technical support and tax table services during calendar 2002 for customers using certain older versions of quickbooks we believe that the availability of a range of thirdparty offerings from the intuit developer network to quickbooks 2002 customers may also have contributed to the stronger upgrade sales 30 small business products and services small business products and services product revenue is comprised of quickbooks doityourself payroll which offers payroll tax tables forms and electronic tax payment and filing services on a subscription basis to small businesses that prepare their own payrolls financial supplies such as paper checks envelopes and invoices and information technology management software service revenue for this segment is derived primarily from outsourced payroll services and from quickbooks support plans other revenue for this segment consists primarily of royalties from small business online services and interest earned on customer payroll deposits fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 small business products and services total net revenue grew 35 in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 payroll product revenue increased due to growth in the customer base and higher average selling prices driven by price increases financial supplies product revenue increased slightly during the year outsourced payroll service revenue increased due in large part to our acquisition of cbs employer services inc in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 quickbooks support revenue grew due to an increase in the number of support plans sold and continued strength in the higherpriced support plans for higherend quickbooks products introduced in late fiscal 2002 and in fiscal 2003 finally our acquisition of intuit information technology solutions formerly blue ocean software inc in the first quarter of fiscal 2003 also contributed to revenue growth for this segment fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 small business products and services total net revenue increased 16 in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 payroll product revenue increased reflecting higher average selling prices and growth in the customer base financial supplies product revenue increased slightly during the year outsourced payroll service revenue increased reflecting growth in quickbooks assisted payroll service due to higher average selling prices and growth in the customer base higher premier payroll service revenue and revenue from our fourth quarter fiscal 2002 acquisition of cbs employer services inc fiscal 2002 service revenue growth in this segment also reflected strong results from quickbooks support plans in august 2001 we began offering several higherend support plans which resulted in significantly higher average selling prices that more than offset declines in volume compared to fiscal 2001 revenue growth in this segment was partially offset by a decline in quickbooks internet gateway other revenue consumer tax consumer tax product revenue is derived primarily from turbotax federal and state consumer desktop tax return preparation software consumer tax service revenue is derived primarily from turbotax for the web online tax return preparation services and consumer electronic filing services paid web units exclude tax filing units that we donate under the intuit tax freedom project fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 consumer tax total net revenue increased 20 in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 total paid federal units increased 12 over fiscal 2002 desktop revenue increased due to growth in paid federal units and higher average selling prices for federal tax offerings with enhanced functionality turbotax for the web revenue increased due to paid federal unit growth and higher average selling prices electronic filing revenue was up due to higher federal desktop unit sales and higher average state electronic filing prices fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 consumer tax total net revenue increased 29 in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 revenue from turbotax desktop products was up due primarily to higher average selling prices resulting from the introduction of a higherpriced premium product revenue from turbotax for the web was strong in fiscal 2002 reflecting a significant increase in the mix of higherend service offerings as well as 84 unit growth electronic filing units and revenue also contributed to the yearoveryear growth professional accounting solutions professional accounting solutions product revenue is derived primarily from proseries and lacerte professional tax preparation software products professional accounting solutions service revenue is derived primarily from electronic filing and training services 31 fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 total net revenue from our professional tax preparation products and services increased 8 in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 product revenue grew 9 in fiscal 2003 due to price increases related to product enhancements new customer acquisition initiatives and successful crosssell efforts to the existing tax client base renewal rates for our existing customer base remained strong during fiscal 2003 fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 total net revenue from our professional tax preparation products and services increased 25 in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 approximately 210 million or 47 of the growth compared to fiscal 2001 resulted from our acquisition of tax and accounting software corporation in april 2001 higher revenue from electronic filing services was also a significant factor in the increase in addition new customer acquisition and higher average selling prices for our proseries and lacerte unlimiteduse products contributed to the revenue growth renewal rates for our existing customer base remained strong during fiscal 2002 vertical business management solutions vertical business management solutions “vbms” revenue is derived from four businesses that we acquired in fiscal 2002 that provide business management solutions for companies in selected industries those businesses are intuit distribution management solutions whose intuit eclipse™ line of products and services offers business management software for the wholesale durable goods industry mri real estate solutions whose intuit mri line of products and services provides business management software solutions for commercial and residential property managers intuit construction business solutions whose intuit masterbuilder™ line of products and services provides business management solutions for the construction industry and intuit public sector solutions whose intuit fundware™ line of products and services offers accounting and business management software solutions for nonprofit organizations universities and government agencies vbms product revenue is derived from business management software for these vertical industries vbms service revenue consists primarily of technical support consulting and training services fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 our vertical businesses contributed 948 million in revenue for fiscal 2003 compared to 142 million in fiscal 2002 three of the four acquisitions were completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 as a result revenue from this segment was not significant in fiscal 2002 and consisted primarily of revenue generated by intuit construction business solutions which we acquired in the first quarter of fiscal 2002 other businesses other businesses consist primarily of personal finance and canada personal finance product revenue is derived primarily from quicken desktop software products personal finance service revenue is nominal while other revenue consists of fees from consumer online transactions and quickencom advertising revenue in canada product revenue is derived primarily from localized versions of quickbooks and quicken as well as quicktax and taxwiz consumer desktop tax return preparation software and profile professional tax preparation products service revenue in canada consists primarily of revenue from software maintenance contracts sold with quickbooks fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 other businesses total net revenue increased 2 in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 personal finance product revenue decreased due to lack of growth in the market for personal finance desktop software and slow consumer spending lower unit sales for all quicken products more than offset higher average selling prices for quicken premier and quicken home and business personal finance other revenue also decreased due to continuing slowness in internet advertising and our exit from certain online businesses in fiscal 2002 total net revenue from canada grew in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 due partially to slightly higher revenue from quicktax higher average selling prices and higher unit sales for this product were fueled by the second quarter fiscal 2003 introduction of right for me consumer tax products targeted at taxpayers who maintain home offices or who are preparing for retirement our new taxwiz consumer tax preparation software also contributed to fiscal 2003 revenue growth canadian quickbooks revenue for fiscal 2003 declined due to lack of growth in the software category and decreases in the level of inventory purchasing by retailers the impact of these trends was partially offset by the introduction of several right for my business versions of quickbooks in canada in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2003 32 fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 other businesses total net revenue was flat in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 personal finance total net revenue decreased due primarily to a decline in revenue from quicken desktop products and lower quickencom revenue solid growth in our online transactions business partially offset these declines the decrease in quicken revenue reflected the continuing overall decline in the personal finance desktop software category lower quickencom advertising revenue reflected the industrywide decline in spending by purchasers of internet advertising revenue from canada increased in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 this reflected strong tax season results for quicktax due in part to the preliminary success of our efforts to reduce unauthorized sharing of desktop software canadian consumer tax revenue growth was partially offset by modest revenue declines for quickbooks and quicken cost of revenue  there are four components of our cost of revenue 1 cost of product revenue which includes the direct cost of manufacturing and shipping our software products 2 cost of service revenue which reflects direct costs associated with providing services including data center costs relating to delivering internetbased services 3 cost of other revenue which includes costs associated with generating advertising and marketing and online transactions revenue and 4 amortization of purchased software which represents the cost of amortizing products we obtained through acquisitions over their useful lives fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 cost of product revenue as a percentage of product revenue decreased to 15 in fiscal 2003 from 16 in fiscal 2002 this was primarily due to strong sales of our new higherpriced quickbooks products which have higher margins per unit we also continued to improve the packaging design process for certain products and streamline some of our manufacturing processes during fiscal 2003 this enabled us to reduce the perunit materials manufacturing and shipping costs for our shrinkwrap software products we expect to implement further efficiencies in our manufacturing processes during fiscal 2004 we also expect that the mix shift toward our higherpriced highermargin quickbooks products will continue and that growth rates for our higherpriced quickbooks products will exceed those for our lowerpriced products cost of service revenue as a percentage of service revenue decreased to 35 in fiscal 2003 from 39 in fiscal 2002 this decrease was primarily attributable to the growth in our outsourced payroll business during fiscal 2003 as this business grows we are leveraging our historical investments in data center and other infrastructure to reduce the unit cost and improve the profitability of outsourced payroll services in addition starting in the third quarter of fiscal 2003 we no longer paid royalties to wells fargo bank for our premier payroll service although we now amortize the 292 million purchase price of the right to market to this customer base to cost of service revenue the amortization expense is less than the royalties that would have been incurred under the old agreement we expect continued growth in our outsourced payroll business and a full year of the lower amortization expense for our premier payroll service during fiscal 2004 33 cost of other revenue as a percentage of other revenue decreased to 30 in fiscal 2003 from 40 in fiscal 2002 in the first quarter of fiscal 2002 we moved a large number of servers that supported our quickencom web site from an external hosting company to our own data center and streamlined the infrastructure over time this led to decreased cost of other revenue for this business we recorded a 52 million impairment charge for intangible assets related to quickencom advertising revenue in the second quarter of fiscal 2002 adjusting for this impairment charge amortization of purchased software increased 66 million in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 the increase was a result of additional amortization for intangible assets we purchased in connection with the acquisitions we completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 and the first quarter of fiscal 2003 amortization of purchased software expense may increase in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 as a result of future acquisitions and impairment charges which are not possible to predict fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 cost of product revenue as a percentage of product revenue decreased to 16 in fiscal 2002 from 17 in fiscal 2001 we lowered our perunit materials manufacturing and shipping costs for our shrinkwrap software products resulting in significant cost savings these savings were nearly offset by increased costs associated with improving our product distribution function during the first quarter of fiscal 2002 we established a new thirdparty retail distribution relationship for our shrinkwrap software products this distribution relationship enabled us to ship a larger percentage of our products directly to individual retail stores and allowed us to provide inventory to our retail customers on a more timely basis by providing better service to our retailers we reduced product returns and related costs cost of service revenue as a percentage of service revenue decreased to 39 in fiscal 2002 from 50 in fiscal 2001 this decrease was attributable primarily to our payroll and webbased tax businesses which experienced significant revenue growth with relatively fixed cost bases in fiscal 2002 cost of other revenue as a percentage of other revenue increased to 40 in fiscal 2002 compared to 35 in fiscal 2001 this increase was primarily due to increased data center costs related to our personal finance segment’s online transaction business amortization of purchased software decreased 25 million in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 this reflected lower amortization expense in the second half of fiscal 2002 that resulted from a lower base of assets to be amortized this decline was partially offset by impairment charges for certain purchased software assets that were recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2002 which caused the decrease in the base of assets 34 operating expenses  nm is a nonmeaningful comparison customer service and technical support fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 customer service and technical support expenses were 11 of total net revenue in fiscal 2003 compared to 13 in fiscal 2002 we continued to increase our efficiency in fiscal 2003 by improving our utilization of internal customer service representatives and by outsourcing some of our seasonal call center capabilities we also increased the proportion of customer service and technical support we provide through less expensive methods such as web sites online chat email and other electronic means in fiscal 2003 we benefited from the fiscal 2002 implementation of a number of successful process excellence initiatives that reduced costs while maintaining or increasing service levels these benefits were partially offset by increased demand for customer service and technical support due to the increasing complexity of our products and to customer questions relating to product activation technology in turbotax desktop products we discontinued product activation in certain turbotax products after the 2002 tax season fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 customer service and technical support expenses were 13 of total net revenue in fiscal 2002 and 2001 we improved our efficiency in fiscal 2002 by increasing the proportion of customer service and technical support we provide through less expensive methods such as web sites online chat email and other electronic means we also implemented a number of successful process excellence initiatives that reduced costs while maintaining or increasing service levels however these benefits were offset by higher direct sales and support costs associated with converting the customers of tax accounting and software company a company that we acquired in april 2001 to our proseries and lacerte professional tax products and by increased demand for customer service and technical support due to our growing customer base 35 selling and marketing fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 selling and marketing expenses were 20 of total net revenue in fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2002 in fiscal 2003 we continued to expand our small business marketing programs to support the right for my business strategy announced in fiscal 2002 marketing expenses for certain new quickbooks products with advanced functionality totaled approximately 120 million in fiscal 2003 compared to about 20 million in marketing expenses for those products in fiscal 2002 marketing expenses for fiscal 2003 also increased compared to fiscal 2002 as we expanded marketing programs to support our consumer tax right for me strategy which we introduced during the 2002 tax season in addition we added selling and marketing expenses for the companies we acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 and the first quarter of fiscal 2003 these increases were partially offset by a decrease in selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of total net revenue for our payroll business due to significant revenue growth in that segment fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 selling and marketing expenses were 20 of total net revenue in fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001 in fiscal 2002 selling and marketing expenses increased as we expanded our small business marketing programs to support the right for my business strategy announced in september 2001 we also incurred additional marketing expenses for our intuit construction business solutions products which we acquired in november 2001 these increases were partially offset by a decrease in selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of total net revenue for our payroll business due to significant revenue growth in that segment research and development fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 research and development expenses were 15 of total net revenue in fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2002 during fiscal 2003 we continued to invest in new products and enhanced functionality for existing products particularly those that support our small business right for my business and consumer tax right for me strategies we also added research and development expenses for the companies we acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 and the first quarter of fiscal 2003 offsetting these increases we continued to benefit from improvements in our development process that resulted in shorter development times and higher quality in many of our products fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 during fiscal 2002 we increased research and development spending in some of our highestgrowth businesses — quickbooks consumer tax and professional accounting solutions — by approximately 10 in particular we continued to invest in our right for my business strategy including new quickbooks premier enterprise and point of sale products launched in the second quarter of fiscal 2002 the intuit developer network and other new products that we expected to introduce in fiscal 2003 at the same time we significantly decreased or stopped spending in less strategic areas and discontinued product lines we also benefited from improvements in our development process that resulted in shorter development times and higher quality for our new quickbooks products the net result was that research and development expenses in fiscal 2002 declined as a percentage of total net revenue to 15 of total net revenue compared to 18 in fiscal 2001 general and administrative fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 general and administrative expenses were 9 of total net revenue in fiscal 2003 compared to 8 in fiscal 2002 general and administrative expenses increased in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 primarily due to acquisition integration costs the addition of general and administrative expenses for the companies we acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 and the first quarter of fiscal 2003 and higher insurance costs general and administrative expenses did not include labor costs capitalized in connection with internal use software projects of 180 million in fiscal 2003 and 129 million in fiscal 2002 fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 general and administrative expenses were 8 of total net revenue in fiscal 2002 compared to 9 in fiscal 2001 we experienced increased directors’ and officers’ liability insurance costs and costs associated with integrating our acquisitions of intuit construction business solutions formerly omware inc in november 2001 and employeematters inc in december 2000 these increases were partially offset by decreases in bad debt charges in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 36 charge for purchased research and development in connection with certain acquisitions and with the assistance of thirdparty appraisers we determine the value of inprocess projects under development for which technological feasibility has not been established the value of each project is determined by estimating the costs to develop the inprocess technology into a commercially feasible product estimating the net cash flows we believe would result from the product and discounting these net cash flows back to their present value the resulting amount is recorded as a charge for purchased research and development when we acquire certain new businesses in fiscal 2003 we recorded charges totaling 89 million for purchased research and development primarily in connection with our acquisition of blue ocean software inc now intuit information technology solutions in fiscal 2002 we recorded a charge of 22 million for purchased research

acquired tax accounting and software corporation charge for vacant facilities during the third quarter of fiscal 2002 we concluded that we would not occupy two vacant leased buildings in mountain view california and that we would be unable to recover a substantial portion of our lease obligations by subleasing the vacant space as a result we recorded a charge for vacant facilities of 132 million in that quarter during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 we decided that based on corporate growth requirements and the current real estate market in the san francisco bay area we would reoccupy one of these two vacant buildings as a result we reversed the remaining 19 million reserve for the related lease obligations to our statement of operations at the same time we added 14 million to the reserve for the remaining vacant mountain view building to reflect our revised estimate of future sublease income for that facility based on revised estimates we also reversed approximately 06 million in reserves related to various smaller facilities for a total credit for vacant facilities of 11 million to our statement of operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 see note 13 of the financial statements acquisitionrelated charges acquisitionrelated charges include the amortization of goodwill prior to august 1 2002 the amortization of purchased intangible assets and deferred compensation expenses arising from acquisitions and impairment charges relating to goodwill and purchased intangible assets beginning on august 1 2002 we no longer amortize goodwill due to our adoption of sfas 142 however it is possible that in the future we may incur impairment charges related to the goodwill already recorded and to goodwill arising out of future acquisitions see note 1 and note 4 of the financial statements fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 in fiscal 2003 acquisitionrelated charges were 339 million compared to 1814 million in fiscal 2002 in fiscal 2002 acquisitionrelated charges

the sale of our quicken bill manager business in may 2001 we acquired a 270 million longterm asset related to future consideration from princeton ecom see note 8 of the financial statements during fiscal 2002 events and circumstances indicated impairment of this asset these indicators included the deterioration of princeton ecom’s financial position and the decreased likelihood that it would receive future funding based on our analysis we determined that the fair value of this asset was impaired and recorded a charge of 270 million in fiscal 2002 to reduce its carrying value to zero nonoperating income and expenses interest and other income interest and other income was 387 million in fiscal 2003 compared to 273 million in fiscal 2002 and 576 million in fiscal 2001 fiscal 2003 interest and other income included 101 million in royalties from trademark license and distribution agreements that we entered into when we sold our mortgage business in july 2002 see note 9 of the financial statements due to the effect of the weakening us dollar on intercompany balances with our canadian subsidiary interest and other income also included foreign exchange gains of 54 million in fiscal 2003 compared to a nominal foreign exchange impact in fiscal 2002 in fiscal 2003 the interest income that we earned on our cash and shortterm investment balances decreased due in part to a continuing decline in market interest rates compared to the same periods of the prior year our interest income also decreased as a result of lower average cash and shortterm investment balances during part of fiscal 2003 compared to the same periods of fiscal 2002 due to our use of cash to fund our acquisitions and our stock repurchase programs see note 7 and note 15 of the financial statements the decrease in interest and other income during fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 was due to a sharp decline in the interest we earned on our cash and shortterm investment balances in fiscal 2002 reflecting significant decreases in market interest rates during the period interest earned on customer payroll deposits is reported as revenue for our payroll business and is not included in interest and other income gains losses on marketable securities and other investments net we recorded a pretax net gain relating to marketable securities and other investments of 109 million in fiscal 2003 we

agreement related to our quicken bill manager business which we sold in may 2001 we recorded a pretax gain of 83 million in connection with the termination of this agreement see note 8 of the financial statements during fiscal 2001 we recorded a pretax net loss of 153 million resulting from our divestitures of businesses we recorded a pretax loss of 169 million for the sale of the technology assets of our quicken bill manager business this loss was partially offset by a pretax gain of 16 million for the sale of certain assets of our wholly owned subsidiary intuit insurance services inc which operated our quicken insurance business see note 8 of the financial statements 38 income taxes for fiscal 2003 we recorded an income tax provision of 1296 million on pretax income

million resulting in an effective tax rate of approximately 9 our effective tax rate for fiscal 2003 differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to taxexempt interest income and research and development credits our effective tax rate for fiscal 2002 differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to a tax benefit related to a divestiture that became available during the year and taxexempt interest income offset by nondeductible merger related charges our effective tax rate for fiscal 2001 differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the net effect of nondeductible merger and divestiture related charges offset by the benefit received from taxexempt interest income at july 31 2003 we had net deferred tax assets of 2179 million which included a valuation allowance of 75 million for net operating loss carryforwards relating to our international subsidiaries and certain state capital loss carryforwards the allowance reflects management’s assessment that we may not receive the benefit of certain loss carryforwards of our international subsidiaries and capital loss carryforwards in certain state jurisdictions while we believe our current valuation allowance is sufficient it may be necessary to increase this amount if it becomes more likely that we will not realize a greater portion of the net deferred tax asset we assess the need for an adjustment to the valuation allowance on a quarterly basis see note 14 of the financial statements discontinued operations intuit kk on february 7 2003 we sold our wholly owned japanese subsidiary intuit kk and accounted for the sale as discontinued operations in accordance with sfas 144 we have segregated the operating results of intuit kk from continuing operations on our statement of operations for all

2001 we recorded a cumulative gain of 143 million net of income taxes as a result of a change in accounting principle when we adopted sfas 133 “accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities” we recognized the cumulative effect of the change in how we accounted for options to 39 purchase shares of s1 corporation as of august 1 2000 see note 1 of the financial statements subsequent fluctuations in the fair value of these options were included in our net income or net loss until we sold them in the first quarter of fiscal 2002 liquidity and capital resources at july 31

on our basic and diluted net income or loss per share in fiscal 2001 or 2002 while they increased our basic and diluted net income per share by 013 and 012 in fiscal 2003 outstanding loans to executive officers and other employees totaled 197 million at july 31 2003 and 213 million at july 31 2002 loans to executive officers are primarily relocation loans loans are generally secured by

the sarbanesoxley legislation enacted on july 30 2002 no loans to executive officers have been made or modified since july 30 2002 and we do not intend to make or modify loans to executive officers in the future see note 19 of the financial statements in march 2003 we repurchased 17532 shares of common stock from our chief executive officer at fair market value to provide him with the funds to pay the payroll tax withholding obligation relating to the vesting of his restricted stock see note 19 of the financial statements in the normal course of business we enter into leases for new or expanded facilities in both domestic and global locations we also evaluate on an ongoing basis the merits of acquiring technology or businesses or establishing 41 strategic relationships with and investing in other companies we may decide to use cash and cash equivalents to fund such activities in the future we believe that our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments will be sufficient to meet anticipated seasonal working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at july 31 2003  restricted cash at july 31 2003 included 40 million for product rebates due our customers and 57 million in obligations to our employees under deferred compensation plans restricted cash at july 31 2003 also

longterm obligations at july 31 2003 included the 83 million longterm portion of our reserve for vacant mountain view facilities longterm obligations also included 175 million for amounts we owe to former stockholders of cbs employer services inc in connection with our acquisition of that company in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 see note 13 of the financial statements recent accounting pronouncements in november 2002 the eitf reached a consensus on issue no 0021 “revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables” issue 0021 provides guidance on accounting for arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of multiple products services andor rights to use assets the provisions of issue 0021 will apply to revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june 15 2003 we do not believe that the adoption of issue 0021 will have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows in january 2003 the fasb issued fin 46 “consolidation of variable interest entities” fin 46 requires us to consolidate a variable interest entity if we are subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity’s activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity’s residual returns or both a variable interest entity is a corporation partnership trust or any other legal structure used for business purposes that either does not have equity investors with voting rights or has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities a variable interest entity often holds financial assets including loans or receivables real estate or other property a variable interest entity may be essentially passive or it may engage in research and development or other activities on behalf of another company the consolidation requirements of fin 46 apply immediately to variable interest entities created after january 31 2003 the consolidation requirements apply to older entities in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june 15 2003 some of the disclosure requirements apply to all financial statements issued after january 31 2003 regardless of when the variable interest entity was established we anticipate that the adoption of fin 46 will not have a material impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows in april 2003 the fasb issued statement no 149 “amendment of statement 133 on derivative instruments and hedging activities” statement 149 is intended to result in more consistent reporting of contracts as either 42 freestanding derivative instruments subject to statement 133 in its entirety or as hybrid instruments with debt host contracts and embedded derivative features in addition statement 149 clarifies the definition of a derivative by providing guidance on the meaning of initial net investments related to derivatives statement 149 is effective for contracts entered into or modified after june 30 2003 we do not believe the adoption of statement 149 will have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows in may 2003 the fasb issued statement no 150 “accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity” statement 150 establishes standards for classifying and measuring as liabilities certain financial instruments that embody obligations of the issuer and have characteristics of both liabilities and equity statement 150 represents a significant change in practice in the accounting for a number of financial instruments including mandatorily redeemable equity instruments and certain equity derivatives that are frequently used in connection with share repurchase programs we do not use such instruments in our share repurchase program statement 150 is effective for all financial instruments created or modified after may 31 2003 and to other instruments as of september 1 2003 we adopted statement 150 on june 1 2003 and do not believe the effect of adopting this statement will have a material impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 43 risks that could affect future results companywide factors that could affect future results we face intense competitive pressures in all of our businesses which can have a negative impact on our revenue profitability and market position we have formidable current and potential competitors accordingly we expect competition to remain intense during fiscal 2004 and beyond in all our businesses we face continual risks that competitors will introduce better products and services reduce prices gain better access to distribution channels increase advertising including advertising targeted at intuit customers and release new products and services before we do any of these competitive actions — particularly any prolonged price competition — could result in lower net revenue andor lower profitability for us they could also affect our ability to keep existing customers and acquire new customers for more information about the competitive environment in which we operate see item 1 “business — competition” and the competition risk factors for each of our businesses below if we do not continue to develop new products and services in a timely manner our future financial results will suffer it is necessary for us to continually develop new products and services and to improve existing products and services so that we can remain competitive in the markets we serve and in the markets we seek to enter in executing our customerfocused product strategies we have introduced a number of products and services that are specially designed for specific businesses and consumer needs many of our offerings have posed new product development challenges for us because several of these offerings require that our products and services integrate with one another and with both our web sites and our internal information systems in addition our customers expect — and our business model contemplates — increased functionality and greater interoperability among our products and services moreover our development and enhancement processes involve several risks including challenges in hiring and retaining highly qualified employees the risk of delays in product and service launches the risk of defects that hinder performance and the risk that consumers will not buy new or modified offerings failure to timely and successfully develop new products and services would harm our competitive position and result in declines in our revenue and earnings expanding our product and service offerings creates risks due to the increasing complexity and decreasing predictability of our revenue streams our expanding range of products and services generates more varied revenue streams than our traditional desktop software businesses the accounting policies that apply to these revenue streams are more complex than those that apply to our traditional products and services we expect this trend to continue as we acquire additional companies for example as we begin to offer additional features and options as part of multipleelement sales arrangements we could be required to defer a higher percentage of our product revenue at the time of sale than we do for traditional products this would decrease revenue at the time products are shipped but result in increased revenue in fiscal periods after shipment in addition our vertical business management solutions businesses offer products and services with significantly higher prices than we have traditionally offered revenue from these offerings tends to be less predictable than revenue from our traditional desktop products due to longer sales and implementation cycles these businesses also tend to rely on a relatively small number of large orders for a substantial portion of their revenue in a particular quarter which could cause our quarterly revenue from these businesses to fluctuate we are continuing to implement new information systems to enable us to execute on our growth strategy and problems with the design or implementation of these new systems could interfere with our business and operations we are in the process of implementing new information systems to eventually replace our existing systems as a part of this effort we began implementing in fiscal 2003 and will continue to implement in fiscal 2004 new software applications to manage our business and finance operations we may not successfully implement these new systems and transition data and even if we do succeed the implementation may be much more costly than we anticipated any disruptions relating to these systems enhancements could adversely impact our ability to do the following in a timely and accurate manner take customer orders ship products provide services and support to our customers bill and track our customers fulfill contractual obligations and otherwise run our business in addition many of our newer businesses depend on a different operational infrastructure than our desktop software businesses and we must continually develop expand and modify our internal systems and procedures — including call center customer management order management billing and other systems — to support these businesses if we are unable to successfully implement new information systems our financial position results of operations cash flows and stock price could be adversely affected 44 any significant failure in our technology systems could harm our operations and our financial performance we rely on a variety of technology systems to among other functions take and fulfill customer orders handle customer service requests host our webbased activities support internal operations and store customer and company data our computer and communications systems and operations could be damaged or interrupted or lose customer data any of which could prevent us from accepting and fulfilling customer orders and adversely impact our internal operations to prevent interruptions we must continually upgrade our systems and processes to ensure that we have adequate recoverability — both of which are costly and time consuming while we have backup systems for certain aspects of our operations our systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities in addition we may have inadequate insurance coverage or insurance limits to compensate us for losses from a major interruption if any of this were to occur it could harm our financial performance damage our reputation and be expensive to remedy business integration of acquired companies presents several challenges and we may not fully realize the intended benefits of our acquisitions if we do not successfully integrate them with our operations during the past few years we have completed numerous acquisitions two in fiscal 2003 and five in fiscal 2002 and we expect to continue to pursue acquisitions as part of our right for my business strategy these acquisitions expand our product and service offerings personnel and geographic locations and require us to integrate different company cultures management teams and business infrastructures the integration process can strain our resources and be expensive and time consuming particularly if we are integrating multiple companies at the same time promptly and efficiently integrating acquired businesses creates challenges for our operational financial and management information systems as well as for our product development processes we may have difficulty developing manufacturing and marketing the products of a newly acquired company in a way that enhances the performance of our combined businesses or product lines to realize the value from expected synergies depending on the size and complexity of an acquisition and the number of acquisitions we are concurrently integrating our successful integration of the entity depends on a variety of factors including  despite our efforts to adequately staff and equip our customer service and technical support operations we cannot always respond promptly to customer requests for assistance we occasionally experience customer service and technical support problems including longer than expected waiting times for customers when our staffing and systems are inadequate to handle a higherthananticipated volume of requests when we experience these problems they can adversely affect customer relationships and our financial results due to lost revenue because of our inability to accept orders for our products or increased costs we also risk losing service at any one of our customer contact centers and our redundancy systems could prove inadequate to provide backup support in addition our customerfocused business strategy presents additional technical support challenges as we increase the number and complexity of the products we offer particularly for our quickbooks consumer tax and vertical business management solutions segments to improve our performance in this area we must eliminate underlying causes of service and support requests through product improvements better order fulfillment processes more robust selfhelp tools and improved ability to accurately anticipate demand for support implementing any of these improvements can be expensive time consuming and ultimately prove unsuccessful given the nature of the products and services that we offer our revenue and earnings are highly seasonal several of our businesses are highly seasonal — particularly our tax businesses but also our small business software and service offerings to a lesser extent this causes significant quarterly fluctuations in our financial results revenue and operating results are usually strongest during the second and third fiscal quarters ending january 31 and april 30 we experience lower revenues and often significant operating losses in the first and fourth quarters ending october 31 and july 31 recently we have recognized an increasing portion of our consumer tax revenue in the third fiscal quarter compared to the second fiscal quarter our financial results can also fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year due to a variety of factors including changes in product sales mix that affect average selling prices product release dates the timing of sales of our higherpriced vertical business management solutions 45 offerings our methods for distributing our products including the shift to a consignment model for our consumer tax products that we sell through retail distribution channels and the timing of acquisitions dispositions and goodwill and purchased intangible asset impairment charges we face risks relating to customer privacy and security and increasing regulation which could hinder the growth of our businesses and affect our financial performance despite our efforts to address customer concerns about privacy and security these issues still pose a risk to our business and we have experienced lawsuits and negative publicity relating to privacy issues a major breach of customer privacy or security by intuit or even by another company could have serious consequences for our businesses including reduced customer demand for our products andor additional regulation by federal or state agencies in addition we have incurred — and will continue to incur — significant expenses to comply with mandatory privacy and security standards and protocols if additional similar federal and state laws andor regulations like the recently created federal “do not call list” that govern our direct marketing activities such as telesales and email campaigns are passed our ability to communicate with our customers may be further limited and our compliance costs may increase both of which could have a negative impact on our operating results moreover in response to concerns about their customers’ privacy third parties such as internet service providers have developed and may continue to develop technology that limits or impedes our ability to communicate with our customers particularly via email we face several risks relating to our retail distribution channel through which we sell our core desktop software products quickbooks turbotax and quicken we face challenges with our relationships with retailers including our ability to negotiate favorable terms with them the risk that retailers could consolidate and potentially eliminate the number of retail locations in which our products are offered and the negative effect of the current economic environment on retail sales generally in addition any change in significant business terms termination or significant disruption of our relationship with any of our major resellers could result in a decline in our revenue if any of our retailers experience financial difficulties it could have an adverse effect on our operating expenses if uncollectible amounts from them exceed the bad debt reserves we have established we face additional risks in the retail channel as we execute on our customerfocused product strategy through which we offer a collection of products and services that are tailored for a wide range of customers with differing needs we now offer several more stockkeeping units skus than we have in the past and some of these products can be more complex and priced higher than our traditional retail software products and therefore pose new challenges for us in the retail channel for example to market our quickbooks offerings at retail we have historically relied on product packaging instore displays and other retail merchandising to educate customers about our products however because our industryspecific versions of quickbooks which we call “flavors” are priced higher this strategy may prove less effective or ineffective given the increased need to educate potential customers about the added benefits of these products and the related higher pricing as a result we may need to incur additional expenses to develop other marketing programs that supplement our traditional instore promotional efforts to sell these products to customers in addition retailers may be reluctant to carry the higherpriced skus because they are new offerings and we have not yet been able to demonstrate demand for these products at levels that are desirable to our retailers finally our customerfocused product strategy — and in particular our right for my business strategy — is resulting in a greater number of intuit products that we’re asking our retailers to stock therefore we may experience difficulty in negotiating with our retailers to ensure that they will carry all of our skus and to ensure that they will carry an adequate supply of all of the different versions of our products in their stores if retail distribution proves an ineffective channel for certain of our new offerings and our quickbooks flavors in particular it could adversely impact our growth revenue and profitability acquisitionrelated costs can cause significant fluctuation in our net income our recent acquisitions have resulted in significant expenses including amortization of purchased software which is reflected in cost of revenue as well as charges for inprocess research and development and amortization and impairment of goodwill purchased intangible assets and deferred compensation which are reflected in operating expenses total acquisitionrelated costs in the categories identified above were 2630 million in fiscal 2001 1960 million in fiscal 2002 and 566 million in fiscal 2003 fiscal 2003 acquisitionrelated costs have declined primarily because of a change in the accounting treatment of goodwill however we may incur less frequent but larger impairment charges related to the goodwill already recorded and to goodwill arising out of future acquisitions as of july 31 2003 we had an unamortized goodwill balance of approximately 5911 million which could be subject to impairment charges in the 46 future additional acquisitions and any impairment of the value of purchased assets could have a significant negative impact on our future operating results  if we are required to account for options under our employee stock plans as a compensation expense it would significantly reduce our net income and earnings per share although we are not currently required to record any compensation expense in connection with option grants to employees that have an exercise price at or above fair market value it is possible that future laws or regulations will require us to treat all employee stock options as a compensation expense the increased compensation expense would significantly reduce our net income and earnings per share under generally accepted accounting principles if actual product returns exceed returns reserves our revenue would be lower we ship more desktop software products to our distributors and retailers than we expect them to sell in order to reduce the risk that distributors or retailers will run out of products this is particularly true for our consumer tax products which have a short selling season and for which returns occur primarily in our fourth fiscal quarter like most software companies we have historically accepted significant product returns we establish reserves against revenue for product returns in our financial statements based on estimated future returns of products we closely monitor levels of product sales and inventory in the retail channel in an effort to maintain reserves that are adequate to cover expected returns in the past returns have not generally exceeded these reserves however if we do experience actual returns that significantly exceed reserves it would result in lower net revenue we rely on thirdparty vendors to handle all outsourced aspects of manufacturing and distribution for our primary retail and primary direct desktop software products to manufacture and distribute our primary retail products at the time of product launches and to replenish products in the retail channel after the primary launch we have a manufacturing relationship with modus media and a distribution arrangement with ingram micro logistics to manufacture and distribute our primary direct products quickbooks turbotax and quicken we have a manufacturing and distribution relationship with arvato services inc while we believe that relying on only three outsourcers for product launches and replenishment improves the efficiency and reliability of these activities relying on any vendor for a significant aspect of our business can have severe negative consequences if the vendor fails to perform at acceptable service levels for any reason including but not limited to financial difficulties of the vendor legal protection for our intellectual property is not always effective to prevent unauthorized use or copying current us laws that prohibit copying give us only limited practical protection from software piracy and the laws of many other countries provide very little protection policing unauthorized use and copying of our products is difficult expensive and time consuming in addition efforts to protect our intellectual property may not be positively perceived by our customers although we continue to evaluate technology solutions to piracy as well as increase our civil and criminal enforcement efforts we expect piracy to be a persistent problem changes to federal or state laws andor regulations could impact our ability to enforce our intellectual property rights also the internet may tend to increase and provide new methods for illegal copying of our desktop and internetbased products and services in addition we face risks relating to licensing our intellectual property to third parties for example we licensed the use of the quicken loans and quicken mortgage trademarks to the purchaser of our quicken loans mortgage business if the purchaser violates the terms of the trademark license it could result in serious harm to intuit’s reputation and serious and irreparable harm to the value of our quickenrelated brands we do not own all of the software other technologies and content used in our products and services we have the licenses from third parties that we believe are necessary for using technology and content that we do not own in our current products and services from time to time we may be required to renegotiate with these third parties — or negotiate with new third parties — to include their technology or content in our existing products in new versions of our current products or in new products we may not be able to negotiate or renegotiate licenses on reasonable terms or at all if we’re unable to obtain the rights necessary to use thirdparty technology or content in our products and services we may not be able to sell the affected products which would in turn have a negative impact on our revenue and operating results we may unintentionally infringe on the intellectual property rights of others which could expose us to substantial damages or restrict our business operations as the number of our products and services increases and their features and content continue to expand and as we acquire technology through acquisitions or licenses we may increasingly become subject to infringement claims by third parties from time to time we have received communications from 47 third parties in which the claimant alleges that a product or service we offer infringes the claimant’s intellectual property rights occasionally these communications result in lawsuits in many of these cases it is difficult to assess the extent to which the intellectual property right that the claimant asserts is valid or the extent to which we have any material exposure past claims have not resulted in any significant litigation settlement or licensing expenses but future claims could present an exposure of uncertain magnitude existing or future infringement claims or lawsuits against us whether valid or not may be time consuming and expensive to defend intellectual property litigation or claims could force us to do one or more of the following cease selling incorporating or using products or services that incorporate the challenged intellectual property obtain a license from the holder of the infringed intellectual property which may not be available on commercially favorable terms or at all or redesign our software products or services possibly in a manner that reduces their commercial appeal any of these actions may cause material harm to our business and financial results specific factors affecting our quickbooks small business products and services and vertical business management solutions segments in our quickbooks and our small business products and services businesses we face a wide range of competitive risks that could impact our financial results our quickbooks business faces current competition from competitors’ desktop and webbased software offerings many competitors and potential competitors have begun providing or have expressed significant interest in providing accounting and business management products and services to small businesses as we expand the depth and breadth of our small business offerings we face additional competition from others who are already offering industryspecific small business solutions and business management tools and services for larger small businesses microsoft has several small business offerings that compete with our small business offerings including microsoft business solutions small business manager microsoft busines solutions crm and business contact manager for microsoft office outlook® 2003 we expect that microsoft small business offerings will continue to compete with our small business offerings perhaps even more directly in the future in addition we face direct competition in our intuit payroll services complete payroll business from traditional payroll services offered by a number of companies including adp and paychex our financial supplies business faces ongoing pricing pressures from many of our competitors as we implement our right for my business strategy we face increased competitive threats from larger companies in bigger markets than we have historically faced we face competitive pressures in our vertical business management solutions segment  all of our vertical business management solutions businesses operate in highly competitive and fragmented environments where no competitor has a significant share of the market segment we may experience pricing pressure in these market segments because we compete with many small companies who have fewer resources than larger companies and are therefore more likely to focus on nearterm sales in each of these market segments the possibility exists that through either consolidation within the market segment or the entry into the market segment of new companies a significant competitor will emerge it is too soon to provide assurance that we will be able to generate substantial and sustained revenue growth from new products and services in the quickbooks small business products and services and vertical business management solutions segments to meet our growth goals we must generate revenue from a wider range of market and customer segments as well as from new products and services there are a number of risks associated with our growth strategy including  48  our acquisition strategy entails a number of challenges that could limit our successful implementation of the strategy a key component of our right for my business strategy is to continue to expand our product and service offerings and we expect to derive a significant portion of this expansion from acquisitions we could face the following risks relating to our strategy and future acquisitions in addition to the integration challenges noted above  revenue growth for our vertical business management solutions segment may be hindered by a variety of factors which could have a negative impact on overall company revenue growth revenue growth for our vertical business management solutions business is subject to numerous risks among these are the negative impact of the current economic environment on customer purchases of the relatively highpriced software solutions offered by these businesses strong pricing pressure in these markets because we compete with many small companies who have fewer resources than larger companies and are therefore more likely to focus on nearterm sales  our ability to successfully acquire other companies and the potential disruption to the businesses of the acquired companies during the acquisition integration process in addition revenue growth in any particular period may be difficult to predict because of the complex revenue streams generated by these businesses and the corresponding complexity in the accounting policies that apply to them our financial supplies business relies on a singlesource vendor we have an exclusive contract with john h harland company to print and fulfill supplies orders for all of our checks and most other products for our financial supplies business harland fulfilled orders for about 75 to 85 of our supplies revenue in fiscal 2001 and 2002 and almost 95 of our supplies revenue in fiscal 2003 we believe that relying on one vendor improves customer service and maximizes operational efficiencies for our supplies business however if there are significant problems with harland’s performance it could have a material negative impact on sales of supplies and on intuit’s financial results as a whole our payroll businesses face a number of risks that could have a negative impact on revenue and profitability for our payroll businesses we must process customer data accurately reliably and timely in order to attract and retain customers and avoid the costs associated with errors we must also accurately and timely develop new and upgraded payroll products to enable our customers to meet the various regulatory deadlines associated with employerrelated payroll activities if we failed to timely deliver any of our payroll products it could cause our current and prospective customers to choose a competitor’s product for that year’s payroll and not to purchase intuit products in the future in order to generate sustained growth for our intuit payroll services complete payroll we will be required to successfully develop and manage a more extensive and proactive direct field sales operation which is a different distribution method than those we have historically utilized as our payroll businesses involve the processing of large amounts of payroll funds and the remittance of large amounts of income taxes there is a potential for errors in processing the payments or misappropriation of payroll funds by either our customers’ 49 employees or our own employees any such error or misappropriation could subject intuit to liabilities that could be substantial in addition we are authorized by our customers to transfer money from their bank accounts to fund amounts owed to their employees and taxing authorities it is possible that we could be held liable for such amounts in the event the client has insufficient funds to cover them moreover our payroll businesses other than our doityourself product include as part of their revenue interest on customer deposits not yet remitted to taxing authorities or to customers’ employees if interest rates decline or there take effect regulatory changes either decreasing the amount of taxes withheld or allowing less time to remit taxes to taxing authorities it would result in less interest revenue for those businesses if any of the above eventualities came to pass it could have a negative impact on the revenue profitability and future growth of our payroll businesses specific factors affecting our consumer tax and professional accounting solutions segments we face intense competitive pressures from both the private and public sectors in our consumer tax and professional accounting solutions businesses that could have a negative impact on revenue profitability and market position there are formidable current and potential competitors in the private sector for both our consumer and professional tax products and we expect competition to remain intense in the future our major domestic competitor for both desktop and webbased consumer tax software continues to be hr block the makers of taxcut software and our largest professional tax competitors are cch incorporated with its prosystem fx product line kleinrock publishing with its atx product line and the thomson corporation with its creative solutions and gosystem offerings these competitive pressures can have a negative impact on our revenue profitability and market position in addition we face current and potential competition from a number of publicly funded government entities that are offering individual taxpayers electronic tax preparation andor filing services at no cost to individual taxpayers if governmental agencies are able to develop consumer tax preparation and filing services and to gain consumer acceptance of those services it could have a negative impact on our financial results in future years the federal government signed a threeyear free file alliance agreement in october 2002 under which a number of private sector companies rather than the federal government are providing webbased federal tax preparation and filing services at no cost through voluntary public services initiatives such as our intuit tax freedom project however future administrative regulatory or legislative activity in this area could have a strong adverse impact the financial performance of our consumer tax and professional accounting solutions businesses the product activation technology that we introduced into certain turbotax desktop products last year could have an adverse impact on this year’s results for our consumer tax business during tax year 2002 federal versions of turbotax desktop products for windows included product activation technology that helped to prevent unlicensed users from using passalong andor counterfeit copies of turbotax to print or electronically file a tax return the introduction of product activation generated negative commentary in the media and in online forums and also resulted in a modest increase in the volume of customers contacting our customer service and technical support centers while we have publicly announced that we will not include product activation in retail versions of turbotax for windows for the upcoming tax season there is uncertainty about whether the negative publicity and customer reactions to and experiences with this technology last year will impact our consumer tax business this year any significant negative repercussions relating to product activation could adversely impact our fiscal 2004 results for our consumer tax business in particular and our financial performance as a whole significant problems or delays in developing our consumer tax and professional tax products would result in lost revenue and customers developing tax preparation software presents a unique challenge because of the demanding annual development cycle required to incorporate unpredictable tax law and tax form changes each year and because our customers expect high levels of accuracy and a timely launch of these products our tax preparation software business which represents a substantial portion of our annual revenue is highly seasonal since the customers in that market generally prepare and file their taxes by april 15 a significantly late product launch could result in lost revenue and lost customers it could cause our current and prospective customers to choose a competitor’s product for that year’s tax season or to choose not to purchase tax preparation software at all these risks could result in lost revenue in the current tax year and would make it more difficult for us to sell our products to customers in future tax seasons moreover the rigid development timetable increases the risk of errors in our products and the risk of launch delays any major defects could lead to negative publicity customer dissatisfaction and incremental 50 operating expenses including expenses resulting from our commitment to reimburse penalties and interest paid by consumer customers due solely to calculation errors in our products if we fail to maintain reliable and responsive service levels for our electronic tax offerings we could lose revenue and customers our webbased tax preparation and electronic filing services must effectively handle extremely heavy customer demand during the peak tax season and the exact level of demand for these offerings is difficult to predict we face significant risks and challenges in maintaining these services and maintaining adequate service levels particularly during peak volume service times for example we experienced a relatively brief unscheduled interruption in our electronic filing service on april 15 2003 during which certain users of our professional tax products were unable to receive confirmation from us that their electronic filing had been accepted we also experienced relatively brief unscheduled interruptions in our electronic filingandor tax preparation services during tax years 1999 and 2000 and we reached maximum capacity for a short period on april 15 2002 we also face risks related to the performance of our redundancy and data recoverability systems in these businesses if our redundancy and data recoverability systems are inadequate then we could lose the ability to provide these services — or provided these services at inadequate levels — to our customers if we experience any prolonged difficulties with our webbased tax preparation or electronic filing service at any time during the tax season we could lose current and future customers receive negative publicity and incur increased operating costs any of which could have a significant negative impact on the financial and market success of these businesses and have a negative impact on our nearterm and longterm financial results increased state filing mandates could significantly increase our costs we are required to comply with a variety of state revenue agency standards in order to successfully operate our tax preparation and electronic filing services changes in stateimposed requirements by one or more of the states including the required use of specific technologies or technology standards could significantly increase the costs of providing those services to our customers if we are unable to significantly increase accountantfacilitated sales it could have a negative impact on revenue growth we are currently focused on developing relationships with accounting professionals in order to expand our opportunities to sell small business products and services to their clients under our “right for my firm right for my clients” strategy we view this strategy as an important driver for our professional accounting solutions segment as well as our quickbooks and small business products and services businesses however since this is a new model for us we face several risks associated with it including the risk that we will not be able to effectively execute this strategy and the risk that we will not derive the anticipated benefits including financial benefits from this strategy we face intense competition in this effort as there are an increasing number of alliances between accountants and other professional tax preparers and providers of small business software and services that aim to capitalize on accountantfacilitated sales of small business products and services to their clients specific factors affecting our other businesses segment our other businesses products face competition that could have a negative impact on revenue profitability and market position our quicken products compete — domestically and internationally — directly with microsoft money which is aggressively promoted and priced we expect competitive pressures for quicken to continue both from microsoft money and from webbased personal finance tracking and management tools that are becoming increasingly available at no cost to consumers competitive pressures can result in reduced revenue and lower profitability for our quicken product line in canada we face competition from a number of companies in the small business consumer tax and professional tax businesses the longterm viability of our personal finance business will depend on our ability to provide new products and services that attract customers the demand for personal finance desktop software products — such as our quicken offering — has been weakening over recent years due to the increasing availability of free webbased personal finance tracking and management tools through financial institutions and others in addition the demand for internet advertising on web sites like quickencom has declined precipitously we must identify and capitalize on additional sources of revenue for our personal finance business to continue to grow that business and we face the risk that any approach that we take to increase revenue for this business may not succeed 51 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk shortterm investment portfolio we do not hold derivative financial instruments in our shortterm investment portfolio our shortterm investments consist of instruments that meet quality standards consistent with our investment policy this policy specifies that except for direct obligations of the united states government and money market or cash management funds we diversify our holdings and limit our shortterm investments with any individual issuer to a maximum of 50 million in each of our three managed portfolios the following table of our shortterm investments portfolio is classified by the original maturity date listed on the security and reflects instruments with both taxable and taxexempt interest rates principal amounts by stated maturity  interest rate risk our cash equivalents and shortterm investment portfolio are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates interest rate movements affect the interest income we earn on cash equivalents and shortterm investments and the value of those investments over the past few years we have experienced significant reductions in our interest income due to declines in interest rates these declines have led to interest rates that are low by historical standards and we do not believe that further decreases in interest rates will have a material impact on the interest income earned on our cash equivalents and shortterm investments held at july 31 2003 impact of foreign currency rate changes we translate foreign currencies primarily canadian dollars and british pounds into us dollars for financial reporting purposes accordingly currency fluctuations can have an impact on our financial results though the historical impact has generally been immaterial we believe that our exposure to currency exchange fluctuation risk is not significant primarily because our global subsidiaries invoice customers and satisfy their financial obligations almost exclusively in their local currencies there was a nominal currency exchange impact from our intercompany transactions for fiscal 2001 and 2002 due to the effect of the weakening us dollar on intercompany balances with our canadian subsidiary we recorded foreign currency exchange gains of 54 million in fiscal 2003 although the impact of currency fluctuations on our financial results has generally been immaterial in the past and we believe that for the reasons cited above currency fluctuations will not be significant in the future there can be no guarantee that the impact of currency fluctuations will not be material in the future as of july 31 2003 we did not engage in foreign currency hedging activities 52

companies that advertise andor sell their products or services through links from quickencom global business we have business operations in canada and japan and we also serve markets across europe southeast asia and other selected locations we have established thirdparty relationships with local companies in certain countries to help us better address specific markets in all international markets except canada and europe we focus primarily on small business products canada and united kingdom in canada we offer localized versions of quickbooks and quicken the myob accounting product line which we acquired during fiscal 2002 quicktax tm consumer tax products profile tm financial application suite professional tax products and quickenca sm  a personal finance web site with content similar to quickencom in the united kingdom we also offer localized versions of quickbooks and quicken as well as the taxcalc tm consumer tax return product which we acquired in fiscal 2002 japan the principal product we offer in japan is yayoi® a small business accounting product that addresses the midsized companies segment of the small business market in japan sales of yayoi products also generate recurring revenue from ongoing support contracts that are sold with the software during fiscal 2002 we discontinued our japanese version of quickbooks other locations we offer localized versions of quickbooks and quicken products in selected european markets through local distributors and agents we also offer localized versions of quickbooks and quicken products in australia new zealand hong kong and singapore through a development marketing and distribution arrangement with australiabased reckon limited 7 small business verticals and other as part of our right for my business strategy we have acquired several companies that enable us to provide accounting and business management solutions to customers in selected industries which we refer to as “verticals” these new businesses which we report as a single business segment include the following intuit construction business solutions formerly omware inc which provides business management solutions for the construction industry intuit public sector solutions formerly american fundware which offers accounting and business management software solutions for nonprofit organizations universities and government agencies intuit mri real estate solutions formerly management reports inc which provides business management software solutions for commercial and residential property managers and intuit eclipse distribution management solutions formerly eclipse inc which offers business management software for the wholesale durable goods industry product development historically our desktop software products have tended to have a fairly predictable structured development cycle of about a year with annual releases for our small business desktop products we now supplement annual releases of our core quickbooks products with ongoing releases of products that address the specialized requirements of selected vertical industries as well as products for larger or more complex businesses the development cycles for our service offerings are less predictable and are generally much shorter than for our desktop products the development of tax preparation software presents a unique challenge because of the demanding development cycle required to incorporate annual tax law and tax form changes each year for a description of other risks and challenges we face relating to our product development see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — risks that could affect future results” during the past few years we have devoted significant resources to developing new products and services including quickbooks premier quickbooks premier accountant edition quickbooks enterprise solutions business management software the intuit developer network and the instant data entry feature of our turbotax products and services we supplement our internal development efforts by acquiring strategically important products and technology from third parties or establishing other relationships that enable us to expand our business more rapidly for example during fiscal 2002 we acquired four companies that provide small business management products in vertical industries we worked closely with a third party technology provider to develop our quickbooks point of sale software and we formed an exclusive strategic alliance with siebert financial corp to offer brokerage services to consumers we also devote resources to improving our existing products and services for our desktop software products our recent development efforts have focused on creating an easier endtoend customer experience as well as adding new features we also incorporate technology in our products and services to address customer concerns about privacy and security while minimizing the impact on performance and ease of use in addition we have focused in recent years on developing technology that helps reduce unlicensed use of some of our tax products our fiscal 2002 professional tax products as well as consumer tax products in canada contained product activation technology that restricted sharing of the products in september 2002 we announced that federal tax versions of turbotax desktop products for windows for the 2002 tax season will include product activation technology that will prevent a customer from using a single copy of turbotax to print or efile a tax return from more than one personal computer during the past few years we have made a number of improvements to our product development process we now team technical support and product development personnel so that we can anticipate feature usability and support issues early in the development process by enhancing the design process for our quickbooks 2002 products we improved product quality and significantly lowered our customer service and technical support call volume we have made other changes that have allowed us to shorten the development cycle which is enabling us to launch new products more quickly 8 our research and development expenses were 1659 million in fiscal 2000 2037 million in fiscal 2001 and 2035 million in fiscal 2002 during fiscal 2002 we significantly increased research and development spending in some of our highestgrowth businesses — small business consumer tax and professional accounting solutions — but these increases were offset by significant decreases in spending in less strategic areas and discontinued businesses over the next few years we expect that our research and development efforts will be focused on developing new products and services to address customer needs in our more broadly defined market segments and adding complementary products and services to drive additional recurring revenue from our core products such as additional products and services for our small business customers we strive to maintain a balance between relatively lowrisk investments that address existing customer needs and investments in more innovative but higherrisk projects with potentially greater returns marketing sales and distribution markets recently we have expanded both the markets that we serve as well as the products and services that we offer in our target markets historically our target markets were individuals and small businesses with less than 20 employees we continue to serve those markets with products and services such as quickbooks turbotax and quicken in addition to these markets we are now targeting small businesses with up to 250 employees we are addressing this new customer segment with a number of new products and services under the umbrella of our right for my business strategy we are introducing industryspecific solutions to meet the specialized requirements of small businesses in selected vertical industries by developing industryspecific version of quickbooks and acquiring companies that offer business management solutions to small businesses in selected vertical markets in addition we recently introduced new versions of quickbooks for companies that due to their larger size or complexity have more demanding accounting needs we have also introduced business solutions that go beyond accounting software to address a wider range of business management challenges that small businesses face we expect to continue expanding in these directions over the next several years see “business overview — “right for me” product strategy” and “products and services” above for more details about our product and service offerings many of the markets in which we compete are characterized by rapidly changing customer demands continuous technological changes and improvements shifting industry standards and frequent new product introductions by competitors market and industry changes can quickly render existing products and services obsolete so our success depends on our ability to respond rapidly to these changes with new or enhanced products and services new business models alternative distribution methods different competitive strategies and other changes to the way we do business distribution channels over the past year we have been expanding our distribution channels to accommodate the recent expansion of both the markets we serve and the range of products and services we offer direct sales channel for our core desktop software products quickbooks turbotax and quicken we use various direct sales campaigns including mail and telephone solicitations directresponse newspaper and magazine advertising and television and radio advertising to generate software orders stimulate retail demand and generally maintain and increase consumer awareness of our products direct marketing campaigns are one of the most effective ways to encourage existing customers to purchase additional products and services including software upgrades direct sales made up a significant portion of our total desktop software revenue in fiscal 2002 as they often generate significantly higher revenue per unit than retail sales particularly for our small business and tax products many of our direct customers choose to order andor take delivery of products electronically through our web sites electronic ordering and delivery are generally more convenient for customers and more costefficient for intuit electronic delivery has been a particularly effective method of distribution for our 9 turbotax state tax preparation products and for product updates for our professional tax products during fiscal 2002 products ordered andor delivered electronically accounted for a growing percentage of our direct sales revenue for our core desktop software and we expect this trend to continue in fiscal 2003 

our direct sales efforts have historically focused on generating sales of relatively inexpensive offtheshelf products to existing customers our service offerings as well as our more sophisticated higherpriced software products require a more robust approach to direct sales than desktop software as we have expanded our services offerings and introduced more highend software products and business management solutions over the past year we have been enhancing our direct sales capabilities to support revenue growth in these new areas as well as in our core desktop software we are investing in technology to consolidate and improve our management of customer contact data and order management tools across business divisions process excellence initiatives in fiscal 2002 have resulted in improvements in lead generation and order management as well as more consultative selling by our customer service personnel in addition we have expanded our direct sales staff and broadened its role to include more extensive and personalized contact with existing and potential customers in particular some of the new products and services we now offer as a result of recent acquisitions are sold primarily through direct field sales organizations as a result of all of these efforts we expect that direct sales will become an increasingly important source of revenue over the next few years retail distribution channel we market our quickbooks turbotax and quicken desktop software in north america primarily through traditional retail software outlets computer superstores office supply superstores warehouse clubs and general mass merchandisers in international markets we also rely on distributors valueadded resellers and other third parties who sell products into the retail channel in fiscal 2002 we began distributing our turbotax products through safeway inc one of the largest food and drug retailers in north america this enabled us to reach a significant number of new customers we expect to continue expanding our retail distribution locations to reach more new customers in fiscal 2003 we continue to benefit from strong relationships with a number of major retailers which allows us to minimize our dependency on any specific retailer we are reducing our dependency on distributors as we ship more of our products directly to individual retail locations see “manufacturing and distribution” however the recent slowdown in consumer demand for software has resulted in software becoming a less important category for retailers as a result of this trend we have faced challenges in ensuring good product placement within retail stores see “competition” and “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — risks that could affect future results” we ship more products to our retailers than we expect them to sell in order to reduce the risk that they will run out of products this is particularly true for our tax products as a result we often experience significant levels of product returns from the retail channel after the end of the tax season — during the fourth quarter as well as the first quarter of the following fiscal year see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — risks that could affect future results” as we execute on our right for my business strategy we are starting to offer more complex higherpriced software products than our traditional retail software products it is not yet clear whether the retail channel will be an effective distribution channel for some of these higherend offerings oem channel we have existing relationships with a number of personal computer “original equipment manufacturers” or oems including dell computer corporation apple computer inc and hewlettpackard that enable us to generate sales of our core desktop software products in two ways first certain oems “prebundle” newuser versions of certain desktop software products on the computer systems that the oems sell to their customers although these prebundled oem sales sometimes generate little revenue or initial profit for intuit due to the low prices that the oems may pay for the products and slow sales in their own businesses they are a good source of new customers and future revenues the second source of revenue from the oem channel is “aftermarket” programs in which customers who are purchasing computers can select and purchase software products at the same time 10 thirdparty “valueadded” distribution arrangements as we execute on our right for my business strategy we are supplementing our direct sales capabilities and our retail distribution relationships with selected thirdparty distribution arrangements we believe these relationships will enhance the growth opportunities for our expanded and higherend product and service offerings by allowing us to benefit from the valueadded marketing and sales expertise of these third parties we currently have arrangements with third parties who have specialized expertise in marketing selling and providing postsale implementation services for the vertical business management solutions offered by our construction business solutions and public sector solutions businesses which we acquired during fiscal 2002 during fiscal 2003 and beyond we expect to expand our network of thirdparty relationships to help increase revenue for some of our existing higherend product and service offerings as well as for additional products and service we anticipate offering as we execute our right for my business strategy competition overview we face intense competition in almost all of our business areas both domestically and globally some of our existing competitors have significantly greater financial technical and marketing resources than we do as we implement our right for my business strategy we face increased competitive threats from larger companies in bigger markets than we have historically faced in addition the competitive landscape can shift rapidly as new companies enter markets in which we compete see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — risks that could affect future results” for our turbotax quicken and lowerend quickbooks desktop software we believe the most important competitive factors are product features ease of use size of the installed customer base brand name recognition price product and support quality and access to distribution channels we believe we compete effectively on most of these factors as our three principal desktop software products are the leading products in the retail sales channel for their respective categories for most of our products and services other than desktop software we believe the most important competitive factors are features and ease of use brand name recognition speed in getting new products and services to market and the ability to distribute them effectively through online methods or through retailers third party resellers and direct distribution for our service offerings service reliability and scalability of operations are also important factors we believe we compete effectively on these factors our most obvious competition comes from other companies that offer technology solutions similar to ours these competitors are described below however for many of our products and services the primary competitive alternatives for customers are manual tools and processes or general purpose software a significant portion of our new customers are people who have used pencil and paper or software such as word processors and spreadsheets rather than competitors’ software and services to perform financial tasks for example many taxpayers prepared their tax returns manually a large number of small businesses used spreadsheets to keep their book and they processed their payroll using spreadsheets and manuallywritten checks and most of our personal finance customers tracked their finances with spreadsheets manually or not at all before purchasing quicken small business employer services and small business verticals competitors for our small business accounting and business management offerings include companies such as peachtree software which is owned by the sage group plc myob group microsoft corp and the american institute of certified public accountants’ cpa2biz subsidiary microsoft recently acquired a provider of integrated software solutions for small and mediumsized businesses and microsoft great plains recently acquired quicksell retail pointofsale applications another factor in the competitive environment is the increasing number of alliances between professional tax preparers and providers of small business software and services that aim to capitalize on accountantfacilitated sales of small business products and services to their clients in addition to established competitors other potential competitors 11 have expressed significant interest in providing accounting and other products and services to small businesses as we expand the depth and breadth of our small business offerings we face additional competition from others who are already offering industryspecific small business solutions and business management tools and services for larger small businesses 

our financial supplies business competes with a number of business forms companies including new england business service and deluxe business systems as well as with printing services offered by franchises such as kinko’s and large office supply retailers such as office depot and staples other competitors include direct mail check printers banks and a number of smallerscale internetbased printing companies in addition our quickbooks products include some features such as customizable invoicing that compete with our supplies products online bill payment services and online payroll services with direct deposit capabilities also offer competitive alternatives to printed checks significant competitive factors for the supplies business include ordering convenience methods of reaching customers product quality speed of delivery and price we believe our convenient access to our large quickbooks and quicken customer bases is a significant competitive advantage for us our payroll services compete directly with traditional payroll service providers as well as webbased service providers significant competitive factors include distribution channels a highly fragmented market including financial institutions that are developing or promoting their own payroll services and offerings by nontraditional competitors such as microsoft’s bcentral we face direct competition in our intuit payroll services — complete payroll business from traditional payroll services offered by a number of companies including paychex and adp our quickbooks assisted payroll service competes directly with companies offering webbased payroll services and indirectly with companies offering other payroll solutions peachtree and others also offer tax table subscription services that compete directly with our quickbooks doityourself payroll offering consumer tax competition in the consumer tax preparation market is intense our major domestic competitor for both desktop and webbased consumer tax software continues to be hr block the makers of taxcut software however microsoft offered a competitive product for one season our fiscal 2000 and new competitors may enter these markets in the future we also compete for customers with professional tax preparers particularly those with franchise operations webbased tax preparation is still a relatively new service and we expect the competitive landscape to evolve as more competitors enter the market and others consolidate we also face potential competitive challenges from electronic tax preparation and filing services offered by state governments see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — risks that could affect future results” professional accounting solutions the professional tax preparation software marketplace has many competitors our largest competitors in the us are cch incorporated with its prosystem fx product line and ria with its creative solutions and gosystem offerings in the past the professional tax market has been highly fragmented but it has experienced some consolidation in recent years personal finance in desktop personal finance software the microsoft money product is our primary domestic competition we also face competition from webbased personal finance tracking and management tools that are available at no cost to consumers there are many competitors for our other personal finance products and services for example our quickencom site competes for traffic and advertising and sponsorship sales with online financial publishers the financial areas on numerous online services such as yahoo and financiallyoriented web sites such as microsoft’s money central our online brokerage offering through siebert financial corp competes with numerous other brokerage services however we believe that the ability of quicken customers to integrate brokerage transaction data into their quicken records gives us a 12 competitive advantage over other brokerage offerings some portals and financial institutions also provide service offerings such as webbased bill presentment and payment that compete with services we offer we also face competition from financial institutions that offer their own financial software and web sites 

global business in canada we face competition from a number of companies in the small business arena including computer associates international inc the primary competitor in canada for our consumer tax business is taxamatic inc the makers of taxwiz and the primary competitor for our professional tax business is cch canadian limited in japan our primary competitors in the small business accounting arena are obc pca and sorimachi in europe we face competition from the sage group plc based in the united kingdom bhuldata wiso microsoft and microsoft great plains in the small business market as well as competition from webbased accounting products our primary global competitor in the personal finance arena is microsoft customer service and technical support we provide customer service and technical support by telephone online chat fax email and our customer service and technical support web sites we have fulltime customer service and technical support staffs which we occasionally supplement with seasonal employees and outsourcing during periods of peak call volumes such as during the tax return filing season or following a major product launch during the past few years we have focused on developing support capabilities that can supplement or in some situations replace telephone service and support for example customers can use our web sites to find answers to commonly asked questions check on the status of a product order and receive bug fixes electronically alternative service and support methods are less expensive for us and are often more efficient and effective for customers as well we have completed a number of six sigma process excellence projects in our customer service and technical support operations to improve our call capacity forecasting develop more flexible approaches to staffing and reduce support call volumes and handling times we may also consider outsourcing a greater portion of our customer service and technical support operations we believe these projects are critical to our ongoing efforts to provide better service to customers at the same or lower cost we generally charge customers for technical support but we do not charge for product defect issues or selfhelp support through our technical support web sites support alternatives and fees vary widely by product from selfhelp to chat to phone support to onsite installation customers generally have a choice of different support alternatives at different prices depending on the response time they require despite our efforts to adequately staff and equip our customer service and technical support operations we cannot always respond promptly to customer requests for assistance when we experience customer service and support problems they can adversely affect customer relationships and our financial results our right for my business strategy presents additional technical support challenges as we increase the number and complexity of the products we offer in addition we expect most of our growth over the next several years to come from our small business and tax products which typically require more live technical support than personal finance products see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — risks that could affect future results” manufacturing and distribution desktop software the major steps involved in manufacturing desktop software are duplicating cds and floppy disks printing boxes and related materials and assembling and shipping the final products we have a manufacturing agreement with modus media international inc under which modus provides substantially all outsourced manufacturing related to our retail and direct launches of quickbooks turbotax and quicken as well as 13 for daytoday retail order fulfillment after product launches modus has operations in multiple locations to provide redundancy we recently entered into an agreement with sony disc manufacturing under which sony provides some of the components modus uses to manufacture our products we expect this arrangement will result in lower manufacturing costs and shorter manufacturing cycle times we also have an inhouse facility that handles the manufacturing and shipping for most direct sales orders 

we have multiple sources for all of our raw materials and availability has not been a problem for us in the past over the past few years we have taken steps to streamline our packaging and reduce our inventory and scrap costs to generate greater profitability in our core desktop software businesses our retail product launches have become operationally more complex over the past few years we have evolved from shipping to a few hundred distribution centers with distributors delivering products to individual retail locations to a “direct to storefront” model in which we ship products directly to almost 10000 individual retail locations this allows us to be more responsive to the needs of our retail accounts we have an agreement with ingram micro logistics under which ingram handles all logistics fulfillment and similar functions for our retail sales during the past year we have focused on better operational rigor at various points in our supply chain as a result we have significantly increased our ontime shipments and significantly reduced our aggregate channel inventory levels we have also reduced our dependency on distributors or on any individual retail account one distributor ingram micro inc accounted for 10 of total net revenue in fiscal 2000 no retailer accounted for 10 or more of our total net revenue during the past three fiscal years and no distributor met this threshold in fiscal 2001 or 2002 we believe that using these three vendors modus media sony and ingram micro logistics to handle essentially all manufacturing and distribution respectively for our three primary retail product launches improves the efficiency and reliability of our product launches and enables us to move more quickly to the directtostorefront model preferred by many of our retailers it also allows us to better manage inventory levels however exclusive reliance on one vendor for specific functions can have severe negative consequences on our business revenue and operating results if a vendor fails to perform for any reason accordingly we continue to evaluate other vendors in order to increase efficiencies and facilitate contingency planning see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — risks that could affect future results” prior to major product releases we tend to have significant levels of backlog but at other times backlog is minimal and we normally ship products within a few days of receiving an order because of this fluctuation in backlog we believe that backlog is not a reliable predictor of our future desktop software sales internetbased products and services intuit’s data centers house most of the systems networks and databases required to operate and deliver our internetbased products and services such as turbotax for the web electronic tax filing quickbooks assisted payroll and quickencom through our data centers we connect customers to products and services and we store the vast amount of data that represents the content on our web sites our data centers consist of approximately 2200 servers and 400 databases located primarily in three locations in an effort to reduce unavailability or “down time” for our internetbased products and services we generally follow industrystandard practices for creating a faulttolerant environment but we do not have complete redundancy despite our efforts to maintain continuous and reliable server operations like all providers of internetbased products and services we occasionally experience unplanned outages or technical difficulties see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — risks that could affect future results” privacy and security of customer information customers are concerned about the privacy and security of information they provide to product and services providers this concern applies to information they provide in connection with internetbased products and services as well as information they provide through more traditional channels such as 14 product registration cards primarily because of the financial nature of the information customers provide to us we are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations relating to privacy and security including laws and regulations that require us to disclose certain information to customers we are also subject to laws and regulations that apply to telemarketing activities additional laws of this type are likely to be passed in the future which could result in significant increased compliance costs for us see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — risks that could affect future results” 

we have established guidelines and practices to help ensure that customers are aware of and can control how we use information about them all publiclyaccessible intuitowned and operated web sites at which customer data is collected including quickencom quickbookscom and turbotaxcom have been certified by truste an independent nonprofit privacy organization that operates a web site certification program to alleviate users’ concerns about online privacy each of our web sites as well as our software products has a privacy statement providing notice to customers of our privacy practices as well as providing them the opportunity to furnish instructions with respect to use of their data to address security concerns we use industrystandard security safeguards to help protect the information customers give to us from loss misuse and unauthorized alteration whenever customers transmit sensitive information such as a credit card number or tax return data to us through our web site we provide them access to our servers that allow encryption of the information as it is transmitted to us we work to protect personally identifiable information stored on the web site’s servers from unauthorized access using commercially available computer security products such as firewalls as well as internally developed security procedures and practices we believe privacy and security issues pose a significant risk to intuit and other companies especially companies doing business over the internet although we have made significant efforts to address customer concerns through our business practices during the past few years we have faced lawsuits and negative publicity relating to privacy issues our response to these allegations has been that we do not share any personally identifiable information except as disclosed in our privacy policies a major breach of customer privacy or security even by another company could have serious consequences for our businesses see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — risks that could affect future results” and “legal proceedings” government regulation we offer several products and services that are subject to special regulatory requirements for example the brokeragerelated services that intuit offers through quicken brokerage powered by siebert are provided in part by an intuit subsidiary that is registered as a securities broker and is subject to certain federal and state brokerdealer regulations in addition some of the investmentrelated features in our products and services are offered by an intuit subsidiary that is registered as an investment adviser with the sec and is subject to some state regulatory laws as well as we expand the depth and breadth of our small business offerings we may become subject to additional government regulation particularly in the areas of retirement planning and other employer services we continually analyze new business opportunities and new businesses that we pursue may require additional costs for regulatory compliance current government regulation poses a number of risks to us including potential liability to customers andor penalties and sanctions by government regulators future regulation could hamper the growth of our businesses see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — risks that could affect future results” intellectual property we rely on a combination of copyright patent trademark and trade secret laws and employee and thirdparty nondisclosure and license agreements to protect our software products and other proprietary technology while our proprietary technology is important we believe our success depends more heavily on 15 the innovation and technical skills of our employees we do not own all of the software and other technologies used in our products and services but we have the licenses from third parties that we believe are necessary and appropriate for using that technology in our current products 

we consider our principal trademarks including intuit quickbooks turbotax and quicken to be important assets and have registered these and other trademarks and service marks in the us and many foreign countries the initial duration of trademark registrations varies from country to country and is 10 years in the us most registrations can be renewed perpetually at 10year intervals we face a number of risks relating to our intellectual property including persistent unauthorized use and unauthorized copying or “piracy” of our desktop software products although we have recently begun to incorporate technology in certain desktop software products to reduce unauthorized use we expect piracy to be a persistent problem we also face the risk of third parties claiming that our products or services infringe their intellectual property rights and we face risks to the value of our brands when we grant trademark licenses to third parties see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — risks that could affect future results” employees as of august 31 2002 we had approximately 6500 employees located primarily in the united states canada japan and the united kingdom we believe our future success and growth will depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees in all areas of our business we do not currently have any collective bargaining agreements with our employees and we believe employee relations are generally good although we have employmentrelated agreements with a number of key employees these agreements do not guarantee continued service we believe we offer competitive compensation and a good working environment we were selected as one of fortune magazine’s “100 best companies to work for” in april 2002 however we face intense competition for qualified employees and we expect to face continuing challenges in recruiting and retention

intuit is subject to other routine legal proceedings as well as demands claims and threatened litigation that arise in the normal course of our business we currently believe that the ultimate amount of liability if any for any pending claims of any type either alone or combined will not materially affect our financial position results of operations or liquidity however the ultimate outcome of any litigation is uncertain and either unfavorable or favorable outcomes could have a material negative impact regardless of outcome litigation can have an adverse impact on intuit because of defense costs diversion of management resources and other factors

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition 

and results of operations 

note for a more complete understanding of our financial condition and results of operations and some of the risks that could affect future results see “risks that could affect future results” in this item 7 this section should also be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes in item 8 as discussed below we sold our quicken loans mortgage business and accounted for the sale as discontinued operations unless otherwise noted the following discussion pertains only to our continuing operations results of operations threeyear total net revenue and net income loss trends the following table shows trends in our total net revenue and net income loss for the past three years net income loss is shown in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” and also on an unaudited company pro forma basis we present this company pro forma financial information as a supplement to but not a substitute for gaap information in order to provide investors with an alternative way of assessing our results company pro forma information is different from certain pro forma figures required to be presented in our consolidated financial statements and notes  24 reconciliation of gaap net income loss to pro forma net income the following table presents the reconciliation of gaap net income loss to unaudited company pro forma net income for the periods shown company pro forma information is prepared using the same consistent method from quarter to quarter and year to year company pro forma net income excludes acquisitionrelated charges such as amortization of goodwill and intangibles and impairment charges and amortization of purchased software and charges for purchased research and development it also excludes loss on impairment of longlived asset gains and losses from marketable securities and other investments net gains and losses on divestitures discontinued operations the cumulative effect of an accounting change see note 1 of the financial statements and the tax effects of these transactions  overview intuit’s mission is to revolutionize how people manage their financial lives and how small businesses and accounting professionals manage their businesses our goal is to create changes so profound customers wouldn’t dream of going back to their old ways of keeping their books doing their taxes or managing their personal finances intuit is a leading provider of small business tax preparation and personal finance software products and services that simplify complex financial tasks for small businesses consumers and accounting professionals our principal products and services include small business accounting and business management solutions including our quickbooks® line of products and services as well as our intuit® line of industryspecific business management solutions turbotax® consumer tax products and services proseries® and lacerte® professional tax products and services and quicken® personal finance products and services the business models for many of our products and services provide us with significant profit leverage for three primary reasons first these businesses have relatively high fixed costs and low variable costs so as we increase units sold we generate more profit per incremental unit sold second as we offer products and services with greater functionality we can increase prices to reflect the greater value that we deliver to customers third as customers move to some of our higherend products and services the better product and service mix is resulting in more revenue and profit per customer our tax businesses are highly seasonal sales of tax preparation products and services are heavily concentrated in the period from november through april these seasonal patterns mean that our total net revenue is usually highest during our second and third quarters ending january 31 and april 30 we 25 typically report losses in our first and fourth quarters ending october 31 and july 31 when revenue from our tax businesses are minimal but operating expenses to develop new products and services continue at relatively consistent levels 

acquisitions and dispositions of businesses and assets have had a significant impact on the comparability of our results year over year during the past three years we have completed several acquisitions and dispositions in fiscal 2002 we sold our quicken loans mortgage business and accounted for the sale as discontinued operations see notes 9 10 and 11 of the financial statements the impairment of goodwill and other intangibles received in connection with acquisitions has also had a significant impact on our operating results during fiscal 2001 and 2002 we recorded charges of 787 million and 273 million for impairment of goodwill and intangible assets total goodwill amortization expense including impairments was 1395 million in fiscal 2001 and 1226 million in fiscal 2002 we adopted statement of financial standards “sfas” no 142 on august 1 2002 the adoption of this standard will eliminate the amortization of goodwill commencing with the first quarter of fiscal 2003 however it is possible that in the future we may incur impairment charges related to existing goodwill as well as to goodwill arising out of future acquisitions see notes 1 and 5 of the financial statements for more information regarding our goodwill and intangible assets and the impact of impairment charges on our reported net income gains and losses related to marketable securities and other investments have had a significant impact on the comparability of our yearly results as well all of our marketable securities and longterm investments are holdings in high technology companies that have been extremely volatile since we purchased them in fiscal 2001 and 2002 the market prices of a number of these companies’ securities declined substantially from our initial investment due to the economic downturn in the high technology industry during fiscal 2001 and 2002 we recorded charges of 688 million and 95 million for otherthantemporary declines in the value of our availableforsale marketable securities and other investments and a charge of 400 million during fiscal 2001 relating to the decline in the valuation of our trading securities see note 3 of the financial statements for more information regarding our investments in marketable securities and the impact of our trading securities on our reported net income critical accounting policies in preparing our financial statements we make estimates assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on our net revenue operating income and net income as well as on the value of certain assets on our balance sheet we believe that the estimates assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies see note 1 of the financial statements for more information about these critical accounting policies as well as descriptions of other significant accounting policies  26  27  28 total net revenue the table below shows total net revenue and percentage of total net revenue for each of our business segments for fiscal years 2000 2001 and 2002 we have reclassified prior year information to conform to the current year financial presentation for comparability see note 14 of the financial statements for additional information about our business segments  nm is a nonmeaningful comparison 29 fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 total net revenue for fiscal 2002 was 13583 million compared to 11484 million in fiscal 2001 representing an increase of 18 the fiscal 2002 increase in net revenue was primarily due to growth of 31 in our employer services segment 29 in our consumer tax segment and 20 in our professional accounting solutions segments net revenue from our small business segment increased 14 due to growth in quickbooksrelated products personal finance net revenue declined 9 in fiscal 2002 reflecting a decrease in internet advertising revenue and lower sales of quicken due to the continuing overall decline in the personal finance desktop software category fiscal 2001 compared to fiscal 2000 total net revenue for fiscal 2001 was 11484 million compared to 10373 million in fiscal 2000 representing an increase of 11 our consumer tax segment had a strong year with an increase of 26 that was driven by webbased tax return preparation and electronic tax return filing services revenue which more than doubled from fiscal 2000 the revenue growth also reflected a 57 increase in our employer services segment growth in these segments was partially offset by a 16 decline in the personal finance segment personal finance was adversely affected by the declining demand for internet advertising as well as by lower sales of quicken due to an overall decline in the personal finance desktop software category total net revenue by business segment the following net revenue discussion is categorized by our business segments which reflect how we manage our operations and how our chief operating decision maker views results the net revenue impact of the fiscal 2001 acquisition of tax and accounting software corporation is discussed below under professional accounting solutions no other acquisitions have had a material impact on net revenue in the periods presented small business small business product revenue is derived primarily from quickbooks desktop software products and financial supplies small business services revenue is derived primarily from quickbooks service solutions our fee for support plan our small business verticals businesses are managed separately from the small business segment so their revenue is included in the small business verticals and other segment below fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 small business total net revenue increased 14 in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 total quickbooksrelated revenue which includes quickbooks desktop software products quickbooks support plans quickbooks internet gateway and quickbooks online edition was 11 higher while quickbooks desktop product revenue alone grew 19 the increase in quickbooks desktop product revenue reflected higher average selling prices driven primarily by the november 2001 launch of our higherpriced quickbooks premier products as well as 12 higher unit sales the volume increase was driven by strong upgrade sales which we believe were due in part to our decision to discontinue technical support and tax table services during calendar 2002 for customers using certain older versions of quickbooks we believe that the availability of a range of third party offerings from the intuit developer network to quickbooks 2002 customers may also have contributed to the stronger upgrade sales fiscal 2002 quickbooksrelated revenue growth also reflected strong results from quickbooks service solutions in august 2001 we began offering several higherend support plans which resulted in significantly higher average selling prices that more than offset declines in volume compared to fiscal 2001 revenue growth in quickbooksrelated products and services was partially offset by a decline in quickbooks internet gateway revenue revenue for this business decreased due to a sharp decline in upfront fees received from internet gateway participants as well as a decrease in transactionbased fees that reflects lower customer demand for internet gateway services and fewer services being offered financial supplies revenue increased modestly during the year we expect continued growth in our small business segment in fiscal 2003 we expect quickbooksrelated revenue to increase due to the fiscal 2002 introduction of products with more advanced functionality such as quickbooks premier quickbooks premier accountant edition and quickbooks enterprise solutions 30 business management software which have significantly higher selling prices than our other quickbooks products 

fiscal 2001 compared to fiscal 2000 for fiscal 2001 total net revenue for the small business segment increased 6 over fiscal 2000 revenue from quickbooks desktop products remained relatively flat while average selling prices increased for the year unit sales declined 17 this was attributable to a decline in the rate at which existing quickbooks customers upgraded to newer quickbooks products as well as to a lower acquisition rate of new users product revenue from our financial supplies and services revenue from our quickbooks internet gateway and quickbooks service solutions increased in fiscal 2001 employer services employer services product revenue is derived primarily from our quickbooks doityourself payroll formerly basic payroll offering employer services services revenue is derived primarily from our quickbooks assisted payroll service formerly deluxe payroll and intuit payroll services — complete payroll formerly premier payroll fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 employer services total net revenue increased 31 in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 reflecting 39 combined growth for the quickbooksbranded doityourself payroll and assisted payroll service offerings with revenue for the intuit payroll services — complete payroll service roughly flat price increases accounted for a significant portion of the doityourself payroll and assisted payroll service revenue growth although the number of customers for the combined offerings also increased by approximately 12 we expect total net revenue to continue to increase in our employer services business in fiscal 2003 due in part to the acquisition of cbs employer services inc a provider of fullservice outsourced payroll functions for small businesses in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 fiscal 2001 compared to fiscal 2000 employer services total net revenue increased 57 for fiscal 2001 compared to fiscal 2000 increases in our average selling prices for both our doityourself payroll offering and our assisted payroll service contributed to this growth the higher average selling prices resulted from price increases as well as a shift toward a mix of higherpriced products the number of customers for the combined offerings also grew approximately 7 consumer tax consumer tax product revenue is derived primarily from turbotax federal and state consumer desktop tax preparation products consumer tax services revenue is derived primarily from turbotax for the web online tax preparation services and electronic filing services fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 consumer tax total net revenue increased 29 in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 revenue from turbotax desktop products was up 10 due primarily to higher average selling prices resulting from the introduction of a higherpriced premium product revenue from turbotax for the web was strong in fiscal 2002 reflecting a significant increase in the mix of higherend service offerings turbotax premier as well as 84 unit growth electronic filing units and revenue also contributed to the yearoveryear growth overall our consumer tax customer base grew 19 in fiscal 2002 fiscal 2001 compared to fiscal 2000 for fiscal 2001 consumer tax total net revenue increased approximately 26 compared to fiscal 2000 the increase was due to a combination of higher average selling prices resulting from price increases as well as improved product mix and increased unit sales for both our desktop products and webbased tax preparation services our consumer tax business also benefited from microsoft’s discontinuation of its desktop consumer tax preparation software after the 1999 tax season which ended april 15 2000 our webbased tax preparation and electronic filing services also experienced strong growth during fiscal 2001 webbased tax preparation revenue more than doubled from fiscal 2000 as a result of increased prices as well as a 71 increase in unit volume in addition our 31 electronic filing services revenue increased 53 overall our consumer tax customer base grew 14 in fiscal 2001 

we expect continued growth in our consumer tax business in fiscal 2003 due to the continuing upward trend in consumer use of the web for tax return preparation and filing we also expect revenue growth as a result of product activation features to be included in the tax year 2002 federal versions of turbotax desktop products for windows® which are designed to reduce unauthorized sharing of those products professional accounting solutions professional accounting solutions product revenue is derived primarily from proseries and lacerte professional tax preparation products professional accounting solutions services revenue is derived primarily from electronic filing and tax advice services fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 total net revenue from our professional tax preparation products and services increased 20 in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 approximately 210 million or 11 of the growth compared to fiscal 2001 resulted from our acquisition of tax and accounting software corporation in april 2001 higher revenue from electronic filing services was also a significant factor in the increase our fiscal 2002 introduction of product activation technology that restricted sharing of professional tax products and higher average selling prices for our proseries and lacerte unlimiteduse products also contributed to the revenue growth renewal rates for our existing customer base remained strong during fiscal 2002 fiscal 2001 compared to fiscal 2000 total net revenue from our professional tax preparation products and services increased 10 in fiscal 2001 compared to fiscal 2000 this growth resulted from higher average selling prices for both our proseries and lacerte unlimiteduse products and unit growth for our payper return customers renewal rates for our existing customer base were strong during fiscal 2001 we expect continued growth in our professional accounting solutions business in fiscal 2003 but we expect the rate of growth to slow compared to fiscal 2002 fiscal 2002 growth rates for this business were unusually high due to the acquisition of taasc in late fiscal 2001 personal finance personal finance product revenue is derived primarily from quicken desktop products personal finance services revenue is minimal other revenue consists of quickencom advertising revenue and royalties for online transactions fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 personal finance total net revenue decreased 9 in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 due primarily to a 15 decline in revenue from quicken desktop products and a 38 decline in quickencom revenue solid growth in our online transactions business partially offset these declines the decrease in quicken revenue reflected the continuing overall decline in the personal finance desktop software category our share of retail units in this category remained above 70 in fiscal 2002 the decrease in quickencom advertising revenue reflected the industrywide decline in spending by purchasers of internet advertising we expect these trends to continue in fiscal 2003 fiscal 2001 compared to fiscal 2000 total net revenue from the personal finance segment decreased 16 in fiscal 2001 compared to fiscal 2000 this decline in revenue was attributable in part to a 27 decline in unit sales for our quicken desktop products and a 31 decline in our quickencom internet advertising revenues quicken revenue was down due to an overall decline in the personal finance desktop software category advertising revenue declined compared to the prior year due to the overall economic environment which resulted in reduced advertising spending by purchasers of internet advertising we experienced continued growth in our online transactions business which partially offset these declines 32 global business global business product revenue is derived primarily from quickbooks quicken and quicktax desktop software products in canada and yayoi small business desktop accounting products in japan global business services revenue primarily consists of revenue from software maintenance contracts sold with yayoi software in japan fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 global business total net revenue increased 10 in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 revenue from canada increased 29 year over year this reflected strong tax season results for quicktax due in part to the preliminary success of our efforts to reduce unauthorized sharing of desktop software canadian tax revenue growth was partially offset by modest revenue declines for quickbooks and quicken revenue in japan declined 12 compared to fiscal 2001 japan’s product revenue decreased 17 due primarily to our discontinuation of the quickbooks product line in japan in the second quarter of fiscal 2002 revenue from yayoi products was roughly flat compared to fiscal 2001 the overall decline in japan’s product revenue was partially offset by increased revenue from yayoi support contracts fiscal 2001 compared to fiscal 2000 global division total net revenue for fiscal 2001 increased 4 compared to fiscal 2000 this increase was primarily due to 39 overall revenue growth in canada which was driven by 45 growth in quickbooks revenue in addition canada experienced 14 growth in professional tax revenue as a result of an acquisition we made early in fiscal 2001 revenue in japan increased due to higher retail sales of our yayoi small business accounting software this was partially offset by declining sales of quickbooks in japan as well as decreased royalties and an adverse foreign exchange rate impact that resulted in lower average selling prices in us dollars small business verticals and other as part of our right for my business strategy in fiscal 2002 we acquired several companies that enable us to provide accounting and business management solutions to customers in selected industries which we refer to as “verticals” these new businesses which we report as a single business segment include the following intuit construction business solutions formerly omware inc which provides business management software for the construction industry intuit public sector solutions formerly the flagship group which offers accounting and business management software solutions for nonprofit organizations universities and government agencies intuit mri real estate solutions formerly management reports inc which provides business management software for commercial and residential property managers and intuit eclipse distribution management solutions formerly eclipse inc which offers business management software for the wholesale durable goods industry three of the four acquisitions were completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 as a result total net revenue from the small business vertical and other segment was not significant in fiscal 2002 and consisted primarily of revenue generated by omware inc there was no significant revenue in this segment from sources other than the acquired vertical businesses during fiscal 2002 driving the growth of the vertical businesses we have acquired so far and acquiring additional vertical businesses are key business initiatives for fiscal 2003 therefore we expect that we will continue to report these businesses as a separate business segment in the future 33 

 

  there are four components of our cost of revenue 1 cost of products which includes the direct cost of manufacturing and shipping desktop software products 2 cost of services which reflects direct costs associated with providing services including data center costs relating to delivering internetbased services 3 cost of other revenue which includes costs associated with generating advertising and marketing and online transactions revenue and 4 amortization of purchased software which represents the cost of depreciating products we obtained through acquisitions over their useful lives fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 cost of products as a percentage of product revenue decreased slightly to 16 in fiscal 2002 from 17 in fiscal 2001 we lowered our perunit materials manufacturing and shipping costs for our shrinkwrap software products resulting in significant cost savings these savings were nearly offset by increased costs associated with improving our product distribution function during the first quarter of fiscal 2002 we established a new thirdparty retail distribution relationship for our shrinkwrap software products this distribution relationship enables us to ship a larger percentage of our products directly to individual retail stores and allows us to provide inventory to our retail customers on a more timely basis by providing better service to our retailers we are reducing product returns and related costs because of this and because we plan to continue redesigning the packaging for many of our software products and further streamlining our manufacturing processes we expect cost of products as a percentage of product revenue to decline in fiscal 2003 cost of services as a percentage of services revenue decreased to 37 in fiscal 2002 from 46 in fiscal 2001 this decrease was attributable primarily to our payroll and webbased tax businesses which experienced significant revenue growth with relatively fixed cost bases cost of other revenue as a percentage of other revenue increased to 39 in fiscal 2002 compared to 35 in fiscal 2001 this increase was primarily due to increased data center costs related to our personal finance segment’s online transaction business which experienced revenue growth in fiscal 2002 amortization of purchased software decreased slightly in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 this reflected lower amortization expense in the second half of fiscal 2002 that resulted from a lower base of assets to be amortized this decline was partially offset by impairment charges for certain purchased software assets that were recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2002 which caused the decrease in the base of assets see note 5 of the financial statements fiscal 2001 compared to fiscal 2000 cost of products as a percentage of product revenue decreased to 17 for fiscal 2001 compared to 20 for fiscal 2000 the decline was primarily attributable to lower excess and obsolete inventory expenses for all of our product lines due to improved inventory management cost of services as a percentage of services revenue decreased to 46 for fiscal 2001 compared to 51 for fiscal 2000 due primarily to revenue growth in our payroll business with a relatively fixed cost base this factor was partially offset by increased data center costs related to our personal finance segment’s online transactions businesses cost of other revenue as a percentage of other revenue increased to 35 for fiscal 2001 compared to 34 for fiscal 2000 due to a significant decrease in internet advertising revenue with a relatively fixed cost base 34 

 

  customer service and technical support fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 customer service and technical support expenses were 13 of total net revenue in fiscal 2002 and 2001 we improved our efficiency in fiscal 2002 by increasing the proportion of customer service and technical support we provide through less expensive methods such as web sites online chat email and other electronic means we also implemented a number of successful process excellence initiatives that reduced costs while maintaining or increasing service levels however these benefits were more than offset by higher direct sales and support costs associated with converting the customers of tax accounting and software company a company that we acquired in april 2001 to our proseries and lacerte professional tax products and by increased demand for customer service and technical support due to our growing customer base we expect customer service and technical support expenses to decrease slightly as a percentage of total net revenue in fiscal 2003 as taasc conversion costs gradually decline and as we continue to benefit from lower cost more scalable electronic customer service and technical support delivery mechanisms fiscal 2001 compared to fiscal 2000 customer service and technical support expenses were flat at 13 of total net revenue in fiscal 2001 and 2000 this reflected the benefit of providing an increased proportion of customer service and technical support more efficiently and less expensively through web sites and other electronic means and from the expansion of quickbooks service solutions our fee for support program for quickbooks customers these improvements were offset by the april 2001 start of support costs to convert customers of our newly acquired taasc business to our proseries and lacerte professional tax products selling and marketing fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 selling and marketing expenses were 21 of total net revenue in fiscal 2002 compared to 20 in fiscal 2001 in fiscal 2002 selling and marketing expenses increased as we expanded our small business marketing programs to support the right for my business strategy announced in september 2001 we also incurred incremental marketing expenses for our construction business solutions products which we acquired in november 2001 these increases were partially offset by a decrease in selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of total net revenue for our payroll business due to significant revenue growth in that segment we also donated 80 million to the intuit foundation in fiscal 2002 which will be used to benefit the community through contributions to selected nonprofit 35 organizations we expect selling and marketing expenses to continue to increase as a percentage of total net revenue in fiscal 2003 as we expand marketing programs for our new quickbooks products as well as for the right for my business products and services we recently introduced and those we expect to introduce in fiscal 2003 

fiscal 2001 compared to fiscal 2000 selling and marketing expenses were 20 of total net revenue in fiscal 2001 compared to 21 in fiscal 2000 during fiscal 2000 we experienced relatively higher sales and marketing expenses in the first half of the year due to aggressive marketing programs to expand our internetbased businesses and to respond to microsoft’s taxsaver consumer tax offering in fiscal 2001 our payroll business also experienced relatively lower marketing expenditures as it continued to benefit from the marketing value of the intuit brand research and development fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 during fiscal 2002 we increased research and development spending in some of our highestgrowth businesses — small business consumer tax and professional tax — by approximately 10 in particular we continued to invest in our right for my business strategy including new quickbooks premier point of sale and enterprise products launched in the second quarter of fiscal 2002 the intuit developer network and other new products that we expect to introduce in fiscal 2003 at the same time we significantly decreased or stopped spending in less strategic areas and discontinued product lines we also benefited from improvements in our development process that resulted in shorter development times and higher quality for our new quickbooks products the net result was that research and development expenses in fiscal 2002 were flat in absolute dollars and declined as a percentage of total net revenue to 15 of total net revenue compared to 18 in fiscal 2001 during fiscal 2003 we expect to continue to make significant investments in research and development particularly for new small business products and services fiscal 2001 compared to fiscal 2000 for fiscal 2001 research and development expenses were 18 of total net revenue in 2001 compared to 16 of total net revenue in fiscal 2000 in both fiscal 2001 and 2000 we invested significant amounts in our services businesses mostly focused in our small business and employer services segments this included research and development efforts for quickbooks online edition our quickbooks assisted payroll service formerly deluxe payroll our quickbase® information management tool and the intuit developer network general and administrative fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 general and administrative expenses were 8 of total net revenue in fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001 we experienced increased directors’ and officers’ liability insurance costs and costs associated with integrating our acquisitions of omware inc in november 2001 and employeematters inc in december 2000 these increases were offset by decreases in bad debt charges in fiscal 2002 we had relatively high accounts receivable writeoffs in fiscal 2001 due to the deteriorating financial condition of many internet companies with whom we did business we expect general and administrative expenses to increase as a percentage of total net revenue in fiscal 2003 due to the costs of integrating our fourth quarter fiscal 2002 acquisitions and other acquisitions we expect to make in fiscal 2003 as well as to investments in our internal audit function and process excellence infrastructure we also expect bad debt expense for fiscal 2003 to be somewhat higher than for fiscal 2002 because we experienced unusually low levels of bad debt expense in fiscal 2002 fiscal 2001 compared to fiscal 2000 general and administrative expenses were 8 of total net revenue for fiscal 2001 compared to 7 of total net revenue for fiscal 2000 during fiscal 2001 we experienced an increase in our bad debt expense related to the economic downturn in the high technology industry that impacted many companies with whom we did business our general and administrative expense for fiscal 2001 also included an increase of 12 million in deferred compensation amortization expense related to restricted stock we granted when we hired our president and chief executive officer in january 2000 36 charge for purchased research and development in connection with certain acquisitions and with the assistance of thirdparty appraisers we determine the value of inprocess projects under development for which technological feasibility has not been established the value of the projects is determined by estimating the costs to develop the inprocess technology into commercially feasible products estimating the net cash flows we believe would result from the products and discounting these net cash flows back to their present value the resulting amount is recorded as a charge for purchased research and development when we acquire certain new businesses in fiscal 2002 we recorded a charge of 22 million for purchased research and development as a result of our acquisition of management reports inc now intuit mri real estate solutions in fiscal 2001 we recorded a charge of 02 million for purchased research and development when we acquired tax accounting and software corporation we recorded 13 million for purchased research and development as a result of our boston light software corporation and hutchison avenue software corporation acquisitions in fiscal 2000 although we intend to continue to acquire relatively mature businesses with products whose technological feasibility has been demonstrated as part of our right for my business strategy it is possible that we will incur additional charges for purchased research and development in the future charge for vacant facilities during the third quarter of fiscal 2002 we concluded that we would not occupy two vacant leased buildings in mountain view california and that we would be unable to recover a substantial portion of our lease obligations by subleasing the vacant space as a result we recorded a charge of 132 million see note 13 of the financial statements acquisitionrelated charges acquisitionrelated charges include the amortization of goodwill purchased intangible assets and deferred compensation expenses arising from acquisitions and impairment charges relating to certain acquired assets see note 5 of the financial statements the fasb recently adopted a new standard for accounting for goodwill acquired in a business combination it continues to require us to recognize goodwill as an asset whenever we pay more for a business than the total of its net tangible and intangible assets but it does not permit us to amortize goodwill which we were previously required to do under the new statement we must separately test goodwill for impairment using a fairvaluebased approach on an annual basis or more frequently if an event occurs indicating potential impairment the shift from an amortization approach to an impairment approach applies to all acquisitions completed after june 30 2001 the additional goodwill amortization charge for businesses we acquired after june 30 2001 would have been approximately 88 million in fiscal 2002 had this new standard not been in place we will adopt the remaining elements of this new standard in the first quarter of fiscal 2003 and will therefore cease goodwill amortization for acquisitions we made prior to july 1 2001 however it is possible that in the future we may incur impairment charges related to the goodwill already recorded and to goodwill arising out of future acquisitions in addition we will continue to amortize most purchased intangible assets and to assess those assets for impairment as appropriate in accordance with the new standard we transferred the balance of 19 million for assembled workforce at august 1 2002 to goodwill and will no longer amortize that asset see note 1 of the financial statements fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 in fiscal 2002 acquisitionrelated charges were 1816 million compared to 2482 million in fiscal 2001 acquisitionrelated charges in fiscal 2002 included impairment charges totaling 220 million that were related to our internetbased advertising business and our site solutions business see notes 1 and 5 of the financial statements acquisitionrelated charges in fiscal 2002 also reflected an increase of 127 million in amortization of intangibles associated with the acquisitions of employeematters inc in december 2000 and tax accounting and software corporation in 37 april 2001 acquisitionrelated charges for fiscal 2001 included impairment charges that totaled 787 million 

fiscal 2001 compared to fiscal 2000 in fiscal 2001 acquisitionrelated charges were 2482 million compared to 1564 million in fiscal 2000 the increase was primarily attributable to impairment charges totaling 787 million that were recorded in the second half of fiscal 2001 during our review for impairment events and circumstances indicated possible impairment of goodwill and intangible assets related to our acquisitions of venture finance software corp securetaxcom and hutchison avenue software corporation see notes 1 and 5 of the financial statements based on our analysis we recorded impairment charges of 510 million 260 million and 17 million associated with vfsc securetax and hutchison respectively loss on impairment of longlived asset the fiscal 2002 loss on impairment of longlived asset related to the impairment of the asset we received from the purchaser of our quicken bill manager business in may 2001 we regularly perform reviews to determine if the carrying values of our longlived assets are impaired during the first quarter of fiscal 2002 events and circumstances indicated impairment of this asset based on our resulting analysis of the asset’s fair value we recorded a charge of 270 million to reduce the carrying value of this asset to its estimated fair value of zero reflecting the deteriorating financial condition of the purchasing company see note 12 of the financial statements nonoperating income and expenses interest and other income in fiscal 2002 interest and other income decreased to 329 million compared to 573 million in fiscal 2001 and 485 million in fiscal 2000 the decrease during fiscal 2002 was due to a sharp decline in the interest we earned on our cash and shortterm investment balances in fiscal 2002 reflecting significant decreases in market interest rates during the period the increase during fiscal 2001 resulted from higher average cash and shortterm investment balances due in part to sales of marketable securities as well as more cash generated from operations compared to fiscal 2000 the total fiscal 2001 increase was partially offset by the effect of lower market interest rates compared to fiscal 2000 interest earned on customer payroll deposits is reported as revenue for our payroll business and is not included in interest and other income gains losses on marketable securities and other investments net as of july 31 2002 we held marketable securities and longterm investments in privately held companies carried at 236 million on our balance sheet this balance was down from 1094 million as of july 31 2001 due to sales and writedowns we review the values of our investments each quarter and make adjustments as appropriate see notes 1 and 3 of the financial statements the steep decline in equity markets over the past few years has significantly reduced the value of our marketable securities and longterm investments if the value of these remaining securities continues to decline in the future it would have a negative impact on our financial results we considered our shares of excitehome and 724 solutions common stock to be trading securities as a result unrealized gains or losses due to market fluctuations in these securities were included in our net income or loss on a quarterly basis until we sold them in the first quarter of fiscal 2002 we considered our other marketable securities to be availableforsale and did not reflect quarterly fluctuations in their value in our net income or loss on a quarterly basis unless we concluded that a decline in value was otherthantemporary see note 3 of the financial statements we recorded pretax net losses relating to marketable securities and other investments of 155 million in fiscal 2002 and 981 million in fiscal 2001 in fiscal 2000 we recorded a pretax gain relating to marketable securities and other investments of 4811 million see note 3 of the financial statements the 38 fiscal 2002 net loss included charges totaling 95 million to write down certain longterm investments for which the decline in fair value below carrying value was otherthantemporary our fiscal 2001 net loss included charges of 402 million to write down certain availableforsale securities for which the decline in fair value below carrying value was otherthantemporary and 286 million to write down certain longterm investments for which the decline in fair value below carrying value was otherthantemporary the fiscal 2000 net gain resulted primarily from our sales of checkfree signio now verisign and homestorecom common stock 

net gains losses on divestitures in march 2002 we paid 120 million to terminate our 203 million obligation under an interactive services agreement related to our quicken bill manager business which we sold in may 2001 when we terminated the interactive services agreement we recorded a pretax gain of 83 million see note 10 of the financial statements in the first quarter of fiscal 2002 we wrote off the 270 million asset acquired from the purchaser of our quicken bill manager business to loss on impairment of longlived asset in our statement of operations see note 12 of the financial statements during fiscal 2001 we recorded a pretax net loss of 153 million resulting from our divestitures of businesses during the second quarter of fiscal 2001 we realized a pretax net gain of 16 million for the sale of certain assets of our wholly owned subsidiary intuit insurance services inc which operated our quicken insurance business the gain was more than offset by a pretax net loss of 169 million for the sale of the technology assets of our quicken bill manager business in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001 see note 10 of the financial statements neither of these divestitures represented discontinued operations income tax benefit provision for fiscal 2002 we recorded an income tax provision of 152 million on pretax income from continuing operations of 849 million resulting in an effective tax rate of approximately 18 for fiscal 2001 we recorded an income tax benefit of 125 million on a pretax loss from continuing operations of 1306 million resulting in an effective rate of approximately 10 for fiscal 2000 we recorded an income tax provision of 2166 million on pretax income of 5387 million resulting in an effective tax rate of approximately 40 our effective tax rate for fiscal 2002 differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to a tax benefit related to a divestiture that became available during the year and taxexempt interest income offset by nondeductible merger related charges our effective tax rate for fiscal 2001 differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the net effect of nondeductible merger and divestiture related charges offset by the benefit we received from taxexempt interest income our effective tax rate for fiscal 2000 differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the net effect of nondeductible merger charges offset by the benefit received from taxexempt interest income as of july 31 2002 we had net deferred tax assets of 2444 million which included a valuation allowance of 93 million for net operating loss carryforwards relating to our international subsidiaries and certain state capital loss carryforwards the allowance reflects management’s assessment that we may not receive the benefit of certain loss carryforwards of our international subsidiaries and capital loss carryforwards in certain state jurisdictions while we believe our current valuation allowance is sufficient it may be necessary to increase this amount if it becomes more likely that we will not realize a greater portion of the net deferred tax assets we assess the need for an adjustment to the valuation allowance on a quarterly basis see note 20 of the financial statements discontinued operations we acquired the quicken loans business in december 1999 in a transaction that was accounted for as a pooling of interests accordingly we did not record any goodwill or other intangible assets on july 31 2002 we sold our quicken loans mortgage business segment and received consideration in the form of a fiveyear interest bearing promissory note in the principal amount of 233 million this amount exceeded the net shareholders’ equity of quicken loans by 233 million we accounted for the 39 sale as discontinued operations in accordance with apb no 30 the operating results of quicken loans have been segregated from continuing operations in our statements of operations for fiscal years 2000 2001 and 2002 and are shown on a single line captioned net income loss from quicken loans discontinued operations the sale resulted in a pretax gain of 233 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 we did not record the tax benefit related to the gain on the transaction because we cannot be assured that we will realize the tax benefit see note 11 of the financial statements 

concurrent with the sale we signed an agreement to license the quicken loans brand and a distribution agreement under which the purchasing company will provide mortgage services on quickencom we will receive minimum royalties of 18 million a year for the next five years under the licensing agreement and minimum fees of 08 million a year for the next five years under the distribution agreement royalties and fees under these agreements will be recorded as earned and included in other income on our statement of operations cumulative effect of accounting change during the first quarter of fiscal 2001 we recorded a cumulative gain of 143 million net of taxes as a result of a change in accounting principle when we adopted sfas 133 “accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities” we recognized the cumulative effect of the change in how we accounted for options to purchase shares of s1 corporation as of august 1 2000 see note 1 of the financial statements subsequent fluctuations in the fair value of these options were included in our net income or net loss until we sold them in the first quarter of fiscal 2002 liquidity and capital resources at july 31 2002 our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments totaled 12504 million a 368 million increase from july 31 2001 we generated 3582 million in cash from our operations during fiscal 2002 the primary components of cash provided by operations were net income from continuing operations of 698 million and adjustments made for noncash expenses including acquisitionrelated charges and amortization of purchased software of 1940 million depreciation charges of 599 million and an impairment loss on a longlived asset of 270 million we used 256 million in cash for investing activities during fiscal 2002 our primary use of cash was for business acquisitions which totaled 2783 million net of cash we acquired our shortterm investments decreased 3040 million during the fiscal year with proceeds of 315 billion from the sale upon maturity of certain shortterm investments partially offset by reinvestments of 285 billion as a result of our continued investment in information systems and infrastructure we also purchased property and equipment of 426 million and capitalized internal use software development projects of 213 million in fiscal 2002 we used 2105 million in cash for our financing activities in fiscal 2002 the primary component of cash used was 3184 million for the repurchase of treasury stock through our stock repurchase program see note 17 of the financial statements this was partially offset by proceeds of 1336 million we received from the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans in the normal course of business we enter into leases for new or expanded facilities in both domestic and global locations we also evaluate on an ongoing basis the merits of acquiring technology or businesses or establishing strategic relationships with and investing in other companies we may decide to use cash and cash equivalents to fund such activities in the future in may 2001 intuit’s board of directors authorized the company to repurchase up to 500 million of common stock over a threeyear period in july 2002 our board of directors increased the authorized purchase amount by 250 million the stock repurchase program is intended to help offset some of the dilution resulting from the issuance of shares under intuit’s employee stock plans at july 31 2002 we had repurchased a total of 3268 million of common stock since the inception of the program 40 in connection with the sale of our quicken loans mortgage business in july 2002 we have agreed to continue providing to the purchasing company an interestbearing line of credit of up to 3750 million to fund mortgage loans for a transition period of up to six months the line expires on january 31 2003 the line is secured by the related mortgage loans and had an outstanding balance of 2456 million at july 31 2002 see note 11 of the financial statements loans to executive officers and other employees totaled 129 million at july 31 2001 and 213 million at july 31 2002 loans to executive officers are primarily relocation loans and none of these were made or modified since july 31 2002 loans are generally interestbearing secured by real property and have maturity dates of up to 10 years see note 22 of the financial statements we believe that our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments will be sufficient to meet anticipated seasonal working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at july 31 2002  restricted cash july 31 2002 included 58 million that we held in escrow in connection with our fiscal 2002 acquisition of cbs employer services inc the escrow period expires in june 2003 restricted cash also included 55 million for rebates due our customers other obligations at july 31 2002 consisted primarily of amounts we owe to former stockholders of cbs employer services inc in connection with intuit’s acquisition of that company in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 this contractual obligation is included in other current liabilities on our balance sheet see notes 9 and 15 of the financial statements recent pronouncements on june 29 2001 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued sfas 141 “business combinations” and sfas 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” sfas 141 supercedes apb opinion no 16 “business combinations” and eliminates the poolingofinterests method of accounting for business combinations thus requiring that all business combinations be accounted for using the purchase method in addition in applying the purchase method sfas 141 changes the criteria for recognizing intangible assets other than goodwill and states that the following criteria should be considered in determining the classification of intangible assets 1 whether the intangible asset arises from contractual or other legal rights or 2 whether the intangible asset is separable or dividable from the acquired entity and capable of being sold transferred licensed rented or exchanged if neither criteria is met the intangible assets are classified as goodwill and are not amortized we have applied the requirements of sfas 141 to all business combinations initiated after june 30 2001 sfas 142 supercedes apb opinion no 17 “intangible assets” and provides that goodwill and other intangible assets that have an indefinite useful life will no longer be amortized however these assets must be reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently if an event occurs indicating the potential for impairment the shift from an amortization approach to an impairment approach applies to all 41 acquisitions completed after june 30 2001 the additional goodwill amortization charge for businesses we acquired subsequent to june 30 2001 would have been approximately 88 million in fiscal 2002 had this new standard not been in place total goodwill amortization expense including impairments was 1395 million in fiscal 2001 and 1226 million in fiscal 2002 we adopted the remaining elements of this new standard in the first quarter of fiscal 2003 and therefore ceased goodwill amortization for acquisitions made prior to july 1 2001 however it is possible that in the future we may incur impairment charges related to the goodwill already recorded and to goodwill arising out of future acquisitions in addition we will continue to amortize most purchased intangible assets and to assess those assets for impairment as appropriate 

in connection with the transitional goodwill impairment evaluation under sfas 142 we will perform an assessment of goodwill impairment as of august 1 2002 the date of adoption to accomplish this we will identify our reporting units and determine the carrying value of each of them by assigning the assets and liabilities including existing goodwill and intangible assets to those reporting units as of the date of adoption we will then have up to six months from the date of adoption to determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it to the reporting unit’s carrying amount to the extent that a reporting unit’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value an indication exists that the reporting unit’s goodwill may be impaired and we must perform the second step of the transitional impairment test in the second step we must compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill to its carrying amount both of which will be measured as of the date of adoption the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill is determined by allocating the reporting unit’s fair value to all of its assets recognized and unrecognized and liabilities in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation in accordance with sfas 141 this second step is required to be completed as soon as possible but no later than the end of the year of adoption any transitional impairment loss will be recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the statement of operations as of the date of adoption of sfas 142 on august 1 2002 we had an unamortized acquired intangible assets balance of approximately 1236 million excluding the balance of approximately 19 million for assembled workforce reclassified to goodwill as of that date we also had an unamortized goodwill balance of approximately 4308 million which included the amount of assembled workforce reclassified to goodwill these balances will be subject to the transitional provisions of sfas 141 and 142 transitional impairment losses that may be required to be recognized upon adoption of sfas 141 and 142 are indeterminable at this time in october 2001 the fasb issued sfas 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” which applies to financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2001 sfas 144 supersedes fasb statement 121 “accounting for the impairment of longlived assets and for longlived assets to be disposed of” and portions of apb opinion no 30 “reporting the results of operations” sfas 144 provides a single accounting model for longlived assets we expect to dispose of and significantly changes the criteria for classifying an asset as heldforsale this classification is important because heldforsale assets are not depreciated and are stated at the lower of fair value or carrying amount sfas 144 also requires expected future operating losses from discontinued operations to be displayed in the periods in which the losses are actually incurred rather than when the amount of the loss is estimated as presently required we adopted sfas 144 effective august 1 2002 and do not expect the adoption of sfas 144 to have a material impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows in november 2001 the fasb’s emerging issues task force released issue no 019 “accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer or a reseller of the vendor’s product” which applies to annual or interim financial statement periods beginning after december 15 2001 the release provides that cash consideration including sales incentives that we give to our customers or resellers should be accounted for as a reduction of revenue rather than as an operating expense unless we receive a benefit that we can identify and reasonably estimate we adopted this new release beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2002 the adoption of eitf issue no 019 did not have a material impact on our total net revenue and as a result we did not reclassify prior period financial statements 42 in july 2002 the fasb issued sfas 146 “accounting for costs associated with exit and disposal activities” this statement revises the accounting for exit and disposal activities under eitf issue no 943 “liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity” a formal commitment to a plan to exit an activity or dispose of longlived assets will no longer be sufficient to record a onetime charge for most exit and disposal costs instead companies will record exit or disposal costs when they are incurred and can be measured at fair value and will subsequently adjust the recorded liability for changes in estimated cash flows the provisions of sfas 146 are effective prospectively for exit or disposal activities initiated after december 31 2002 companies may not restate previously issued financial statements for the effect of the provisions of sfas 146 and liabilities that a company previously recorded under eitf issue no 943 are not affected we do not believe that the adoption of sfas 146 will have a material impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 43 risks that could affect future results 

 

 our revenue and earnings are highly seasonal seasonality and other factors cause significant quarterly and annual fluctuations in our revenue and net income several of our businesses are highly seasonal — particularly our tax businesses but also small business and personal finance to a lesser extent this causes significant quarterly fluctuations in our financial results revenue and operating results are usually strongest during the second and third fiscal quarters ending january 31 and april 30 we experience lower revenues and often significant operating losses in the first and fourth quarters ending october 31 and july 31 our financial results can also fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year due to a variety of factors including changes in product release dates and the timing of acquisitions dispositions goodwill and intangible assets impairment charges and gains and losses related to marketable securities fluctuations in interest rates can cause significant quarterly and annual fluctuations in our net income earnings per share and asset values recent declines in interest rates have resulted in a significant decline in the interest income we earned on our investment portfolio during recent reporting periods which has had a negative impact on our net income loss and net income loss per share declining interest rates can also reduce the value of our interest rate sensitive assets such as certain assets that relate to our payroll business see item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” for more details our recent acquisitions have presented business integration challenges and we may not fully realize the intended benefits of these acquisitions during the past few years we have completed numerous acquisitions including five during fiscal 2002 these acquisitions have expanded our product and service offerings personnel and geographic locations integrating and organizing acquired businesses creates challenges for our operational financial and management information systems as well as for our product development processes we might not be able to coordinate the diverse operating structures policies and practices of companies we have acquired or successfully integrate the employees of the acquired companies into our organization and culture which could harm employee morale and productivity these difficulties may be increased by the various geographic locations of our acquired businesses which include colorado connecticut ohio and texas if we do not adequately address issues presented by growth through acquisitions we may not fully realize the intended benefits including financial benefits of these acquisitions we expect to continue to make acquisitions which could put a strain on our resources and adversely affect our financial results a key component of our right for my business strategy is to continue to expand our product and service offerings and we expect that a significant portion of this expansion will result from acquisitions integrating newly acquired organizations and technologies into our business could put a strain on our resources and be expensive and time consuming in addition we may not succeed in integrating acquired businesses or technologies and may not achieve anticipated financial benefits our acquisition strategy and future acquisitions could also result in the following risks  44  acquisitionrelated costs can cause significant fluctuation in our net income our recent acquisitions have resulted in significant expenses including amortization of purchased software which is reflected in cost of revenue as well as charges for inprocess research and development and amortization and impairment of goodwill purchased intangibles and deferred compensation which are reflected in operating expenses total acquisitionrelated costs in the categories identified above were 1665 million in fiscal 2000 2634 million in fiscal 2001 including charges of 787 million to write down the longlived intangible assets related to three acquisitions and 1962 million in fiscal 2002 including charges of 273 million to write down the longlived intangible assets related to two acquisitions additional acquisitions and any additional impairment of the value of purchased assets could have a significant negative impact on our future operating results recent changes to financial accounting standards board guidelines relating to accounting for goodwill could make our acquisitionrelated charges less predictable in any given reporting period the new fasb standard for accounting for goodwill acquired in a business combination applies to all acquisitions initiated after june 30 2001 in the first quarter of fiscal 2003 we adopted the new standard for acquisitions we completed before june 30 2001 under the new standard we must continue to recognize goodwill as an asset but will not amortize goodwill as previously required instead we must separately test goodwill for impairment using a fairvaluebased approach at least annually and also when an event occurs indicating the potential for impairment as a result of this shift from an amortization approach to an impairment approach we will stop recording charges for goodwill amortization however it is possible that in the future we may incur less frequent but larger impairment charges related to the goodwill already recorded and to goodwill arising out of future acquisitions as we continue to expand our business as of august 1 2002 we had an unamortized goodwill balance of approximately 4308 million which included the amount of assembled workforce reclassified to goodwill these amounts could be subject to impairment charges in the future if we are required to account for options under our employee stock plans as a compensation expense it would significantly reduce our net income and earnings per share there has been increasing public debate about the proper accounting treatment for employee stock options although we are not currently required to record any compensation expense in connection with option grants that have an exercise price at or above fair market value it is possible that future laws or regulations will require us to treat all stock options as a compensation expense note 17 of the financial statements shows the impact that such a change in accounting treatment would have had on our net income and earnings per share if it had been in effect during the past three fiscal years and if the compensation expense were calculated as described in note 17 a general decline in economic conditions could lead to reduced demand for our products and services the continuing downturn in general economic conditions has led to reduced demand for a variety of goods and services including software and other technology products we believe the economic decline was partially responsible for slower than expected growth in our small business segment during fiscal 2001 and the first half of fiscal 2002 although we experienced solid revenue growth in most of our businesses during the second half of fiscal 2002 the future economic environment remains uncertain if conditions decline or fail to improve in geographic areas that are significant to us such as the united states canada and japan we could see a significant decrease in the overall demand for our products and services that could harm our operating results if we do not continue to successfully develop new products and services in a timely manner our future financial results will suffer we believe that it is necessary to continually develop new products and services and to improve existing products and services to remain competitive in the markets we serve 45 failure to do so may give competitors opportunities to improve their competitive position at our expense and result in declines in our revenue and earnings however developing and improving our products and services is a complex process involving several risks hiring and retaining highly qualified technical employees is critical to the success of our development efforts and we face intense competition for these employees launches of products and services can be delayed for a variety of reasons new or improved products and services may also have defects that hinder performance thirdparty products we incorporate in or use to build and support our products and services may also contain defects that impair performance these problems can be expensive to fix and can also result in higher technical support costs and lost customers new products or features are sometimes built on top of older architectures or infrastructures which can take longer to bring to market make quality assurance and support more difficult and lead to complexity in supporting future functionality 

the expansion of our product and service offerings through internal growth and through recent and anticipated acquisitions creates risks due to the number and complexity of our revenue models and the operational infrastructure required to support our expanded portfolio of products and services the business models for our expanding range of products and services rely on more complex and varied revenue streams than our traditional desktop software businesses in particular the revenue recognition practices of several of the businesses we have recently acquired are more complex than the revenue recognition principles that apply to our existing products and services we expect this trend to continue with future acquisitions as a result of both acquisitions and internal growth we expect to continue expanding our product offerings to larger enterprises and we may begin to offer additional features and options as part of multipleelement sales arrangements these dynamics may require us to defer a higher percentage of our product revenue at the time of sale than we do for current products which would decrease revenue at the time products are shipped but result in more revenue in fiscal periods after shipment in addition many of our newer businesses depend on a different operational infrastructure than our desktop software businesses and we must continually develop expand and modify our internal systems and procedures — including call center customer management order management billing and other systems — to support these businesses in particular the success of our internetbased services requires us to maintain continuous and reliable operations at our data center despite our efforts like all providers of internetbased products and services we occasionally experience unplanned outages or technical difficulties lengthy andor frequent service outages — particularly for services that customers consider timesensitive — can result in negative publicity damage to our reputation and lost customers despite our efforts to adequately staff and equip our customer service and technical support operations we cannot always respond promptly to customer requests for assistance we occasionally experience customer service and support problems including longer than expected “hold” times when our staffing is inadequate to handle higher than anticipated call volume and a large number of inquiries from customers checking on the status of product orders when the timing of shipments fails to meet customer expectations this can adversely affect customer relationships and our financial performance in order to improve our customer service and technical support we must continue to focus on eliminating underlying causes of service and support calls through product improvements and better order fulfillment processes and on more accurately anticipating demand for customer service and technical support we face risks relating to customer privacy and security and increasing regulation which could hinder the growth of our businesses despite our efforts to address customer concerns about privacy and security these issues still pose a significant risk and we have experienced lawsuits and negative publicity relating to privacy issues for example during fiscal 2000 and fiscal 2001 there were press articles criticizing our privacy and security practices as they relate to the connectivity of our desktop software to our web sites we have faced lawsuits and negative press alleging that we improperly shared information about customers with thirdparty “ad servers” for our web sites a major breach of customer privacy or security by intuit or even by another company could have serious consequences for our businesses including reduced customer interest andor additional regulation by federal or state agencies in addition the federal government has developed mandatory privacy and security standards and protocols and we have incurred significant expenses to comply with these requirements additional similar federal and state laws andor 46 laws that govern telemarketing activity may be passed in the future and the cost of complying with additional legislation could have a negative impact on our operating results if internet use does not grow as a result of privacy or security concerns increasing regulation or for other reasons the growth of our internetbased businesses would be hindered 

we face several risks relating to our retail distribution channel we face ongoing challenges in negotiating favorable terms including financial terms with retailers due in part to the recent trend of declining importance of software as a retail category in addition any termination or significant disruption of our relationship with any of our major resellers could result in a decline in our net revenue also any financial difficulties of our resellers could have an adverse effect on our operating expenses if uncollectible amounts from them exceed the bad debt reserves we have established we rely on thirdparty vendors to handle substantially all outsourced aspects of manufacturing and distribution for our primary retail desktop software products to manufacture and distribute our primary retail products at the time of product launches and to replenish products in the retail channel after the primary launch we have manufacturing relationships with modus media and sony and a distribution arrangement with ingram micro logistics while we believe that relying on only three outsourcers for product launches and replenishment improves the efficiency and reliability of these activities relying on any vendor for a significant aspect of our business can have severe negative consequences if the vendor fails to perform at acceptable service levels for any reason including but not limited to financial difficulties of the vendor actual product returns may exceed returns reserves particularly for our consumer tax preparation software we ship more desktop software products to our distributors and retailers than we expect them to sell in order to reduce the risk that distributors or retailers will run out of products this is particularly true for our consumer tax products which have a short selling season like most software companies we have a liberal product return policy and we have historically accepted significant product returns we establish reserves for product returns in our financial statements based on estimated future returns of products see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — critical accounting policies — net revenue — return and rebate reserves” we closely monitor levels of product sales and inventory in the retail channel in an effort to maintain reserves that are adequate to cover expected returns in the past returns have not generally exceeded these reserves however if we do experience actual returns that significantly exceed reserves it would result in lower net revenue we face existing and potential government regulation in many of our businesses which can increase our costs and hinder the growth of our businesses we offer some regulated products and services through separate subsidiary corporations establishing and maintaining regulated subsidiaries can requires significant financial legal and management resources if any regulated subsidiary fails to comply with applicable regulations it could face liability to customers andor penalties and sanctions by government regulators in addition our internetbased products and services are available in many states and foreign countries as a result we may be subject to regulation andor taxation in many additional jurisdictions which could substantially slow commercial use of the internet and growth of our internetbased businesses gains and losses related to marketable securities and other investments can cause significant fluctuations in our net income our investment activities have had a significant impact on our net income we recorded pretax net gains from marketable securities and other investments of 4811 million in fiscal 2000 and pretax net losses of 981 million in fiscal 2001 and 155 million in fiscal 2002 as of july 31 2002 our marketable securities balance was 168 million any additional significant longterm declines in value of these securities could reduce our net income in future periods legal protection for our intellectual property is not always effective to prevent unauthorized use or copying we rely on a combination of copyright patent trademark and trade secret laws and employee and thirdparty nondisclosure and license agreements to protect our software products and other proprietary technology current us laws that prohibit copying give us only limited practical protection from software “pirates” and the laws of many other countries provide very little protection policing unauthorized use of 47 our products is difficult expensive and timeconsuming although we have begun to incorporate product activation technology in some of our tax preparation products in order to reduce unauthorized sharing of the products we expect that software piracy will continue to be a persistent problem for our desktop software products in addition the internet may tend to increase and provide new methods for illegal copying of the technology used in our desktop and internetbased products and services we also face risks relating to our licensing of our intellectual property to third parties in connection with our sale of our quicken loans mortgage business we licensed the use of the quicken loans and quicken mortgage trademarks to the purchaser if the purchaser violates the terms of the trademark license it could result in serious and irreparable harm to intuit’s reputation and the value of its quickenrelated brands 

we do not own all of the software and other technologies used in our products and services we have the licenses from third parties that we believe are necessary for using technology that we do not own in our current products and services from time to time we may be required to renegotiate with these third parties to include their technology in our existing products in new versions of our current products or in new products we may not be able to renegotiate licenses on reasonable terms or at all we may unintentionally infringe on the intellectual property rights of others which could expose us to substantial damages or restrict our business operations as the number of our products and services increases and their features and content continue to expand we may increasingly become subject to infringement claims by third parties although we believe that we make reasonable efforts to ensure that our products and services do not violate the intellectual property rights of others it is possible that third parties still may claim infringement from time to time we have received communications from third parties in which the claimant alleges that a product or service we offer infringes the claimant’s intellectual property rights occasionally these communications result in lawsuits in many of these cases it is difficult to assess the extent to which the intellectual property that is being asserted is valid or the extent to which we have any material exposure past claims have not resulted in any significant litigation settlement or licensing expenses but future claims could present an exposure of uncertain magnitude existing or future infringement claims or lawsuits against us whether valid or not may be time consuming and expensive to defend intellectual property litigation or claims could force us to do one or more of the following cease selling incorporating or using products or services that incorporate the challenged intellectual property obtain a license from the holder of the infringed intellectual property which may not be available on commercially favorable terms or at all or redesign our software products or services possibly in a manner that reduces their commercial appeal any of these actions may cause material harm to our business and financial results our ability to conduct business could be impacted by a variety of factors such as electrical power interruptions earthquakes fires terrorist activities and other similar events our business operations depend on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of a large number of computer and communications hardware and software systems these systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from electrical power interruptions telecommunication failures earthquakes fires floods terrorist activities and their aftermath and other similar events other unpredictable events could also impact our ability to continue our business operations for our internetbased services system failures of our internal server operations or those of various thirdparty service providers could result in interruption in our services to our customers any significant interruptions in our ability to conduct our business operations could reduce our revenue and operating income our business interruption insurance may not adequately compensate us for the impact of interruptions to our business operations factors relating to competition we face competitive pressures in all of our businesses which can have a negative impact on our revenue profitability and market position there are formidable current and potential competitors including competition from publiclyfunded state government entities in the consumer tax area accordingly we expect competition to remain intense during fiscal 2003 and beyond in all our businesses we face continual risks that competitors will introduce better products and services reduce prices gain better access to distribution channels increase advertising including advertising targeted at intuit customers 48 and release new products and services before we do any of these competitive actions particularly any prolonged price competition could result in lower net revenue andor lower profitability for intuit they could also affect our ability to keep existing customers and acquire new customers 

in the small business and employer services areas we face a wide range of competitive risks that could impact our financial results our small business products and services face current competition from competitors’ desktop software as well as from other webbased small business services products microsoft offers several products and services targeted at similar size customers as our highend quickbooks products and has recently acquired additional products and services that compete with our small business offerings other competitors and potential competitors have begun providing or have expressed significant interest in providing accounting and business management products and services to small businesses as we implement our right for my business strategy we face increased competitive threats from larger companies in bigger markets than we have historically faced for example we face direct competition in our intuit payroll services — complete payroll business from traditional payroll services offered by a number of companies including paychex and adp our financial supplies business faces ongoing pricing pressures from many of our competitors we face intense competitive pressures in our consumer tax preparation software business which can have a negative impact on our revenue profitability and market position there are formidable current and potential competitors in the private sector we also face competition from publiclyfunded state government entities that offer individual taxpayers electronic tax preparation and filing services at no cost to individual taxpayers if state governmental agencies were to be successful in their efforts to develop consumer tax preparation and filing services and to gain consumer acceptance of those services it could have a significant negative impact on our financial results in future years the federal government announced a proposal in august 2002 that would mitigate the risk of government encroachment in federal tax preparation and filing services the policy proposes that for at least the next three years a number of private sector companies rather than the federal government would provide webbased federal tax preparation and filing services at no cost to lower income taxpayers and other underserved taxpayers through voluntary public service initiatives such as our intuit tax freedom project despite this positive development future administrative regulatory or legislative activity in this area could adversely impact intuit and other companies that provide tax preparation software and services intuit is actively working with others in the private sector as well as with state government policy makers to help clarify the appropriate roles for government agencies and the private sector in the electronic commerce marketplace our personal finance products face aggressive competition that could have a negative impact on revenue profitability and market position our quicken products compete directly with microsoft money which is aggressively promoted and priced we expect competitive pressures for quicken to continue both from microsoft money and from webbased personal finance tracking and management tools that are becoming increasingly available at no cost to consumers competitive pressures can result in reduced revenue and lower profitability for our quicken product line there are many competitors for our internetbased personal finance products and services however the general downturn in internet and technology stocks since march 2000 has resulted in significant consolidation with fewer but more financially sound competitors surviving this could make it more difficult for us to compete effectively specific factors affecting small business it is too early to provide any assurance that our right for my business strategy will generate substantial and sustained revenue growth in the small business accounting and business management segments a key component of our right for my business strategy is to continue to expand our small business accounting and management products and services through internal growth and from acquisitions we don’t expect that sales of our quickbooks desktop products alone will be adequate to meet our growth goals we must generate revenue from a wider range of market and customer segments as well as from 49 new products and services there are a number of risks associated with the strategy including the following 

 our financial supplies business relies on two key singlesource vendors we have an exclusive contract with john h harland company to print and fulfill supplies orders for all of our checks and most other products for our financial supplies business harland fulfilled orders for about 75 to 80 of our supplies revenue in fiscal 2000 and 2001 and about 85 of our supplies revenue in fiscal 2002 we believe that relying on one vendor improves customer service and maximizes operational efficiencies for our supplies business however if there are significant problems with harland’s performance it could have a material negative impact on sales of supplies and on intuit’s business as a whole we also have a solesource vendor that operates our supplies sales website if there are any significant problems with this vendor’s performance it could have a negative impact on supplies revenue specific factors affecting employer services our employer services business faces a number of risks that could have a negative impact on revenue and profitability for our employer services we must be able to process customer data accurately reliably and in a timely manner in order to attract and retain customers and avoid the costs associated with errors for example if we make errors in providing accurate and timely payroll information cash deposits or tax return filings we face potential liability to customers additional expense to correct product errors and loss of customers for our internetbased offerings including quickbooks doityourself payroll and quickbooks assisted payroll we must also continue to improve our operations to provide reliable connectivity to our data centers to enable customers to transmit and receive data in order to generate sustained growth for our intuit payroll services — complete payroll we will be required to successfully develop and manage a more extensive and proactive direct field sales operation which is a different distribution method than those we have historically relied on for future employer services we face the risk of potential delays in technology development as well as dependency on the performance of third parties that may be key to our ability to deliver certain services we also face the risk that we may not be able to successfully crosssell employee administration products and services to the existing base of quickbooks customers specific factors affecting our tax businesses we face intense competitive pressures in our consumer tax preparation software business which can have a negative impact on our revenue profitability and market position there are formidable current and potential competitors in the private sector we also face competition from publicly funded state government entities if state governmental agencies were to be successful in their efforts to develop 50 consumer tax preparation and filing services and to gain consumer acceptance of those services it could have a significant negative impact on our financial results in future years we expect competition to remain intense during fiscal 2003 and beyond 

if we fail to maintain reliable and responsive service levels for our electronic tax offerings we could lose revenue and customers our webbased tax preparation and electronic filing services must effectively handle extremely heavy customer demand during the peak tax season we face significant challenges in maintaining high service levels particularly during peak volume service times for example we experienced relatively brief unscheduled interruptions in our electronic filingand or tax preparation services during fiscal 2000 and 2001 and we reached maximum capacity for a short period on april 15 2002 we do not believe any prior service outages had a material financial impact prevented a significant number of customers from completing and filing their returns in a timely manner or posed a risk that customer data would be lost or corrupted however we did experience negative publicity in some instances the exact level of demand for quicken turbotax for the web and electronic filing is impossible to predict if we are unable to meet customer expectations in a costeffective manner we could lose customers receive negative publicity and incur increased operating costs any of which could have a significant negative impact on the financial and market success of these businesses significant problems or delays in the development of our tax products would result in lost revenue and customers the development of tax preparation software presents a unique challenge because of the demanding annual development cycle required to incorporate unpredictable tax law and tax form changes each year the rigid development timetable increases the risk of errors in the products and the risk of launch delays any major defects could lead to negative publicity customer dissatisfaction and incremental operating expenses — including expenses resulting from our commitment to reimburse penalties and interest paid by consumer customers due solely to calculation errors in our products a late product launch could cause our current and prospective customers to choose a competitor’s product for that year’s tax season or to choose not to purchase tax preparation software this would result in lost revenue in the current year and would make it more difficult for us to sell our products to those customers in future tax seasons specific factors affecting personal finance the longterm viability of personal finance business will depend on our ability to provide new products and services that attract customers and that can generate revenue sources other than just advertising revenue the demand for personal finance software such as quicken has been weakening over recent years and the demand for internet advertising on web sites like quickencom has declined precipitously we must identify and capitalize on additional sources of revenue to provide sustainable future growth for our personal finance business in an effort to stimulate customer demand and generate revenue growth we recently launched quicken brokerage powered by siebert an online and telephonebased securities brokerage service for quicken and quickencom customers made available through an exclusive strategic alliance with siebert financial corp the holding company for muriel siebert  co inc however it is too early to tell whether this service will generate sustainable revenue growth furthermore it is unlikely that the brokerage service even if successful will by itself be sufficient to sustain our personal finance business so we must identify additional sources for growth specific factors affecting our global business business conditions in international markets and other risks inherent in global operations may negatively impact our financial performance conducting business globally involves many risks including potential volatility in the political and economic conditions of certain foreign countries difficulties in managing operations in different locations including hiring and retaining management personnel a product development process that is often more timeconsuming and costly than in the united states due in part to localization requirements fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and unanticipated changes in foreign regulatory requirements in particular the economic situation in japan had a negative impact on global revenue and profits during recent fiscal years 51 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

shortterm investment portfolio we do not hold derivative financial instruments in our shortterm investment portfolio our shortterm investments consist of instruments that meet quality standards consistent with our investment policy this policy dictates that for shortterm investments we diversify our holdings and limit our shortterm investments with any individual issuer in a managed portfolio to a maximum of 5 million the following table of our shortterm investments portfolio is classified by the original maturity date listed on the security principal amounts by stated maturity  marketable securities we carried balances in marketable equity securities as of july 31 2002 that are subject to considerable market risk due to their volatility we considered all of our marketable securities held at that date to be availableforsale if our availableforsale securities experience further declines in fair value that are considered otherthantemporary we will reflect the additional loss in our net income loss in the period when the subsequent impairment becomes apparent see note 3 of the financial statements for more information regarding our investments in marketable securities and the impact our trading securities had on our reported net income loss in prior periods interest rate risk interest rate risk represents a component of market risk to us because significant declines in interest rates will cause unfavorable changes in our net income loss and net income loss per share and in the value of our interest rate sensitive assets liabilities and commitments particularly those that relate to our payroll business interest rate movements affect the interest income earned on investments we hold in our shortterm investment portfolio and the value of those investments over the past few years we have experienced significant reductions in our interest income due to declines in interest rates a significant decrease in future interest rates will have a material impact on the interest income earned on our cash equivalents and shortterm investments held at july 31 2002 impact of foreign currency rate changes we translate foreign currencies primarily canadian dollars japanese yen and british pounds into us dollars for financial reporting purposes accordingly currency fluctuations can have an impact on our financial results though the historical impact has generally been immaterial we believe that our exposure to currency exchange fluctuation risk is insignificant primarily because our global subsidiaries invoice customers and satisfy their financial obligations almost exclusively in their local currencies currency 52 exchange risk is also minimized since foreign debt is due exclusively in local foreign currencies for each of the three years presented there was an immaterial currency exchange impact from our intercompany transactions although the impact of currency fluctuations on our financial results has generally been immaterial in the past and we believe that for the reasons cited above currency fluctuations will not be significant in the future there can be no guarantee that the impact of currency fluctuations will not be material in the future as of july 31 2002 we did not engage in foreign currency hedging activities
