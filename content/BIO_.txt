general 

biorad laboratories inc referred to in this report as “biorad” “we” “us” and “our” is a multinational manufacturer and worldwide distributor of our own life science research and clinical diagnostics products biorad manufactures and supplies the life science research healthcare analytical chemistry and other markets with a broad range of products and systems used to separate complex chemical and biological materials and to identify analyze and purify their components 

we have direct distribution channels in over 35 countries outside the united states through subsidiaries whose focus is sales customer service and product distribution in some locations outside and inside these 35 countries sales efforts are supplemented by distributors and agents 

description of business 

business segments 

biorad operates in two industry segments designated as life science and clinical diagnostics both segments operate worldwide our life science segment and our clinical diagnostics segment generated 48 and 52 respectively of our net sales for the year ended december 31 2021 we generated approximately 39 of our consolidated net sales for the year ended december 31 2021 from the us and approximately 61 from our remaining worldwide markets 

life science segment 

our life science segment is at the forefront of discovery creating advanced tools to answer complex biological questions these tools are typically used to separate purify characterize or quantitate biological materials such as cells proteins and nucleic acids in the research laboratory or the biopharmaceutical manufacturing and quality control process for food safety and science education and literacy many of our products are used in established research techniques biopharmaceutical production processes and food testing regimes we are focused on the translational research market segment where our products help accelerate the timelines from discovery in the lab to the clinic and the patient we are a leader in the life sciences market and develop manufacture and market approximately 9000 reagents apparatus and laboratory instruments that serve a global customer base these techniques are typically used to separate purify and identify biological materials such as proteins nucleic acids and bacteria within a laboratory or production setting we focus on selected segments of the life sciences market in proteomics the study of proteins genomics the study of genes biopharmaceutical production cellular biology and food safety we estimate that the worldwide market that our portfolios can address for products in these selected segments of our addressable markets is approximately 19 billion our principal life science customers include universities and medical schools industrial research organizations government agencies pharmaceutical manufacturers biotechnology researchers food producers and food testing laboratories 

clinical diagnostics segment 

our clinical diagnostics segment designs manufactures sells and supports test systems informatics systems test kits and specialized quality controls that serve clinical laboratories in the global diagnostics market our products currently address specific niches within the in vitro diagnostics ivd test market and we seek to focus on the higher margin higher growth segments of this market 

we supply more than 3000 different products that cover more than 300 clinical diagnostic tests to the ivd test market we estimate that the worldwide sales for products in the markets we serve is approximately 16 billion ivd tests are conducted outside the human body and are used to identify and measure substances in a patient’s tissue blood or urine our products consist of reagents instruments and software typically provided to our customers as an integrated package to allow them to generate reproducible test results revenue in this business is highly recurring as laboratories typically standardize test methodologies which are dependent on a particular supplier’s equipment reagents and consumable products an installed base of diagnostic test systems therefore typically creates an ongoing source of revenue through the sale of test kits for each sample analyzed on an installed system our principal clinical diagnostic customers include hospital laboratories diagnostic reference laboratories transfusion laboratories and physician office laboratories 

raw materials and components 

we utilize a wide variety of chemicals biological materials electronic components machined metal parts optical parts computing and peripheral devices most of these materials and components are available from numerous sources and while we have historically not experienced difficulty in securing adequate supplies the impact of covid19 on our suppliers operations has created ongoing challenges in procuring materials for more discussion relating to the impacts of the covid19 pandemic and the difficulty of securing adequate supplies please see “item 1a risk factors” to this annual report in certain instances we acquire components and materials from a sole supplier due to the regulatory environment in which we operate we may be unable to quickly establish additional or replacement sources for some components or materials 

patents trademarks and licenses 

we own over 2200 us and international patents and numerous trademarks we also hold licenses under us and foreign patents owned by third parties and pay royalties on the sales of certain products under these licenses in addition we also receive royalties for licenses of our intellectual property we view these patents trademarks and license agreements as valuable assets however we believe that our ability to develop and manufacture our products depends primarily on our knowledge technology and special skills rather than our patent trademark and licensing positions 

seasonal operations 

our business is not inherently seasonal however the european custom of concentrating vacation during the summer months usually tempers third quarter sales volume and operating income 

sales and marketing 

we conduct our worldwide operations through an extensive direct sales force employing approximately 820 direct sales and sales management personnel around the world our sales force typically consists of experienced industry professionals with scientific training and we maintain a separate specialized sales force for each of our segments we believe that this direct sales approach allows us to sell a broader range of our products that creates more brand awareness and longterm relationships with our customers 

we also use a range of sales and marketing intermediaries smis in our international markets the types of smis we utilize are distributors agents brokers and resellers we have programs and policies in place with our smis to ensure their compliance with all applicable laws including adhering to our anticorruption standards to ensure a transparent sale to our customers 

our customer base is broad and diversified our worldwide customer base includes 1 prominent university and research institutions 2 hospital public health and commercial laboratories 3 other leading diagnostic manufacturers and 4 leading companies in the biotechnology pharmaceutical chemical and food industries 

our sales are affected by a number of external factors for example a number of our customers particularly in the life science segment are substantially dependent on government grants and research contracts for their funding 

most of our international sales are generated by our whollyowned international subsidiaries and their branch offices certain of these subsidiaries also have manufacturing operations biorad’s international operations are subject to certain risks common to foreign operations in general such as changes in governmental regulations import restrictions and foreign exchange fluctuations 

competition 

the markets served by our product groups are highly competitive our competitors range in size from startups to large multinational corporations with significant resources and reach we seek to compete primarily in market segments where the technology and efficacy of our products offer customers specific advantages over the competition 

our life science segment does not face the same competitors for all of its products due to the breadth of its product lines major competitors in this market include becton dickinson ge biosciences merck millipore and thermo fisher scientific we compete primarily based on meeting performance specifications and offering comprehensive solutions 

major competitors for our products in the clinical diagnostics segment include roche abbott laboratories siemens danaher thermo fisher scientific becton dickinson biomérieux ortho clinical diagnostics tosoh immucor and diasorin we compete across a variety of attributes including quality service and product portfolio 

research and development 

we conduct extensive research and development activities in all areas of our business research and development has played a major role in biorad’s growth and is expected to continue to do so in the future our research teams are continuously developing new products and new applications for existing products in our development of new products and applications we interact with scientific and medical professionals at pharma and biopharma companies universities hospitals and medical schools and within our industry in addition we regularly invest in companies that are engaged in the development of new technologies that either complement or expand our existing portfolio of products we have approximately 950 employees worldwide focused on research and development including degreed scientists engineers software developers and other technical support staff 

regulatory matters 

the development testing manufacturing marketing postmarket surveillance distribution advertising and labeling of certain of our products primarily diagnostic and donor screening products are subject to regulation in the united states by the center for devices and radiological health cdrh andor the center for biologics evaluation and research cber of the us food and drug administration fda and in other jurisdictions by state and foreign government authorities fda regulations require that some new products have premarketing notification “510k” or approval “pma” or biologics license application – “bla” by the fda and require certain products to be manufactured in accordance with fda’s “good manufacturing practice” regulations to be extensively tested and to be properly labeled to disclose test results and performance claims and limitations the fda’s 510k clearance process requires regulatory competence to execute and usually takes four to nine months but it can last longer the fda’s pma and bla processes require extensive regulatory competence to execute and may take one to two years 

a clinical trial is generally required to support a pma or bla application and is sometimes required for a 510k clearance or a de novo authorization conducting clinical trials is a complex and costly activity and frequently requires the use of outsourced resources that specialize in planning and conducting the clinical trial for the medical device manufacturer 

the european union “eu” has adopted the eu invitro diagnostics regulation the “eu ivdr” which imposes stricter requirements for the marketing and sale of invitro diagnostics products as compared to the predecessor invitro diagnostics directive ivdd including in the areas of clinical evaluation requirements quality systems economic operators and postmarket surveillance manufacturers of currently marketed invitro diagnostics products will have until may 2022 to meet the requirements of the eu ivdr though the eu council and parliament recently signed an amendment that delays certain previously mandated deadlines to allow more time for notified body to manage the entire portfolio of ivd products on the european market 

our manufacturing facilities as well as those of certain suppliers are subject to periodic routine and forcause inspections by the fda and other regulatory bodies to verify compliance with regulatory requirements similar inspections are performed by notified bodies to verify compliance to applicable iso standards eg iso 134852016 requirements under the medical device single audit program mdsap applicable to regulatory requirements of australia brazil canada japan and the us andor medical device regulations and requirements from the countries in which we distribute product and other specified audits by regulatory authorities if a regulatory body were to find that we or certain suppliers have failed to comply with applicable regulations eg recordkeeping reporting of adverse events it could institute a wide variety of enforcement actions ranging from issuance of a warning or untitled letter to more severe sanctions such as product recalls or seizures civil penalties consent decrees injunctions criminal prosecution operating restrictions partial suspension or shutdown of production refusal to permit importation or exportation refusal to grant or delays in granting clearances or approvals or withdrawal or suspension of existing clearances or approvals any of these actions could have an adverse effect on our business 

we are also subject to additional regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business such laws include without limitation state and federal antikickback fraud and abuse false claims privacy and security and physician sunshine laws and regulations if our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to us we may be subject to penalties including without limitation civil and criminal penalties damages fines the curtailment or restructuring of our operations exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment 

sales of our products will depend in part on the extent to which our products or diagnostic tests using our products will be covered by thirdparty payors such as government health care programs commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations these thirdparty payors are increasingly reducing reimbursements for certain medical products and services in addition the us government state legislatures and foreign governments have continued implementing cost containment programs including price controls and restrictions on reimbursement adoption of price controls and costcontainment measures and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures could further limit our net revenue and results decreases in thirdparty reimbursement for our products or diagnostic tests using our products or a decision by a thirdparty payor to not cover our products could reduce or eliminate utilization of our products and have a material adverse effect on our sales results of operations and financial condition in addition healthcare reform measures have been and will be adopted in the future any of which could limit the amounts that governments will pay for healthcare products and services which could result in reduced demand for our products or additional pricing pressures 

as a multinational manufacturer and distributor of sophisticated instrumentation we must meet a wide array of electromagnetic compatibility and safety compliance requirements to satisfy regulations in the united states the european union and other jurisdictions 

our operations are subject to federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations that govern activities such as transportation of goods emissions to air and discharges to water as well as handling and disposal practices for solid hazardous and medical wastes in addition to environmental laws that regulate our operations we are also subject to environmental laws and regulations that create liabilities and cleanup responsibility for spills disposals or other releases of hazardous substances into the environment as a result of our operations or otherwise impacting real property that we own or operate the environmental laws and regulations could also subject us to claims by third parties for damages resulting from any spills disposals or releases resulting from our operations or at any of our properties 

these regulatory requirements vary widely among countries 

human capital resources 

at biorad we consider our employees to be our most valuable asset and critical to the effective development manufacture sale distribution and servicing of our vast array of products and services our employees are essential to satisfying our customers’ needs for products to advance science and healthcare at december 31 2021 we had approximately 7900 employees the overwhelming majority of which are fulltime employees our employees are located throughout the world with roughly 46 in the americas 39 in europe the middleeast and africa and 15 in asia pacific our employees work in over 140 locations in 36 different countries around the world

 item 1a risk factors 

in evaluating our business and whether to invest in any of our securities you should carefully read the following risk factors in addition to the other information contained in this report we believe that any of the following risks could have a material effect on our business results of operations or financial condition our industry or the trading price of our common stock we operate in a continually changing business environment and new risks and uncertainties emerge from time to time we cannot predict these new risks and uncertainties nor can we assess the extent to which any such new risks and uncertainties or the extent to which the risks and uncertainties set forth below may adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition our industry the value of our equity holdings or the trading price of our common stock please carefully consider the following discussion of significant factors events and uncertainties that make an investment in our securities risky and provide important information for the understanding of the “forwardlooking” statements discussed this report in addition to the effects of the covid19 pandemic and resulting global disruptions on our business and operations discussed in this report additional or unforeseen effects from the covid19 pandemic and the global economic climate may give rise to or amplify many of these risks discussed below 

business economic legal and industry risks 

pandemics or disease outbreaks such as the covid19 pandemic have affected and could materially adversely affect our business operations financial condition and results of operations 

although we expect that vaccinations for covid19 will continue to improve conditions the covid19 pandemic has had and if conditions deteriorate again could continue to have an adverse effect on the united states and global economies as well as on aspects of our operations and those of third parties on whom we rely the covid19 pandemic has impacted and we expect to some extent will continue to impact parts of our business operations financial condition and results of operations in a variety of ways 

although we have experienced increased demand for certain of our products being used in fighting the covid19 pandemic we previously experienced some decreases in product demand in certain of our other businesses many of our customers reduced or modified operations to various extents resulting in labs universities and other customers facilities being opened at reduced capacity hospital visits declined as people delayed elective surgeries and avoided nonessential trips to the hospital and routine diagnostic testing slowed if conditions related to the pandemic were to deteriorate we expect that parts of our business could again suffer negative impacts from the pandemic we expect that an improvement in the covid19 pandemic conditions will result in a decrease in demand for our products being used in fighting the covid19 pandemic which could have a negative impact on our financial results if the negative impact is not offset by the recovery of other parts of our businesses as a result of improved conditions related to the pandemic 

on the supply side we are experiencing increased challenges with the supply of raw materials and components used in the production of our products with some suppliers operating at reduced or modified capacity and otherwise unable to meet our demand for raw materials and inputs to manufacture our products there are currently industry wide supply shortages of plastic materials raw material resins and certain electronic components as well shortages of raw materials have caused backorders some of which we consider to be significant and some delays in certain new product development activities and we expect backorders and delays to continue in 2022 in addition we continue to experience transportation challenges in moving goods across regions including reduced freight availability as some airlines have scaled back flight operations increased freight surcharges due to reduced freight capacity and ocean freight capacity has been constrained by delays at ports on the west coast of the us and globally some countries continue to impose travel restrictions and may continue to impose measures that restrict the movement of our goods we have experienced raw material cost increases as a result of the covid19 pandemic which may continue the invocation by the us federal government of the defense production act of 1950 with respect to our manufacturing operations or the enforcement of comparable laws by other governmental entities could disrupt our manufacturing and distribution operations 

with respect to our personnel as a critical health care supplier we have continued to keep essential production distribution and service teams onsite working in manufacturing and supply chain facilities throughout the world many employees in our administrative functions continue to work remotely and we anticipate they will continue to do so until pandemic conditions improve although we are adhering to government mandated and environmental health and safety protocols an outbreak of covid19 at one or more of our facilities could nonetheless cause shutdowns of facilities and a reduction in our workforce which could dramatically affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results 

the duration of the covid19 pandemic is unknown even with the distribution of a vaccine and boosters and it is difficult to predict the full extent of potential impacts the pandemic will have in the future on our business operations and financial results or on our customers suppliers logistics providers or on the global economy as a whole 

a reduction or interruption in the supply of components and raw materials could adversely affect our manufacturing operations and related product sales 

the manufacture of our products requires the timely delivery of sufficient amounts of quality components and materials we manufacture our products in numerous manufacturing facilities around the world we acquire our components and materials from many suppliers in various countries we work closely with our suppliers to ensure the continuity of supply but we cannot guarantee these efforts will always be successful further while we seek to diversify our sources of components and materials in certain instances we acquire components and materials from a sole supplier the covid19 pandemic has created delays and shortages in the supply of components and raw materials in addition due to the regulatory environment in which we operate we may be unable to quickly establish additional or replacement sources for some components or materials if our supply is reduced or interrupted or of poor quality and we are unable to develop alternative sources for such supply our ability to manufacture our products in a timely or costeffective manner could be adversely affected which would adversely affect our ability to sell our products see also our risk factor regarding the covid19 pandemic above 

our international operations expose us to additional costs and legal and regulatory risks which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we have significant international operations we have direct distribution channels in over 35 countries outside the united states and during the twelve months ended december 31 2021 our foreign entities generated 61 of our net sales compliance with complex foreign and us laws and regulations that apply to our international operations increases our cost of doing business these numerous and sometimes conflicting laws and regulations include among others data privacy requirements labor relations laws tax laws anticompetition regulations import and trade restrictions tariffs duties quotas and other trade barriers export requirements us laws such as the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa and other us federal laws and regulations established by the office of foreign asset control foreign laws such as the uk bribery act 2010 or other foreign laws which prohibit corrupt payments to governmental officials or certain payments or remunerations to customers in addition changes in laws or regulations potentially could be disruptive to our operations and business relationships in the affected regions for example the united kingdoms withdrawal from the european union commonly referred to as “brexit” has caused some disruption to the free movement of goods services and people between the united kingdom and the european union and has resulted in increased regulatory complexities 

given the high level of complexity of the foreign and us laws and regulations that apply to our international operations there is a risk that we may inadvertently breach some provisions for example through fraudulent or negligent behavior of individual employees our failure to comply with certain formal documentation requirements or otherwise our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate these risks and manage these challenges through policies procedures and internal controls however we have a dispersed international sales organization and we use distributors and agents in many of our international operations this structure makes it more difficult for us to ensure that our international selling operations comply with laws and regulations and our global policies and procedures 

violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines criminal sanctions against us our officers or our employees requirements to obtain export licenses cessation of business activities in sanctioned countries implementation of compliance programs and prohibitions on the conduct of our business violations of laws and regulations also could result in prohibitions on our ability to offer our products in one or more countries and could materially damage our reputation our brand our international expansion efforts our ability to attract and retain employees or our business results of operations and financial condition see also our risk factors regarding the covid19 pandemic above and regarding government regulations and global economic conditions below 

the industries and market segments in which we operate are highly competitive and we may not be able to compete effectively 

the life science and clinical diagnostics markets are each highly competitive some of our competitors have greater financial resources than we do making them better equipped to license technologies and intellectual property from third parties or to fund research and development manufacturing and marketing efforts moreover competitive and regulatory conditions in many markets in which we operate restrict our ability to fully recover through price increases higher costs of acquired goods and services resulting from inflation and other drivers of cost increases many public tenders have become more competitive due to governments lengthening the commitments of their public tenders to multiple years which reduce the number of tenders in which we can participate annually because the value of these multipleyear tenders is so high our competitors have been more aggressive with their pricing our failure to compete effectively andor pricing pressures resulting from competition could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

we may not be able to grow our business because of our failure to develop new or improved products 

our future growth depends in part on our ability to continue to improve our product offerings and develop and introduce new product lines and extensions that integrate technological advances in particular we may not be able to keep up with changes in the clinical diagnostics industry such as the trend toward molecular diagnostics or pointofcare tests if we are unable to integrate technological advances into our product offerings or to design develop manufacture and market new product lines and extensions successfully and in a timely manner our business results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected the covid19 pandemic has caused some delays to our ability to develop and introduce new products we have experienced product launch delays in the past and may do so in the future we cannot assure you that our product and process development efforts will be successful or that new products we introduce will achieve market acceptance failure to launch successful new products or improvements to existing products may cause our products to become obsolete which could harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

breaches of our information systems could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

we have experienced and expect to continue to experience attempts by computer programmers and hackers to attack and penetrate our layered security controls like the december 2019 cyberattack that was previously discussed in item 7 of our annual report for the period ended december 31 2019 through our sales and ecommerce channels we collect and store confidential information that customers provide to among other things purchase products or services enroll in promotional programs and register on our web site we also acquire and retain information about suppliers and employees in the normal course of business such information on our systems includes personally identifiable information and in limited instances protected health information we also create and maintain proprietary information that is critical to our business such as our product designs and manufacturing processes despite recent initiatives to improve our technology systems such as our enterprise resource planning implementation and the centralization of our global information technology organization we could experience a significant data security breach increased use of remote work arrangements and rapidly evolving work scenarios in response to the covid19 pandemic expose us to additional risk of cyberattack and disruption because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target we may not be able to anticipate all of these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures computer hackers have attempted to penetrate and will likely continue to attempt to penetrate our and our vendors’ information systems and if successful could misappropriate confidential customer supplier employee or other business information such as our intellectual property third parties could also gain control of our systems and use them for criminal purposes while appearing to be us as a result we could lose existing customers have difficulty attracting new customers be exposed to claims from customers financial institutions payment card associations employees and other persons have regulatory sanctions or penalties imposed incur additional expenses or lose revenues as a result of a data privacy breach or suffer other adverse consequences our operations and ability to process sales orders particularly through our ecommerce channels could also be disrupted as they were in the december 2019 cyberattack any significant breakdown intrusion interruption corruption or destruction of our systems as well as any data breaches could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations see also our risk factors regarding our information technology systems and our enterprise resource planning system erp implementation below 

if our information technology systems are disrupted or if we fail to successfully implement manage and integrate our information technology and reporting systems our business results of operations and financial condition could be harmed 

our information technology it systems are an integral part of our business and a serious disruption of our it systems which increasingly include cloudbased systems provided by third party vendors could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition we depend on our it systems to process orders manage inventory and collect accounts receivable our it systems also allow us to efficiently purchase products from our suppliers and ship products to our customers on a timely basis maintain costeffective operations and provide customer service we may experience disruption of our it systems due to redundancy issues with our network servers we cannot assure you that our contingency plans will allow us to operate at our current level of efficiency 

our ability to implement our business plan in a rapidly evolving market requires effective planning reporting and analytical processes we expect that we will need to continue to improve and further integrate our it systems reporting systems and operating procedures by training and educating our employees with respect to these improvements and integrations on an ongoing basis in order to effectively run our business we may suffer interruptions in service loss of data or reduced functionality when we upgrade or change systems or migrate to cloudbased systems if we fail to successfully manage and integrate our it systems reporting systems and operating procedures it could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition see also our risk factors regarding our data security above and erp implementation and events beyond our control below 

we are subject to foreign currency exchange fluctuations which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

as stated above a significant portion of our operations and sales are outside of the united states when we make purchases and sales in currencies other than the us dollars we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar that may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition our international sales are largely denominated in local currencies as a result the strengthening of the us dollar negatively impacts our consolidated net sales expressed in us dollars conversely when the us dollar weakens our expenses at our international sites increase in addition the volatility of other currencies may negatively impact our operations outside of the united states and increase our costs to hedge against currency fluctuations in addition we hold investments and a loan receivable that are subject to foreign exchange fluctuations we cannot assure you that future shifts in currency exchange rates will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

changes in the market value of our position in sartorius ag materially impact our financial results and the value of our investments might cause us to be deemed an investment company 

changes in the market value of our position in sartorius ag will continue to materially impact our consolidated statements of income and other financial statements a decline in the market value of our position in sartorius ag will result in losses due to writedowns in the value of the equity securities an increase in the market value of our position in sartorius ag will result in a favorable impact to net income independent of the actual operating performance of our business depending on the extent of the decline or of the increase in the market value of our position in sartorius ag these negative or positive impacts on us could be significant and material as a result of the market value of our position in sartorius ag we might be deemed to be an “investment company” under section 3a1c of the investment company act of 1940 as amended the “investment company act” even though we are primarily engaged in a business other than that of investing reinvesting owning holding or trading in securities the company does not believe it is an investment company and intends to continue to conduct our operations so that we will not be deemed an investment company if the company were deemed to be an investment company such determination could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our share price may change significantly based upon changes in the market valuation of sartorius ag and such change are unrelated to the actual performance of our business nonoperating income for a period may be significantly impacted by the timing of dividends paid by sartorius ag particularly in comparison to prior year periods 

we may incur losses in future periods due to writedowns in the value of financial instruments 

we have positions in a variety of financial instruments including asset backed securities and other similar instruments financial markets are volatile particularly in light of the covid19 pandemic and the markets for these securities can be illiquid the value of these securities will continue to be impacted by external market factors including default rates changes in the value of the underlying property such as residential or commercial real estate rating agency actions the prices at which observable market transactions occur and the financial strength of various entities such as financial guarantors who provide insurance for the securities should we need to convert these positions to cash we may not be able to sell these instruments without significant losses due to current debtor financial conditions low trading volume of the securities or other market considerations 

as discussed further in part 1 item 7 of this annual report under the heading “loan” we made a loan of 400 million euros to sartoriusherbst beteiligungen ii gmbh in november 2021 that is secured by the pledge of certain trust interests which upon termination of the trust represent the right to receive sartorius ordinary shares prior to a termination of the trust the trust interests which are provided as collateral for the loan are not tradable on the capital markets and may in case of an enforcement have to be sold with a significant discount to the value of the underlying shares 

we also have positions in equity securities including our position in sartorius ag financial markets are volatile and the markets for these equity securities can be illiquid as well a decline in the market value of our investments in equity securities that we own could result in significant losses due to writedowns in the value of the equity securities also if we need to convert these positions to cash we may not be able to sell these equity securities without significant losses in addition a significant decline in the value of the sartorius ordinary shares would reduce the value of the collateral for the loan discussed in the previous paragraph and in such circumstances the value of the collateral may be insufficient to cover the repayment of the loan and sartoriusherbst beteiligungen ii gmbh will likely have no other assets from which to repay the loan furthermore the change in the market value of sartorius ordinary shares will have an impact on the value appreciation rights acquired in connection with the loan discussed in the previous paragraph 

we may experience difficulties implementing our new global enterprise resource planning system 

we are engaged in a multiyear implementation of a new global enterprise resource planning system erp the erp is designed to efficiently maintain our books and records and provide information important to the operation of our business to our management team the erp will continue to require significant investment of human and financial resources in implementing the erp we may experience significant delays increased costs and other difficulties as we already have with some of our earlier deployments any significant disruption or deficiency in the design and implementation of the erp could adversely affect our ability to process orders ship product send invoices and track payments fulfill contractual obligations or otherwise operate our business we expect to implement the remaining smaller phases of the erp platform over the next few years in addition our efforts to centralize various business processes and functions within our organization in connection with our erp implementation may continue to disrupt our operations and negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition 

recent and planned changes to our organizational structure could negatively impact our business 

we made significant changes to our organizational structure over the past few years at the beginning of 2020 we restructured the clinical diagnostics segment based on functional groups rather than product line divisions we have continued to reorganize aspects of our european operations including the reorganization announced in february 2021 these changes may have unintended consequences such as distraction of our management and employees labor unrest business disruption disruption of supply attrition of our workforce inability to attract or retain key employees and reduced employee morale or productivity 

risks relating to intellectual property rights may negatively impact our business 

we rely on a combination of copyright trade secret patent and trademark laws and thirdparty nondisclosure agreements to protect our intellectual property rights and products however we cannot assure you that our intellectual property rights will not be challenged invalidated circumvented or rendered unenforceable or that meaningful protection or adequate remedies will be available to us for instance unauthorized third parties have attempted to copy our intellectual property reverse engineer or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary or have developed equivalent technologies independently and may do so in the future additionally third parties have asserted patent copyright and other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to us and may do so in the future if we are unable to license or otherwise access protected technology used in our products or if we lose our rights under any existing licenses we could be prohibited from manufacturing and marketing such products from time to time we also must enforce our patents or other intellectual property rights or defend ourselves against claimed infringement of the rights of others through litigation as a result we could incur substantial costs be forced to redesign our products or be required to pay damages or royalties to an infringed party any of the foregoing matters could adversely impact our business results of operations and financial condition 

global economic and geopolitical conditions could adversely affect our operations 

in recent years we have been faced with very challenging global economic conditions the covid19 pandemic as discussed above is currently causing disruptions to global economic conditions it is unknown how long such disruptions will continue and whether such disruptions will become more severe a deterioration in the global economic environment may result in a decrease in demand for our products increased competition downward pressure on the prices for our products and longer sales cycles a weakening of macroeconomic conditions may and currently is also adversely affecting our suppliers which could continue to result in interruptions in the supply of the components and raw materials necessary for our products additionally the united states and other countries such as china and india recently have imposed tariffs on certain goods while tariffs imposed by other countries on us goods have not yet had a significant impact on our business further escalation of tariffs or other trade barriers could adversely impact our profitability andor our competitiveness see also our risk factors regarding the covid19 pandemic and our international operations above and regarding government regulations below 

reductions in government funding and the capital spending programs of our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

our customers include universities clinical diagnostics laboratories government agencies hospitals and pharmaceutical biotechnology and chemical companies the capital spending programs of these institutions and companies have a significant effect on the demand for our products such programs are based on a wide variety of factors including the resources available to make such purchases the availability of funding from grants by governments or government agencies the spending priorities for various types of equipment and the policies regarding capital expenditures during industry downturns or recessionary periods if government funding to our customers were to decrease or if our customers were to decrease or reallocate their budgets in a manner adverse to us our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

changes in the healthcare industry could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

there have been and will continue to be significant changes in the healthcare industry in an effort to reduce costs these changes include 

• the trend towards managed care together with healthcare reform of the delivery system in the united states and efforts to reform in europe has resulted in increased pressure on healthcare providers and other participants in the healthcare industry to reduce selling prices consolidation among healthcare providers and consolidation among other participants in the healthcare industry has resulted in fewer more powerful groups whose purchasing power gives them cost containment leverage in particular there has been a consolidation of laboratories and a consolidation of blood transfusion centers these industry trends and competitive forces place constraints on the levels of overall pricing and thus could have a material adverse effect on our gross margins for products we sell in clinical diagnostic markets 

• third party payors such as medicare and medicaid in the united states have reduced their reimbursements for certain medical products and services our clinical diagnostics business is impacted by the level of reimbursement available for clinical tests from third party payors in the united states payment for many diagnostic tests furnished to medicare feeforservice beneficiaries is made based on the medicare clinical laboratory fee schedule clfs a fee schedule established and adjusted from time to time by the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms some commercial payors are guided by the clfs in establishing their reimbursement rates laboratories and clinicians may decide not to order or perform certain clinical diagnostic tests if third party payments are inadequate and we cannot predict whether third party payors will offer adequate reimbursement for tests utilizing our products to make them commercially attractive legislation such as the patient protection and affordable care act as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act ppaca and the middle class tax relief and job creation act of 2012 has reduced the payments for clinical laboratory services paid under the clfs in addition the protecting access to medicare act of 2014 pama has made significant changes to the way medicare will pay for clinical laboratory services which has further reduced reimbursement rates 

to the extent that the healthcare industry seeks to address the need to contain costs stemming from reform measures such as those contained in the ppaca and the pama or in future legislation by limiting the number of clinical tests being performed or the amount of reimbursement available for such tests our business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected if these changes in the healthcare markets in the united states and europe continue we could be forced to alter our approach in selling marketing distributing and servicing our products 

we are subject to substantial government regulation and any changes in regulation or violations of regulations by us could adversely affect our business prospects results of operations or financial condition 

some of our products primarily our clinical diagnostic products production processes and marketing are subject to us federal state and local and foreign regulation including by the fda in the united states and its foreign counterparts the fda regulates our clinical diagnostic products as medical devices and we are subject to significant regulatory clearances or approvals to market our clinical diagnostic products and other requirements including for example recordkeeping and reporting requirements such as the fda’s medical device reporting regulations and reporting of corrections and removals the fda has broad regulatory and enforcement powers if the fda determines that we have failed to comply with applicable regulatory requirements it can impose a variety of enforcement actions ranging from public warning letters fines injunctions consent decrees and civil penalties to suspension or delayed issuance of approvals seizure or recall of our products total or partial shutdown of production withdrawal of approvals or clearances already granted and criminal prosecution 

the fda can also require us to repair replace or refund the cost of devices that we manufactured or distributed in addition the fda may change its clearance and approval policies adopt additional regulations or revise existing regulations or take other actions which may prevent or delay approval or clearance of our products or impact our ability to modify our currently approved or cleared products on a timely basis changes in the fda’s review of certain clinical diagnostic products referred to as laboratory developed tests which are tests developed by a single laboratory for use only in that laboratory could affect some of our customers who use our life science instruments for laboratory developed tests in the past the fda has chosen to not enforce applicable regulations and has not reviewed such tests for approval however the fda has issued draft guidance that it may begin enforcing its medical device requirements including premarket submission requirements to such tests any delay in or failure to receive or maintain clearance or approval for our products could prevent us from generating revenue from these products and adversely affect our business operations and financial results additionally the fda and other regulatory authorities have broad enforcement powers regulatory enforcement or inquiries or other increased scrutiny on us could affect the perceived safety and efficacy of our products and dissuade our customers from using our products 

many foreign governments have similar rules and regulations regarding the importation registration labeling sale and use of our products such agencies may also impose new requirements that may require us to modify or reregister products already on the market or otherwise impact our ability to market our products in those countries for example the eu adopted the eu invitro diagnostics regulation the “eu ivdr” which includes broad changes regarding in vitro diagnostic devices and medical devices the implementation date for the eu ivdr is may 2022 though the eu council and parliament recently signed an amendment that delays certain previously mandated deadlines to allow more time for notified body to manage the entire portfolio of ivd products on the european market the eu ivdr will require us to modify or reregister some products and will result in additional costs failure to meet these requirements could adversely impact our business in the eu and other regions that tie their product registrations to the eu requirements in addition russia has enacted more stringent medical product registration and labeling regulations china has enacted stricter labeling requirements and we expect other countries such as brazil and india to impose more regulations that impact our product registrations brexit is resulting in additional regulatory requirements associated with goods manufactured and sold in the united kingdom and additional complexities and delays with respect to goods raw materials and personnel moving between the united kingdom and the european union in addition new government administrations may interpret existing regulations or practices differently due to these evolving and diverse requirements we face uncertain product approval timelines additional time and effort to comply as well as the potential for reduced sales andor fines for noncompliance increasing protectionism in such countries also impedes our ability to compete with local companies for example we may not be able to participate in certain public tenders in russia because of increasing measures to restrict access to such tenders for companies without local manufacturing capabilities certain tenders in china and india also are including local manufacturing preferences or requirements such regulations could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition see also our risk factors regarding our international operations and regarding global economic and geopolitical conditions above 

we are also subject to government regulation of the use and handling of a number of materials and controlled substances the us drug enforcement administration establishes registration security recordkeeping reporting storage distribution and other requirements for controlled substances pursuant to the controlled substances act of 1970 failure to comply with present or future laws and regulations could result in substantial liability to us suspension or cessation of our operations restrictions on our ability to expand at our present locations or require us to make significant capital expenditures or incur other significant expenses 

we cannot assure you that we will be able to integrate acquired companies products or technologies into our company successfully or we may not be able to realize the anticipated benefits from the acquisitions 

as part of our overall business strategy we pursue acquisitions of and investments in complementary companies products and technologies the benefits of any acquisition may prove to be less than anticipated and may not outweigh the costs reported in our financial statements completing any potential future acquisitions could cause significant diversion of our management’s time and resources if we acquire new companies products or technologies we may be required to assume contingent liabilities or record impairment charges for goodwill and other intangible assets over time goodwill and nonamortizable intangible assets are subject to impairment testing and potential periodic goodwill impairment charges amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets and other writeoffs could harm our operating results impairment tests are highly sensitive to changes in assumptions and minor changes to assumptions could result in impairment losses if the results forecast in our impairment tests are not achieved or business trends vary from the assumptions used in forecasts or external factors change detrimentally future impairment losses may occur as they have occurred in the past increased antitrust enforcement and greater government scrutiny of mergers in the healthcare sector may impact our ability to consummate acquisitions we cannot assure you that we will successfully overcome these risks or any other problems we encounter in connection with any acquisitions and any such acquisitions could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

product quality and liability issues could harm our reputation and negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition 

we must adequately address quality issues associated with our products including defects in our engineering design and manufacturing processes as well as defects in thirdparty components included in our products our instruments reagents and consumables are complex and identifying the root cause of quality issues especially those affecting reagents or thirdparty components is difficult we may incur significant costs and expend substantial time in researching and remediating such issues quality issues could also delay our launching or manufacturing of new products in addition quality issues unapproved uses of our products or inadequate disclosure of risks related to our products could result in product recalls or product liability or other claims being brought against us these issues could harm our reputation impair our relationship with existing customers and harm our ability to attract new customers which could negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition 

lack of key personnel could hurt our business 

our products are very technical in nature and we operate in a complex and competitive business environment in general only highly qualified and welltrained scientists have the necessary skills to develop market and sell our products and many of our manufacturing positions require very specialized knowledge and skills in addition the global nature of our business also requires that we have sophisticated and experienced staff to comply with increasingly complex international laws and regulations we face intense competition for these professionals from our competitors customers marketing partners and other companies throughout our industry in particular the job market in northern california where many of our employees are located is very competitive if we do not offer competitive compensation and benefits we may fail to retain or attract a sufficient number of qualified personnel which could impair our ability to properly run our business we have experienced increased turnover since the start of the covid19 pandemic as conditions improve from the pandemic and more employees return to the workplace from working remotely we anticipate further increases to turnover in addition our recently mandated covid19 vaccine policy in the unites states has resulted in a loss of personnel 

we may have higher than anticipated tax liabilities 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and many foreign jurisdictions we report our results of operations based on our determination of the amount of taxes owed in various tax jurisdictions in which we operate the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires estimation judgment and calculations where the ultimate tax determination may not be certain our determination of our tax liabilities is subject to review or examination by tax authorities in various tax jurisdictions tax authorities have disagreed with our judgment in the past and may disagree with positions we take in the future resulting in assessments of additional taxes any adverse outcome of such review or examination could have a negative impact on our operating results and financial condition 

economic and political pressures to increase tax revenues in various jurisdictions may make resolving tax disputes more difficult for example in recent years the tax authorities in europe have disagreed with our tax positions related to hybrid debt research and development credits transfer pricing and indirect taxes among others we regularly assess the likelihood of the outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals 

changes in tax laws or rates changes in the interpretation of tax laws or changes in the jurisdictional mix of our earnings could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations 

on december 22 2017 the us enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act the “tax act” which made a number of substantial changes to how the united states imposes income tax on multinational corporations the us treasury internal revenue service and other standard setting bodies continue to issue guidance and interpretation relating to the tax act as future guidance is issued we may make adjustments to amounts previously reported that could materially impact our financial statements 

on march 31 2021 the current us presidential administration proposed the “american jobs plan” to create domestic jobs rebuild national infrastructure and increase american competitiveness to fund its cost the administration also proposed the “made in america tax plan” furthermore in third quarter of 2021 the house of representatives proposed the “build back better act” and senators wyden brown and warner unveiled draft international tax overhaul legislation if any of the provisions are enacted our effective tax rate and cash tax liability will increase which could materially impact our financial statements 

the tax effect of our position in sartorius ag and the jurisdictional mix of our earnings could continue to materially affect our financial results and cash flow in addition the adoption of some or all of the recommendations set forth in the organization for economic cooperation and development’s project on “base erosion and profit shifting” beps by tax authorities in the countries in which we operate could negatively impact our effective tax rate these recommendations focus on payments from affiliates in high tax jurisdictions to affiliates in lower tax jurisdictions and the activities that give rise to a taxable presence in a particular country 

environmental health and safety regulations and enforcement proceedings may negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition 

our operations are subject to federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations that govern such activities as transportation of goods emissions to air and discharges to water as well as handling and disposal practices for solid hazardous and medical wastes in addition to environmental laws that regulate our operations we are also subject to environmental laws and regulations that create liability and cleanup responsibility for spills disposals or other releases of hazardous substances into the environment as a result of our operations or otherwise impacting real property that we own or operate the environmental laws and regulations also subject us to claims by third parties for damages resulting from any spills disposals or releases resulting from our operations or at any of our properties we must also comply with various health and safety regulations in the united states and abroad in connection with our operations 

we may in the future incur capital and operating costs to comply with currently existing laws and regulations and possible new statutory enactments and these expenditures may be significant we have incurred and may in the future incur fines related to environmental matters andor liability for costs or damages related to spills or other releases of hazardous substances into the environment at sites where we have operated or at offsite locations where we have sent hazardous substances for disposal we cannot assure you however that such matters or any future obligations to comply with environmental or health and safety laws and regulations will not adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

our current and future debt and related covenants may restrict our future operations 

we have a revolving credit facility that provides for up to 2000 million in borrowing capacity 02 million of which has been utilized for domestic standby letters of credit as of december 31 2021 our existing credit facility and agreements we may enter in the future contain or may contain covenants imposing restrictions on our business these restrictions may affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise existing covenants place restrictions on our ability to among other things incur additional debt acquire other businesses or assets through merger or purchase create liens make investments enter into transactions with affiliates sell assets in the case of some of our subsidiaries guarantee debt and declare or pay dividends redeem stock or make other distributions to stockholders our existing credit facility also requires that we comply with certain financial ratios including a maximum consolidated leverage ratio test and a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio test our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control including prevailing economic financial and industry conditions the breach of any of these restrictions could result in a default an event of default under our debt agreements would permit some of our lenders to declare all amounts borrowed from them to be due and payable together with accrued and unpaid interest 

we are subject to healthcare laws and regulations and could face substantial penalties if we are unable to fully comply with such laws 

we are subject to healthcare regulation and enforcement by both the us federal government and the us states and foreign governments in which we conduct our business these healthcare laws and regulations include for example 

• the us federal antikickback statute which prohibits among other things persons or entities from soliciting receiving offering or providing remuneration directly or indirectly in return for or to induce either the referral of an individual for or the purchase order or recommendation of any item or services for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as the medicare and medicaid programs 

• us federal false claims laws which prohibit among other things individuals or entities from knowingly presenting or causing to be presented claims for payment from medicare medicaid or other thirdparty payors that are false or fraudulent in addition the us federal government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal antikickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the false claims statutes 

• the us physician payment sunshine act which requires certain manufacturers of drugs biologics devices and medical supplies to record any transfers of value to us physicians and us teaching hospitals 

• the health insurance portability and accountability act hipaa as amended by the health information technology for economic and clinical health act which governs the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protects the security and privacy of protected health information and 

• state or foreign law equivalents of each of the us federal laws above such as antikickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any thirdparty payor including commercial insurers 

these laws will continue to impose administrative cost and compliance burdens on us the shifting compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust systems to comply with multiple jurisdictions with different compliance andor reporting requirements increases the possibility that a healthcare company may violate one or more of these requirements in addition any action against us for violation of these laws even if we successfully defend against it could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business if our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us we may be subject to penalties including civil and criminal penalties damages fines exclusion from the medicare and medicaid programs and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business results of operations and financial condition 

risks related to being a public company 

our failure to establish and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could result in material misstatements in our financial statements our failure to meet our reporting obligations and cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information which in turn could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline 

maintaining effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting are necessary for us to produce reliable financial statements material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting have adversely affected us in the past and could affect us in the future and the results of our periodic management evaluations and annual auditor attestation reports regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting required by section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 any failure to maintain or implement new or improved internal controls or any difficulties that we may encounter in their maintenance or implementation could result in additional material weaknesses result in material misstatements in our consolidated financial statements and cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations this could cause us to lose public confidence and could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline 

general business risks 

natural disasters terrorist attacks acts of war or other events beyond our control may cause damage or disruption to us and our employees facilities information systems security systems vendors and customers which could significantly impact our business results of operations and financial condition 

we have significant manufacturing and distribution facilities including in the western united states france switzerland germany and singapore in particular the western united states has experienced a number of earthquakes wildfires floods landslides and other natural disasters in recent years some of which may be associated with climate change these occurrences could damage or destroy our facilities which may result in interruptions to our business and losses that exceed our insurance coverage in addition electricity outages strikes or other labor unrest at any of our sites or surrounding areas could cause disruption to our business acts of terrorism bioterrorism violence or war or public health issues such as the outbreak of a contagious disease like covid19 could also affect the markets in which we operate our business operations and strategic plans political unrest may affect our sales in certain regions such as in southeast asia the middle east and eastern europe any of these events could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

risks related to our common stock 

a significant majority of our voting stock is held by the schwartz family which could lead to conflicts of interest 

we have two classes of voting stock class a common stock and class b common stock with a few exceptions holders of class a and class b common stock vote as a single class when voting as a single class each share of class a common stock is entitled to onetenth of a vote while each share of class b common stock has one vote in the election or removal of directors the classes vote separately and the holders of class a common stock are entitled to elect 25 of the board of directors with holders of class b common stock electing the remaining directors as a result of the schwartz familys ownership of our class a and class b common stock they are able to elect a majority of our directors effect fundamental changes in our direction and control matters affecting us including the determination of business opportunities that may be suitable for our company the schwartz family may exercise its control over us according to interests that are different from other investors’ or debtors’ interests in particular this concentration of ownership and voting power may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company 

the forum selection provision in our bylaws could increase costs to bring a claim discourage claims or limit the ability of the company’s stockholders to bring a claim in a judicial forum viewed by the stockholders as more favorable for disputes with the company or the company’s directors officers or other employees  

our bylaws provide that unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum the court of chancery of the state of delaware or if the court of chancery does not have jurisdiction another state court located within the state of delaware or if no state court located within the state of delaware has jurisdiction the federal district court for the district of delaware shall be the sole and exclusive forum for i any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the company ii any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director officer or other employee of the company to the company or the company’s stockholders iii any action arising pursuant to any provision of the general corporation law of the state of delaware the certificate of incorporation or the bylaws in each case as may be amended from time to time or iv any action asserting a claim against the company or any of its directors officers or other employees governed by the internal affairs doctrine of the state of delaware this choice of forum provision may increase costs to bring a claim discourage claims or limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with the company or the company’s directors officers or other employees which may discourage such lawsuits against the company or the company’s directors officers and other employees alternatively if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in the company’s bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action the company may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions 

application of the choice of forum provision may be limited in some instances by applicable law section 27 of the exchange act creates exclusive federal jurisdiction over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the exchange act or the rules and regulations thereunder as a result the choice of forum provision will not apply to actions arising under the exchange act or the rules and regulations thereunder section 22 of the securities act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the securities act or the rules and regulations thereunder subject to a limited exception for certain “covered class actions” there is uncertainty particularly in light of current litigation as to whether a court would enforce the choice of forum provision with respect to claims under the securities act our stockholders will not be deemed by operation of the company’s choice of forum provision to have waived claims arising under the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

this discussion should be read in conjunction with the information contained in our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes which are an integral part of the statements 

overview  we are a multinational manufacturer and worldwide distributor of our own life science research and clinical diagnostics products our business is organized into two reportable segments life science and clinical diagnostics with the mission to provide scientists with specialized tools needed for biological research and health care specialists with products needed for clinical diagnostics 

we sell more than 12000 products and services to a diverse customer base comprised of scientific research healthcare education and government organizations worldwide we do not disclose quantitative information about our different products and services as it is impractical to do so based primarily on the numerous products and services that we sell and the global markets that we serve 

we manufacture and supply our customers with a range of reagents apparatus and equipment to separate complex chemical and biological materials and to identify analyze and purify components as our customers require standardization for their experiments and test results much of our revenues are recurring in nature 

we are impacted by the support of many governments for both research and healthcare the current global economic outlook is still uncertain as the need to control government social spending by many governments limits opportunities for growth approximately 39 of our 2021 consolidated net sales are derived from the united states and approximately 61 are derived from international locations with europe being our largest international region the international sales are largely denominated in local currencies such as the euro swiss franc japanese yen chinese yuan and british sterling as a result our consolidated net sales expressed in dollars benefit when the us dollar weakens and suffer when the dollar strengthens when the us dollar strengthens we benefit from lower cost of sales from our international manufacturing sites and from lower international operating expenses we regularly discuss our changes in revenue and expense categories in terms of both changing foreign exchange rates and in terms of a currency neutral basis if notable to explain the impact currency fluctuation has on our results 

covid19 

the full impact of the covid19 pandemic continues to be inherently uncertain at the time of this report the covid19 pandemic has impacted and we expect to some extent will continue to impact parts of our business operations financial condition and results of operations in a variety of ways during 2021 we saw continued but moderating demand for products associated with covid19 testing and related research the covid19 pandemic has created delays and shortages in the supply of components and raw materials shortages of raw materials have caused backorders some of which we consider to be significant and some delays in certain new product development activities and we expect backorders and delays to continue in 2022 for more discussion relating to the impacts of the covid19 pandemic please see item 1a risk factors to this annual report 

acquisition 

on october 15 2021 the acquisition date we acquired all equity interests of dropworks inc dropworks for a total consideration of 1255 million 

dropworks is a development stage company focused on developing a digital pcr product the strategic rationale for the transaction was to address additional opportunities in the pcr market we believe this acquisition will complement our life science product offerings the acquisition was included in our life science segments results of operations from the acquisition date 

restructuring 

in february 2021 we announced our strategydriven restructuring plan in furtherance of our ongoing program to improve operating performance the restructuring plan primarily impacts our operations in europe and includes the elimination of certain positions the consolidation of certain functions and the relocation of certain manufacturing operations from europe to asia the restructuring plan is being implemented in phases and is expected to be substantially complete by the end of 2022 the amounts reflected in cost of goods sold selling general and administrative expense and research and development expense were 250 million 261 million and 133 million respectively in the consolidated statements of income for the year ended december 31 2021 as of december 31 2021 we have a restructuring accrual of 471 million the amounts are estimates based on the information currently available to management 

loan 

in november 2021 we extended a collateralized loan to sartoriusherbst beteiligungen ii gmbh shb a private limited company incorporated under the laws of germany with a principal amount of €400 million due at the latest on january 31 2029 subject to certain events which could trigger payment prior to maturity the “loan” the loan proceeds will be used by shb to partially finance the acquisition of interests under the sartorius family trust “trust” from a beneficiary of the trust the loan is collateralized by the pledge of certain of the trust interests which upon termination of the trust in mid2028 represent the right to receive sartorius ordinary shares interest on the loan is payable annually in arrears at 15 per annum and the entire principal amount is due at maturity in addition to contractual interest we are entitled to certain value appreciation rights associated with the acquired trust interests that are due upon repayment of the loan 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the accompanying discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities and contingencies as of the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis we base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources however future events may cause us to change our assumptions and estimates which may require adjustment actual results could differ from these estimates we have determined that for the periods reported in this annual report on form 10k the following accounting policies and estimates are critical in understanding our financial condition and results of operations 

accounting for income taxes 

we operate in multiple jurisdictions and our profits are taxed pursuant to the tax laws of these jurisdictions our effective income tax rate may be affected by the changes in or interpretations of tax laws and tax agreements in any given jurisdiction utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards changes in geographical mix of income and expense and changes in our assessment of matters such as the ability to realize deferred tax assets as a result of these considerations we must estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate this process involves estimating current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included in the consolidated balance sheet 

we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income considering all available evidence such as historical levels of income expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax strategies when we determine that it is not more likely than not that we will realize all or part of our deferred tax assets an adjustment is charged to earnings in the period when such determination is made likewise if we later determine that it is more likely than not that all or a part of our deferred tax assets would be realized the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed 

we make certain estimates and judgments about the application of tax laws the expected resolution of uncertain tax positions and other matters surrounding the recognition and measurement of uncertain tax benefits in the event that uncertain tax positions are resolved for amounts different than our estimates or the related statutes of limitations expire without the assessment of additional income taxes we will be required to adjust the amounts of the related assets and liabilities in the period in which such events occur such adjustments may have a material impact on our income tax provision and our results of operations 

business acquisitions 

accounting for business acquisitions requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions especially at the acquisition date with respect to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed and preacquisition contingencies in a business combination we allocate the purchase price to the acquired business’ identifiable assets and liabilities at their acquisition date fair values the excess of the purchase price over the amount allocated to the identifiable assets and liabilities if any is recorded as goodwill 

the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in our business combinations consist of acquired working capital and finitelived and indefinitelived intangible assets the carrying value of acquired working capital approximates its fair value given the shortterm nature of these assets and liabilities we estimate the fair value of finitelived and indefinitelived intangible assets acquired using a discounted cash flow approach which includes an analysis of the future cash flows expected to be generated by such assets and the risk associated with achieving such cash flows the key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow model include the discount rate that is applied to the discretely forecasted future cash flows to calculate the present value of those cash flows and the estimate of future cash flows attributable to the acquired intangible assets which include revenue operating expenses and taxes our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement as a result during the measurement period which may be up to one year from the acquisition date we may record adjustments to the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill 

goodwill and intangible assets 

goodwill represents the excess of a the aggregate of the fair value of consideration transferred in a business combination over b the fair value of assets acquired net of liabilities assumed goodwill is not amortized but is subject to annual impairment tests as described in the section impairment of goodwill 

we acquired intangible assets in connection with certain of our business acquisitions these assets were recorded at their estimated fair values at the acquisition date and are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives using a method of amortization that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets are used estimated useful lives are determined based on our historical use of similar assets and the expectation of future realization of cash flows attributable to the intangible assets changes in circumstances such as technological advances or changes to our business model could result in the actual useful lives differing from our current estimates in those cases where we determine that the useful life of an intangible asset should be shortened we amortize the net book value in excess of the estimated salvage value over its revised remaining useful life we did not revise our previously assigned useful life estimates attributed to any of our intangible assets during the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 

impairment of goodwill 

we conduct a goodwill impairment analysis annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist or if a decision is made to sell or exit a business we test goodwill at the reporting unit level significant judgments are involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred such indicators may include deterioration in general economic conditions negative developments in equity and credit markets adverse changes in the markets in which an entity operates increases in input costs that have a negative effect on earnings and cash flows a trend of negative or declining cash flows a decline in actual or planned revenue or earnings compared with actual and projected results of relevant prior periods or other relevant entityspecific events such as changes in management key personnel strategy or customers contemplation of bankruptcy or litigation the fair value that could be realized in an actual transaction may differ from that used to evaluate the impairment of goodwill 

we first may assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test included in us gaap to the extent our assessment identifies adverse conditions or if we elect to bypass the qualitative assessment goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level using a quantitative impairment test there were no impairments for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 

impairment of longlived assets 

we review longlived assets such as property and equipment and finitelived intangible assets for impairment whenever events indicate that the carrying amounts might not be recoverable typical indicators that an asset may be impaired include but are not limited to 

• a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a longlived asset is being used or in its physical condition 

• a currentperiod operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a longlived asset or 

• a current expectation that more likely than not a longlived asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life 

recoverability of property plant and equipment and other finitelived intangible asset is measured by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with those assets to their carrying values if an asset is considered impaired it is written down to its fair value which is determined based on the assets projected discounted cash flows or appraised value depending on the nature of the asset for purposes of recognition of impairment for assets held for use we group assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identifiable there were no triggering events to cause us to record an impairment charge for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue from operations through the sale of products services license of intellectual property and rental of instruments revenue from contracts with customers is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services we enter into contracts that can include various combinations of products and services which are generally accounted for as distinct performance obligations revenue is recognized net of any taxes collected from customers sales tax value added tax etc which are subsequently remitted to government authorities 

our contracts from customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment  and may or may not impact the timing of revenue recognition revenue associated with equipment that requires factory installation is not recognized until installation is complete and customer acceptance if required has occurred certain equipment requires installation due to the fact that the instruments are being operated in a clinicallaboratory environment and the installation services could result in modification of the equipment in order to ensure that the instruments are working according to customer specifications which are subject to validation tests upon completion of the installation in these arrangements which require factory installation the delivery of the equipment and the installation are separate performance obligations we will recognize the transaction price allocated to the equipment only upon customer acceptance as the transfer of control in relation to the equipment has occurred at that point as the customer has the ability to direct the use of and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from the asset the transaction price allocated to the installation services is also recognized upon customer acceptance because without the completion of the installation services and related customer acceptance the customer cannot receive any of the benefits of the service 

at the time revenue is recognized a provision is recorded for estimated product returns as this right is considered variable consideration accordingly when product revenues are recognized the transaction price is reduced by the estimated amount of product returns 

service revenues on extended warranty contracts are recognized ratably over the life of the service agreement as a standready performance obligation for arrangements that include a combination of products and services the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation based on standalone selling prices the method used to determine the standalone selling prices for product and service revenues is based on the observable prices when the product or services have been sold separately 

we recognize revenues for a functional license of intellectual property at a point in time when the control of the license and technology transfers to the customer for license agreements that include sales or usagebased royalty payments to us we recognize revenue at the later of i when the related sale of the product occurs or ii when the performance obligation to which some or all of the royalty has been allocated has been satisfied or partially satisfied 

the primary purpose of our invoicing terms is to provide customers with simple and predictable methods of purchasing our products and services not to either provide or receive financing to or from our customers we record contract liabilities when cash payments are received or due in advance of our performance 

we do not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for contracts with an original expected length of one year or less our payment terms vary by the type and location of our customer and the products and services offered the term between invoicing and when payment is due is not significant 

reagent rental agreements are primarily a diagnostic industry sales method that provides use of an instrument and consumables reagents to a customer on a per test basis these agreements may also include maintenance of the instruments placed at customer locations as well as initial training we initially determine if a reagent rental arrangement contains a lease at contract commencement where we have determined that such an arrangement contains a lease we next must ascertain its lease classification for purposes of applying appropriate accounting treatment as an operating salestype or direct financing lease for purposes of determining the lease term used in performing the lease classification test we include the noncancellable period of the lease together with those periods covered by the option to extend the lease if the customer is reasonably certain to exercise that option the periods covered by an option to terminate the lease if the customer is reasonably certain not to exercise that option and the periods covered by the option to extend or not to terminate the lease in which exercise of the option is controlled by the company the assessment of the lease term for reagent rental agreements including the impact from any associated contractual termination penalties are subject to an estimation process while most of our reagent rental arrangements contain either the option for a lessee to extend andor cancel the period in which the contract is enforceable is a very short period and therefore the lease term has been limited to the noncancellable period generally these arrangements do not contain an option for the lessee to purchase the underlying asset 

valuation of inventories 

we value inventory at the lower of the actual cost to purchase andor manufacture the inventory or the current estimated net realizable value of the inventory we review inventory quantities on hand and reduce the cost basis of excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on an estimated forecast of product demand production requirements and the quality and efficacy of raw materials this review is done at the end of each fiscal quarter in addition our industry is characterized by technological change frequent new product development and product obsolescence that could result in an increase in the amount of obsolete inventory quantities on hand our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate and if too high we may have overstated the carrying value of our inventory in the future if inventory is determined to be overvalued we would be required to write down the value of inventory to market and recognize such costs in our cost of goods sold at the time of such determination therefore although we make efforts to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand and perform procedures to safeguard overall inventory quality any significant unanticipated changes in demand technological developments regulations storage conditions or other economic or environmental factors affecting biological materials could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and reported results of operations 

fair value measurements 

us gaap establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value each level of input has different levels of subjectivity and difficulty involved in determining fair value valuation of level 1 and 2 instruments generally do not require significant management judgment and the estimation is not difficult level 3 instruments include unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities the determination of fair value for level 3 instruments requires the most management judgment and subjectivity 

we elected the fair value option under asc 825 financial instruments for accounting of the loan to sartoriusherbst beteiligungen ii gmbh the loan includes certain value appreciation rights that are due upon repayment of the loan the fair value of the loan and value appreciation right is estimated under the income approach using a discounted cash flow and option pricing model respectively which results in a fair value measurement categorized in level 3 the significant assumptions used to estimate fair value of the loan include an estimate of the discount rate and cash flows of the loan and the significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the value appreciation right include volatility the riskfree interest rate expected life in years and expected dividend the inputs are subject to estimation uncertainty and actual amounts realized may materially differ an increase in the expected volatility may result in a significantly higher fair value whereas a decrease in expected life may result in a significantly lower fair value all subsequent changes in fair value of the loan and value appreciation right including accrued interest are recognized in change in fair value of equity and debt securities in our consolidated statements of income 

results of operations  sales gross margins and expenses  incorporating by reference the results of operations  sales gross margins and expenses from our annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ended december 31 2020 

the following shows cost of goods sold gross profit expense items and net income as a percentage of net sales 



net sales 

percentage sales growth in currency neutral amounts are calculated by translating prior period sales in each local currency using the current period monthly average foreign exchange rates for that currency and comparing that to current period sales 

n et sales sales for the year ended december 31 2021 were 292 billion compared to 255 billion for the year ended december 31 2020 an increase of 148 excluding the impact of foreign currency for the year ended december 31 2021 sales increased by approximately 127 compared to the year ended december 31 2020 currency neutral sales increased in all regions led by growth in asia pacific and europe excluding the impact of covid related sales currency neutral sales increased by 17 compared to the year ended december 31 2020 

the life science segment sales for the year ended december 31 2021 were 140 billion an increase of 137 compared to the year ended december 31 2020 on a currency neutral basis sales increased 120 compared to the year ended december 31 2020 currency neutral sales were up in nearly all product lines but were primarily driven by growth in our western blotting digital pcr and process media products a significant portion of the life science segment growth came from products used to support covid19 research and testing all regions experienced double digit currency neutral sales growth compared to the year ended december 31 2020 

the clinical diagnostics segment sales for the year ended december 31 2021 were 152 billion an increase of 161 compared to the year ended december 31 2020 on a currency neutral basis sales increased 136 compared to the year ended december 31 2020 currency neutral sales increased across all product lines and regions as the overall diagnostics market continues to recover from the covid19 pandemic including an increase in utilization in lab operations 

gross margin 

consolidated gross margins were 561 for the year ended december 31 2021 compared to 565 for the year ended december 31 2020 life science segment gross margins for the year ended december 31 2021 increased by approximately 06 percentage points compared to the year ended december 31 2020 primarily related to increased sales volume favorable product mix related to higher sales of digital pcr and process media products and lower production costs clinical diagnostics segment gross margins for the year ended december 31 2021 decreased by approximately 11 percentage points compared to the year ended december 31 2020 the decrease in the clinical diagnostics segment gross margins for the year ended december 31 2021 was primarily related to the costs associated with the restructuring plan announced in february 2021 partially offset by increased sales for the year ended december 31 2021 

selling general and administrative expense 

consolidated selling general and administrative expenses sga increased to 8796 million or 301 of sales for the year ended december 31 2021 compared to 8003 million or 314 of sales for the year ended december 31 2020 the increase to sga was primarily related to the restructuring plan announced in february 2021 as well as increased employee related expenses 

research and development expense 

research and development rd expense increased to 2717 million or 93 of sales for the year ended december 31 2021 compared to 2266 million or 89 of sales for the year ended december 31 2020 rd expense increased for the year ended december 31 2021 compared to the year ended december 31 2020 in both the life science and clinical diagnostics segment the increase was primarily from increases in investment in strategic projects and research initiatives costs related to the restructuring plan announced in february 2021 and higher employee related expenses 

results of operations – nonoperating 

interest expense 

interest expense for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 was 16 million and 219 million respectively a decrease of 203 million primarily due to the repayment of the 4250 million principal amount of senior notes in december 2020 

foreign currency exchange gains and losses 

foreign currency exchange gains and losses consist primarily of foreign currency transaction gains and losses on intercompany net receivables and payables and the change in fair value of our forward foreign exchange contracts used to manage our foreign currency exchange risk foreign currency exchange net losses for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 were 28 million and 18 million respectively gains and losses are primarily due to the estimating process inherent in the timing of product shipments and intercompany debt payments market volatility and the change in the fair value of our foreign exchange contracts 

change in fair market value of equity and debt securities 

change in fair market value of equity and debt securities were gains of 493 billion for the year ended december 31 2021 compared to 450 billion for the year ended december 31 2020 primarily resulting from the recognition of holding gains on our position in sartorius ag of 492 billion in 2021 and 448 billion in 2020 partially offset by a decrease in fair value of a loan to sartoriusherbst beteiligungen ii gmbh of 108 million 

other income net 

other income net includes investment and dividend income interest income on our cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and longterm marketable securities other income net for the year ended december 31 2021 increased to 268 million compared to 245 million for the year ended december 31 2020 other income net increased primarily due to a 101 million increase in the sartorius ag dividends declared in 2021 and an increase in investment and other income of 39 million partially offset by a gain of 117 million on the sale of our informatics division in 2020 

effective tax rate 

our effective tax rates were 219 and 224 for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively the effective tax rates for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 were driven by the unrealized gain in equity securities that is taxed at approximately 22 as well as the geographic mix of earnings and the taxation of our foreign earnings our effective tax rate may be impacted in the future either favorably or unfavorably by many factors including but not limited to changes in the geographic mix of earnings changes to statutory tax rates changes in tax laws or regulations tax audits and settlements and generation of tax credits 

our income tax returns are routinely audited by us federal state and foreign tax authorities we are currently under examination by many of these tax authorities there are differing interpretations of tax laws and regulations and as a result significant disputes may arise with these tax authorities involving issues of the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions we do not believe any currently pending uncertain tax positions will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements although an adverse resolution of one or more of these uncertain tax positions in any period may have a material impact on the results of operations for that period 

we record liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions we do not believe the resolution of our uncertain tax positions will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements although an adverse resolution of one or more of these uncertain tax positions in any period may have a material impact on the results of operations for that period 

as of december 31 2021 based on the expected outcome of certain examinations or as a result of the expiration of statutes of limitation for certain jurisdictions we believe that within the next twelve months it is reasonably possible that our previously unrecognized tax benefits could decrease by approximately 208 million substantially all such amounts will impact our effective income tax rate 

comparison of the year ended december 31 2020 to the year ended december 31 2019 

refer to item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations located in our annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ended december 31 2020 filed on february 16 2021 for the discussion of the comparison of the fiscal year ended december 31 2020 to the fiscal year ended december 31 2019 the earliest of the three fiscal years presented in the consolidated statements of operations 

liquidity and capital resources 

biorad operates and conducts business globally primarily through subsidiary companies established in the markets in which we trade goods are manufactured in a small number of locations and are then shipped to local distribution facilities around the world our product mix is diversified and certain products compete largely on product efficacy while others compete on price gross margins are generally sufficient to exceed normal operating costs and funding for research and development of new products as well as routine outflows for capital expenditures interest and taxes in addition to the annual positive cash flow from operating activities additional liquidity is readily available via the sale of shortterm investments and access to our 2000 million unsecured revolving credit facility credit agreement that we entered into in april 2019 and amended in november 2021 see note 5 notes payable and longterm debt to the consolidated financial statements and to a lesser extent international lines of credit borrowings under the credit agreement are available on a revolving basis and can be used to make permitted acquisitions for working capital and for other general corporate purposes we had no outstanding borrowings under the 2019 credit agreement as of december 31 2021 however 02 million was utilized for domestic standby letters of credit that reduced our borrowing availability management believes that this availability together with cash flow from operations will be adequate to meet our current objectives for operations research and development capital additions for manufacturing and distribution plant and equipment information technology systems and acquisitions of reasonable proportion to our existing total available capital 

at december 31 2021 we had available 8699 million in cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments of which approximately 23 was held in our foreign subsidiaries the amount of funds held in the united states can fluctuate due to the timing of receipts and payments in the ordinary course of business and due to other reasons such as acquisitions as part of our ongoing liquidity assessments we regularly monitor the mix of domestic and foreign cash flows both inflows and outflows 

it is generally our intention to repatriate certain foreign earnings to the extent that such repatriations are not restricted by local laws or accounting rules and there are no substantial incremental costs 

demand for our products and services could change more dramatically in the shortterm than in previous years due to the impacts of the covid19 pandemic as well as due to funding reimbursement constraints and support levels from government universities hospitals and private industry including diagnostic laboratories the need for certain sovereign nations with large annual deficits to curtail spending international trade disputes and increased regulation could lead to slower growth of or even a decline in our business sovereign nations either delaying payment for goods and services or renegotiating their debts could impact our liquidity 

cash flows from operations 

net cash provided by operations was 6565 million and 5753 million for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively the net increase between the year ended december 31 2021 and the year ended december 31 2020 of 812 million was primarily due to higher cash received from customers as a result of the growth in sales higher sartorius ag dividends in 2021 compared to 2020 lower interest paid as a result of the repayment of the 4250 million principal amount of senior notes in december 2020 proceeds from forward foreign exchange contracts in 2021 compared to payments for forward foreign exchange contracts in 2020 and higher investment income received in 2021 than in 2020 these increases were partially offset by higher cash paid to suppliers primarily for materials to support the increase in sales cash paid for employee related expenses such as salaries bonuses and benefits and to a lesser extent for employee restructuring programs the increases were also partially offset by higher income taxes paid 

cash flows from operations during the first quarter have historically had larger payments for royalties fourth quarter sales commissions and annual employee bonuses and we expect this pattern to recur in the first quarter of 2022 

cash flows from investing activities 

our investing activities consisted primarily of cash used for extending a collateralized loan activity related to the purchases sales and maturities of marketable securities acquisitions and capital expenditures 

net cash used in investing activities was 7844 million and 603 million for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively the increase of 7242 million was primarily attributable to a 4534 million funding for a collateralized loan to sartoriusherbst beteiligungen ii gmbh an increase of 2043 million for net cash outflows from purchases sales and maturities of marketable securities and investments higher net cash outflows of 289 million for the acquisition of dropworks inc in 2021 compared to the acquisition of celsee inc in 2020 net payments of 219 million for higher capital expenditures and proceeds of 122 million from a divestiture of a division that was received in 2020 compared to none in 2021 

cash flows from financing activities 

  

our financing activities have consisted primarily of cash used for repayment of debt purchases of treasury stock payments for contingent consideration and cash proceeds from the issuance of common stock for sharebased compensation 

net cash used in financing activities was 554 million compared to 5230 million for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively this decrease was primarily attributable to the repayment of the 425 million principal amount of senior notes in 2020 and lower purchases of treasury stock in 2021 compared to 2020 of 500 million 

treasury shares 

during the year ended december 31 2021 114711 shares of class a treasury stock with an aggregate total cost of 436 million were reissued to fulfill grants to employees under our restricted stock program upon reissuing the class a treasury stock a loss of 67 million was incurred as they were reissued at a lower price than their average cost which reduced retained earnings while 370 million reduced additional paidin capital 

during the year ended december 31 2020 117423 shares of class a treasury stock with an aggregate total cost of 385 million were reissued to fulfill grants to employees under our restricted stock program upon reissuing the class a treasury stock a loss of 90 million was incurred as they were reissued at a lower price than their average cost which reduced retained earnings while 295 million reduced additional paidin capital 

the reissuance of the treasury stock for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 did not require cash payments or receipts and therefore did not affect liquidity 

in november 2017 the board of directors authorized a new share repurchase program granting biorad authority to repurchase on a discretionary basis up to 2500 million of outstanding shares of our common stock “share repurchase program” in july 2020 the board of directors authorized increasing the share repurchase program to allow the company to repurchase up to an additional 2000 million of stock as of december 31 2021 2231 million remained under the share repurchase program 

during the year ended december 31 2021 we repurchased 89506 shares of class a common stock for 500 million under our share repurchase program compared to the repurchase of 291941 shares of our common stock for 1000 million during the year ended december 31 2020 we designated these repurchased shares as treasury stock 

contractual obligations 

the following summarizes certain of our contractual obligations as of december 31 2021 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our cash flows in future periods in millions

see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for recent accounting pronouncements adopted and to be adopted 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

financial risk management 

the main goal of biorad’s financial risk management program is to reduce the variance in expected cash flows arising from unexpected foreign exchange rate and interest rate changes financial exposures are managed through operational means and by using various financial instruments including cash and liquid resources borrowings and forward and spot foreign exchange contracts no derivative financial instruments are entered into for the purpose of trading or speculation company policy requires that all derivative positions are undertaken to manage the risks arising from underlying business activities these derivative transactions do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment derivative instruments used in these transactions are valued at fair value and changes in fair value are included in reported earnings 

foreign exchange risk we operate and conduct business in many countries and are exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates we face transactional currency exposures that arise when we enter into transactions denominated in currencies other than us dollars additionally our consolidated net equity is impacted by the conversion of the net assets of our international subsidiaries for which the functional currency is not the us dollar 

foreign currency exposures are managed on a centralized basis this allows for the netting of natural offsets and lowers transaction costs and net exposures where possible we seek to manage our foreign exchange risk in part through operational means including matching samecurrency revenues to samecurrency costs and samecurrency assets to samecurrency liabilities moreover weakening in one currency can often be offset by strengthening in another currency foreign exchange risk is also managed through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts positions are primarily in euro swiss franc british pound japanese yen and korean won the majority of forward contracts are for periods of 90 days or less we record the change in value of our foreign currency receivables and payables as a foreign exchange gain loss on our consolidated statements of income along with the change in fair market value of the forward exchange contract used as an economic hedge of those assets or liabilities 

our forward contract holdings at yearend were analyzed to determine their sensitivity to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates all other variables were held constant market risk associated with derivative holdings is the potential change in fair value of derivative positions arising from an adverse movement in foreign exchange rates a 10 depreciation  appreciation on quoted foreign exchange rates related to the company’s contracts would result in an approximate netpresentvalue loss  gain of 328 million on our derivative position as of december 31 2021 the gains or losses on forward currencyexchange contracts resulting from changes in currency exchange rates are expected to approximately offset losses or gains on the exposures being hedged this impact of a change in exchange rates excludes the offset derived from the change in value of the underlying assets and liabilities which could reduce the adverse effect significantly 

interest rate risk of debt instruments biorad centrally manages the shortterm cash surpluses and shortfalls of its subsidiaries our holdings of variable rate debt instruments at yearend were analyzed to determine their sensitivity to movements in interest rates due to the relatively small amount of shortterm variable rate debt instruments we have outstanding there would not be a material impact to earnings or cash flows if interest rates moved adversely by 10 our holdings of longterm debt instruments consist primarily of fixedrate instruments and are thus insulated from interest rate changes as of december 31 2021 the overall interest rate risk associated with our debt instruments was not significant 




 item 9 changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure 

not applicable 




 i tem 9a controls and procedures 

a evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

we maintain “disclosure controls and procedures” as such term is defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended “exchange act” that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in securities and exchange commission rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer ceo and chief financial officer cfo as appropriate to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure in designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures management recognized that disclosure controls and procedures no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met additionally in designing disclosure controls and procedures our management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the costbenefit relationship of possible disclosure controls and procedures the design of any disclosure controls and procedures also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions 

subject to the limitations noted above our management with the participation of our ceo and cfo has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the year covered by this annual report on form 10k based on that evaluation our ceo and cfo concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to meet the objective for which they were designed and operate at the reasonable assurance level 

b management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the company as defined in rule 13a15f or 15d15f of the exchange act our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that i pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the company’s assets ii provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors and iii provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 

our management assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2021 using the criteria established in internal control  integrated framework 2013 issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso based on this assessment and those criteria management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 2021 our internal control over financial reporting has been audited by kpmg llp an independent registered public accounting firm as stated in their report which appears in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

c changes in internal control over financial reporting 

management continuously reviews disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting and accordingly may from time to time make changes aimed at enhancing their effectiveness to ensure that its systems evolve with its business there were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the exchange act during the year ended december 31 2021 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

d inherent limitations on effectiveness of internal controls 

because of its inherent limitations our internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate

 item 1 business tableend

general 

biorad laboratories inc referred to in this report as “biorad” “we” “us” and “our” is a multinational manufacturer and worldwide distributor of our own life science research and clinical diagnostics products biorad manufactures and supplies the life science research healthcare analytical chemistry and other markets with a broad range of products and systems used to separate complex chemical and biological materials and to identify analyze and purify their components 

we have direct distribution channels in over 36 countries outside the united states through subsidiaries whose focus is sales customer service and product distribution in some locations outside and inside these 36 countries sales efforts are supplemented by distributors and agents 

description of business 

business segments 

biorad operates in two industry segments designated as life science and clinical diagnostics both segments operate worldwide our life science segment and our clinical diagnostics segment generated 49 and 51 respectively of our net sales for the year ended december 31 2020 we generated approximately 39 of our consolidated net sales for the year ended december 31 2020 from us sales and approximately 61 from sales in our remaining worldwide markets 

life science segment 

our life science segment is at the forefront of discovery creating advanced tools to answer complex biological questions we are a leader in the life sciences market and develop manufacture and market approximately 6000 reagents apparatus and laboratory instruments that serve a global customer base many of our products are used in established research techniques biopharmaceutical production processes and food testing regimes these techniques are typically used to separate purify and identify biological materials such as proteins nucleic acids and bacteria within a laboratory or production setting we focus on selected segments of the life sciences market in proteomics the study of proteins genomics the study of genes biopharmaceutical production cellular biology and food safety we estimate that the worldwide market that our portfolios can address for products in these selected segments of our addressable markets is approximately 14 billion our principal life science customers include universities and medical schools industrial research organizations government agencies pharmaceutical manufacturers biotechnology researchers food producers and food testing laboratories these tools are typically used to separate purify characterize or quantitate biological materials such as cells proteins and nucleic acids in the research laboratory or the biopharmaceutical manufacturing and quality control process for food safety and science education and literacy we are focused on the translational research market segment where our products help accelerate the timelines from discovery in the lab to the clinic and the patient 

clinical diagnostics segment 

our clinical diagnostics segment designs manufactures sells and supports test systems informatics systems test kits and specialized quality controls that serve clinical laboratories in the global diagnostics market our products currently address specific niches within the in vitro diagnostics ivd test market and we seek to focus on the higher margin higher growth segments of this market 

we supply more than 3000 different products that cover more than 300 clinical diagnostic tests to the ivd test market we estimate that the worldwide sales for products in the markets we serve is approximately 16 billion ivd tests are conducted outside the human body and are used to identify and measure substances in a patient’s tissue blood or urine our products consist of reagents instruments and software typically provided to our customers as an integrated package to allow them to generate reproducible test results revenue in this business is highly recurring as laboratories typically standardize test methodologies which are dependent on a particular supplier’s equipment reagents and consumable products an installed base of diagnostic test systems therefore typically creates an ongoing source of revenue through the sale of test kits for each sample analyzed on an installed system our principal clinical diagnostic customers include hospital laboratories diagnostic reference laboratories transfusion laboratories and physician office laboratories 

raw materials and components 

we utilize a wide variety of chemicals biological materials electronic components machined metal parts optical parts computing and peripheral devices most of these materials and components are available from numerous sources and while we have historically not experienced difficulty in securing adequate supplies the impact of covid19 on our suppliers operations has created some challenges in procuring materials for more discussion relating to the impacts of the covid19 pandemic please see “item 1a risk factors” to this annual report in certain instances we acquire components and materials from a sole supplier due to the regulatory environment in which we operate we may be unable to quickly establish additional or replacement sources for some components or materials 

patents trademarks and licenses 

we own over 2200 us and international patents and numerous trademarks we also hold licenses under us and foreign patents owned by third parties and pay royalties on the sales of certain products under these licenses we view these patents trademarks and license agreements as valuable assets however we believe that our ability to develop and manufacture our products depends primarily on our knowledge technology and special skills rather than our patent trademark and licensing positions 

seasonal operations and backlog 

our business is not inherently seasonal however the european custom of concentrating vacation during the summer months usually tempers third quarter sales volume and operating income 

for the most part we operate in markets characterized by short lead times and the absence of significant backlogs management has concluded that backlog information is not material to our business as a whole 

sales and marketing 

we conduct our worldwide operations through an extensive direct sales force employing approximately 880 direct sales and sales management personnel around the world our sales force typically consists of experienced industry professionals with scientific training and we maintain a separate specialist sales force for each of our segments we believe that this direct sales approach allows us to sell a broader range of our products that creates more brand awareness and longterm relationships with our customers 

we also use a range of sales and marketing intermediaries smis in our international markets the types of smis we utilize are distributors agents brokers and resellers we have programs and policies in place with our smis to ensure their compliance with all applicable laws including adhering to our anticorruption standards to ensure a transparent sale to our customers 

our customer base is broad and diversified our worldwide customer base includes 1 prominent university and research institutions 2 hospital public health and commercial laboratories 3 other leading diagnostic manufacturers and 4 leading companies in the biotechnology pharmaceutical chemical and food industries 

our sales are affected by a number of external factors for example a number of our customers particularly in the life science segment are substantially dependent on government grants and research contracts for their funding 

most of our international sales are generated by our whollyowned international subsidiaries and their branch offices certain of these subsidiaries also have manufacturing operations biorad’s international operations are subject to certain risks common to foreign operations in general such as changes in governmental regulations import restrictions and foreign exchange fluctuations 

competition 

the markets served by our product groups are highly competitive our competitors range in size from startups to large multinational corporations with significant resources and reach we seek to compete primarily in market segments where our products and technology offer customers specific advantages over the competition 

our life science segment does not face the same competitors for all of its products due to the breadth of its product lines major competitors in this market include becton dickinson ge biosciences merck millipore and thermo fisher scientific we compete primarily based on meeting performance specifications and offering comprehensive solutions 

major competitors of our clinical diagnostics segment include roche abbott laboratories siemens danaher thermo fisher becton dickinson biomérieux ortho clinical diagnostics tosoh immucor and diasorin we compete across a variety of attributes including service quality and portfolio 

research and development 

we conduct extensive research and development activities in all areas of our business employing approximately 880 employees worldwide in these activities including degreed scientists and technical support staff research and development has played a major role in biorad’s growth and is expected to continue to do so in the future our research teams are continuously developing new products and new applications for existing products in our development of new products and applications we interact with scientific and medical professionals at universities hospitals and medical schools and within our industry 

regulatory matters 

the development testing manufacturing marketing postmarket surveillance distribution advertising and labeling of certain of our products primarily diagnostic and donor screening products are subject to regulation in the united states by the center for devices and radiological health cdrh andor the center for biologics evaluation and research cber of the us food and drug administration fda and in other jurisdictions by state and foreign government authorities fda regulations require that some new products have premarketing clearance or approval by the fda and require certain products to be manufactured in accordance with fda’s “good manufacturing practice” regulations to be extensively tested and to be properly labeled to disclose test results and performance claims and limitations after a product that is subject to fda regulation is placed on the market numerous regulatory requirements apply including for example the requirement that we comply with recordkeeping and reporting requirements such as the fda’s medical device reporting regulations and reporting of corrections and removals the fda enforces these requirements by inspection and market surveillance the fda has authority to take various administrative and legal actions against us for our or our products’ failure to comply with relevant legal or regulatory requirements including issuing warning letters initiating product seizures requesting or requiring product recalls or withdrawals and other civil or criminal sanctions among other things 

we are also subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business such laws include without limitation state and federal antikickback fraud and abuse false claims privacy and security and physician sunshine laws and regulations if our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to us we may be subject to penalties including without limitation civil and criminal penalties damages fines the curtailment or restructuring of our operations exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment 

sales of our products will depend in part on the extent to which our products or diagnostic tests using our products will be covered by thirdparty payors such as government health care programs commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations these thirdparty payors are increasingly reducing reimbursements for certain medical products and services in addition the us government state legislatures and foreign governments have continued implementing cost containment programs including price controls and restrictions on reimbursement adoption of price controls and costcontainment measures and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures could further limit our net revenue and results decreases in thirdparty reimbursement for our products or diagnostic tests using our products or a decision by a thirdparty payor to not cover our products could reduce or eliminate utilization of our products and have a material adverse effect on our sales results of operations and financial condition in addition healthcare reform measures have been and will be adopted in the future any of which could limit the amounts that governments will pay for healthcare products and services which could result in reduced demand for our products or additional pricing pressures 

as a multinational manufacturer and distributor of sophisticated instrumentation we must meet a wide array of electromagnetic compatibility and safety compliance requirements to satisfy regulations in the united states the european union and other jurisdictions 

our operations are subject to federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations that govern such activities as transportation of goods emissions to air and discharges to water as well as handling and disposal practices for solid hazardous and medical wastes in addition to environmental laws that regulate our operations we are also subject to environmental laws and regulations that create liabilities and cleanup responsibility for spills disposals or other releases of hazardous substances into the environment as a result of our operations or otherwise impacting real property that we own or operate the environmental laws and regulations could also subject us to claims by third parties for damages resulting from any spills disposals or releases resulting from our operations or at any of our properties 

these regulatory requirements vary widely among countries

 item 1a risk factors 

in evaluating our business and whether to invest in any of our securities you should carefully read the following risk factors in addition to the other information contained in this annual report we believe that any of the following risks could have a material effect on our business results of operations or financial condition our industry or the trading price of our common stock we operate in a continually changing business environment and new risks and uncertainties emerge from time to time we cannot predict these new risks and uncertainties nor can we assess the extent to which any such new risks and uncertainties or the extent to which the risks and uncertainties set forth below may adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition our industry or the trading price of our common stock please carefully consider the following discussion of significant factors events and uncertainties that make an investment in our securities risky and provide important information for the understanding of the “forwardlooking” statements discussed this annual report in addition to the effects of the covid19 pandemic and resulting global disruptions on our business and operations discussed in this annual report additional or unforeseen effects from the covid19 pandemic and the global economic climate may give rise to or amplify many of these risks discussed below 

business economic legal and industry risks 

pandemics or disease outbreaks such as the covid19 pandemic have affected and could materially adversely affect our business operations financial condition and results of operations 

the covid19 pandemic is having and is expected to continue to have an adverse effect on the united states and global economies as well as on aspects of our operations and those of third parties on whom we rely the covid19 pandemic has impacted and we expect will continue to impact parts of our business operations financial condition and results of operations in a variety of ways 

although demand has increased for certain of our products being used in fighting the covid19 pandemic we are experiencing a decrease in product demand with reduced sales activity and customer orders in a number of our businesses many of our customers have reduced or modified operations resulting in labs universities and other customers facilities being closed or opened at reduced capacity hospital visits have declined as people delay elective surgeries and avoid nonessential trips to the hospital and routine diagnostic testing has slowed although certain locations have experienced an improvement in conditions related to the pandemic we expect that parts of our business will continue to suffer negative impacts from the pandemic even as conditions improve in some locations 

on the supply side we are experiencing challenges with the supply of raw materials and components used in the production of our products with suppliers operating at reduced or modified capacity and otherwise unable to meet our increased demand for raw materials and inputs to manufacture our products being used in fighting the covid19 pandemic in addition we are experiencing transportation challenges in moving goods across regions including reduced freight availability as many airlines have significantly scaled back flight operations and increased freight surcharges due to reduced freight capacity countries have closed their borders and imposed travel restrictions and may continue to impose measures that restrict the movement of our goods the invocation by the us federal government of the defense production act of 1950 with respect to our manufacturing operations or the enforcement of comparable laws by other governmental entities could disrupt our manufacturing and distribution operations 

with respect to our personnel as a critical health care supplier we continue to keep certain essential production distribution and service teams onsite working in manufacturing and supply chain facilities throughout the world although we are adhering to government mandated and environmental health and safety protocols an outbreak of covid19 at one or more of our facilities could nonetheless cause shutdowns of facilities and a reduction in our workforce which could dramatically affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results 

the duration of the covid19 pandemic is unknown even with the distribution of a vaccine and it is difficult to predict the full extent of potential impacts the pandemic will have in the future on our business operations and financial results or on our customers suppliers logistics providers or on the global economy as a whole 

 

our international operations expose us to additional costs and legal and regulatory risks which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we have significant international operations we have direct distribution channels in over 36 countries outside the united states and for the year ended december 31 2020 our foreign entities generated 61 of our net sales compliance with complex foreign and us laws and regulations that apply to our international operations increases our cost of doing business these numerous and sometimes conflicting laws and regulations include among others data privacy requirements labor relations laws tax laws anticompetition regulations import and trade restrictions tariffs duties quotas and other trade barriers export requirements us laws such as the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa and other us federal laws and regulations established by the office of foreign asset control foreign laws such as the uk bribery act 2010 or other foreign laws which prohibit corrupt payments to governmental officials or certain payments or remunerations to customers in addition changes in laws or regulations potentially could be disruptive to our operations and business relationships in the affected regions for example the united kingdoms withdrawal from the european union commonly referred to as “brexit” could disrupt the free movement of goods services and people between the united kingdom and the european union and result in increased regulatory legal labor and tax complexities 

given the high level of complexity of the foreign and us laws and regulations that apply to our international operations there is a risk that we may inadvertently breach some provisions for example through fraudulent or negligent behavior of individual employees our failure to comply with certain formal documentation requirements or otherwise our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate these risks and manage these challenges through policies procedures and internal controls however we have a dispersed international sales organization and we use distributors and agents in many of our international operations this structure makes it more difficult for us to ensure that our international selling operations comply with laws and regulations and our global policies and procedures 

violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines criminal sanctions against us our officers or our employees requirements to obtain export licenses cessation of business activities in sanctioned countries implementation of compliance programs and prohibitions on the conduct of our business violations of laws and regulations also could result in prohibitions on our ability to offer our products in one or more countries and could materially damage our reputation our brand our international expansion efforts our ability to attract and retain employees or our business results of operations and financial condition as previously disclosed we entered into a nonprosecution agreement npa with the us department of justice doj and the securities and exchange commission sec and consented to the entry of an order by the sec sec order effective november 3 2014 which actions resolved both the doj and the sec investigations into our violations of the fcpa any future violations of the fcpa could result in more punitive actions by the sec and doj andor could harm our reputation with customers either of which could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition see also our risk factors regarding the covid19 pandemic above and regarding government regulations and global economic conditions below 

the industries and market segments in which we operate are highly competitive and we may not be able to compete effectively 

the life science and clinical diagnostics markets are each highly competitive some of our competitors have greater financial resources than we do making them better equipped to license technologies and intellectual property from third parties or to fund research and development manufacturing and marketing efforts moreover competitive and regulatory conditions in many markets in which we operate restrict our ability to fully recover through price increases higher costs of acquired goods and services resulting from inflation and other drivers of cost increases many public tenders have become more competitive due to governments lengthening the commitments of their public tenders to multiple years which reduce the number of tenders in which we can participate annually because the value of these multipleyear tenders is so high our competitors have been more aggressive with their pricing our failure to compete effectively andor pricing pressures resulting from competition could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

we may not be able to grow our business because of our failure to develop new or improved products 

our future growth depends in part on our ability to continue to improve our product offerings and develop and introduce new product lines and extensions that integrate technological advances in particular we may not be able to keep up with changes in the clinical diagnostics industry such as the trend toward molecular diagnostics or pointofcare tests if we are unable to integrate technological advances into our product offerings or to design develop manufacture and market new product lines and extensions successfully and in a timely manner our business results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected the covid19 pandemic may delay our ability to develop and introduce new products we have experienced product launch delays in the past and may do so in the future we cannot assure you that our product and process development efforts will be successful or that new products we introduce will achieve market acceptance failure to launch successful new products or improvements to existing products may cause our products to become obsolete which could harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

breaches of our information systems could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

we have experienced and expect to continue to experience attempts by computer programmers and hackers to attack and penetrate our layered security controls like the december 2019 cyberattack that was previously discussed in item 7 of our annual report for the period ended december 31 2019 through our sales and ecommerce channels we collect and store confidential information that customers provide to among other things purchase products or services enroll in promotional programs and register on our web site we also acquire and retain information about suppliers and employees in the normal course of business such information on our systems includes personally identifiable information and in limited instances protected health information we also create and maintain proprietary information that is critical to our business such as our product designs and manufacturing processes despite recent initiatives to improve our technology systems such as our enterprise resource planning implementation and the centralization of our global information technology organization we could experience a significant data security breach increased use of remote work arrangements and rapidly evolving work scenarios in response to the covid19 pandemic expose us to additional risk of cyberattack and disruption because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target we may not be able to anticipate all of these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures computer hackers have attempted to penetrate and will likely continue to attempt to penetrate our and our vendors’ information systems and if successful could misappropriate confidential customer supplier employee or other business information such as our intellectual property third parties could also gain control of our systems and use them for criminal purposes while appearing to be us as a result we could lose existing customers have difficulty attracting new customers be exposed to claims from customers financial institutions payment card associations employees and other persons have regulatory sanctions or penalties imposed incur additional expenses or lose revenues as a result of a data privacy breach or suffer other adverse consequences our operations and ability to process sales orders particularly through our ecommerce 

channels could also be disrupted as they were in the december 2019 cyberattack any significant breakdown intrusion interruption corruption or destruction of our systems as well as any data breaches could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations see also our risk factors regarding our information technology systems and our enterprise resource planning system erp implementation below 

if our information technology systems are disrupted or if we fail to successfully implement manage and integrate our information technology and reporting systems our business results of operations and financial condition could be harmed 

our information technology it systems are an integral part of our business and a serious disruption of our it systems could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition we depend on our it systems to process orders manage inventory and collect accounts receivable our it systems also allow us to efficiently purchase products from our suppliers and ship products to our customers on a timely basis maintain costeffective operations and provide customer service we may experience disruption of our it systems due to redundancy issues with our network servers we cannot assure you that our contingency plans will allow us to operate at our current level of efficiency 

our ability to implement our business plan in a rapidly evolving market requires effective planning reporting and analytical processes we expect that we will need to continue to improve and further integrate our it systems reporting systems and operating procedures by training and educating our employees with respect to these improvements and integrations on an ongoing basis in order to effectively run our business we may suffer interruptions in service loss of data or reduced functionality when we upgrade or change systems if we fail to successfully manage and integrate our it systems reporting systems and operating procedures it could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition see also our risk factors regarding our data security above and erp implementation and events beyond our control below 

we are subject to foreign currency exchange fluctuations which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

as stated above a significant portion of our operations and sales are outside of the united states when we make purchases and sales in currencies other than the us dollars we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar that may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition our international sales are largely denominated in local currencies as a result the strengthening of the us dollar negatively impacts our consolidated net sales expressed in us dollars conversely when the us dollar weakens our expenses at our international sites increase in addition the volatility of other currencies may negatively impact our operations outside of the united states and increase our costs to hedge against currency fluctuations we cannot assure you that future shifts in currency exchange rates will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

changes in the market value of our position in sartorius ag materially impact our financial results and might cause us to be deemed an investment company 

changes in the market value of our position in sartorius ag may continue to materially impact our consolidated statements of income and other financial statements a decline in the market value of our position in sartorius ag could result in significant losses due to writedowns in the value of the equity securities an increase in the market value of our position in sartorius ag could result in a significant and favorable impact to net income independent of the actual operating performance of our business as a result of the market value of our position in sartorius ag we might be deemed to be an “investment company” under section 3a1c of the investment company act of 1940 as amended the “investment company act” even though we are primarily engaged in a business other than that of investing reinvesting owning holding or trading in securities because the company might be deemed an investment company under the investment company act based on the market value of our position in sartorius ag alone the company has limited access to the capital markets and may not be able to obtain additional financing until it is determined that the company is not an investment company the company does not believe it is an investment company and intends to continue to conduct our operations so that we will not be deemed an investment company if the company were deemed to be an investment company such determination could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our share price may change significantly based upon changes in the market valuation of sartorius ag and such change may be unrelated to the actual performance of our business nonoperating income for a period may be significantly impacted by the timing of dividends paid by sartorius ag particularly in comparison to prior year periods 

we may incur losses in future periods due to writedowns in the value of financial instruments 

we have positions in a variety of financial instruments including asset backed securities and other similar instruments financial markets are volatile particularly in light of the covid19 pandemic and the markets for these securities can be illiquid the value of these securities will continue to be impacted by external market factors including default rates changes in the value of the underlying property such as residential or commercial real estate rating agency actions the prices at which observable market transactions occur and the financial strength of various entities such as financial guarantors who provide insurance for the securities should we need to convert these positions to cash we may not be able to sell these instruments without significant losses due to current debtor financial conditions or other market considerations 

we also have positions in equity securities including our position in sartorius ag financial markets are volatile and the markets for these equity securities can be illiquid as well a decline in the market value of our investments in equity securities that we own could result in significant losses due to writedowns in the value of the equity securities in addition if we need to convert these positions to cash we may not be able to sell these equity securities without significant losses 

we may experience difficulties implementing our new global enterprise resource planning system 

we are engaged in a multiyear implementation of a new global enterprise resource planning system erp the erp is designed to efficiently maintain our books and records and provide information important to the operation of our business to our management team the erp will continue to require significant investment of human and financial resources in implementing the erp we may experience significant delays increased costs and other difficulties as we already have with some of our earlier deployments any significant disruption or deficiency in the design and implementation of the erp could adversely affect our ability to process orders ship product send invoices and track payments fulfill contractual obligations or otherwise operate our business we expect to implement the remaining smaller phases of the erp platform over the next few years in addition our efforts to centralize various business processes and functions within our organization in connection with our erp implementation may continue to disrupt our operations and negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition 

recent and planned changes to our organizational structure could negatively impact our business 

we made significant changes to our organizational structure over the past few years we have continued to reorganize aspects of our european operations since 2016 including the reorganization announced in february 2021 at the beginning of 2020 we restructured the clinical diagnostics segment based on functional groups rather than product line divisions these changes may have unintended consequences such as distraction of our management and employees business disruption attrition of our workforce inability to attract or retain key employees and reduced employee morale or productivity 

risks relating to intellectual property rights may negatively impact our business 

we rely on a combination of copyright trade secret patent and trademark laws and thirdparty nondisclosure agreements to protect our intellectual property rights and products however we cannot assure you that our intellectual property rights will not be challenged invalidated circumvented or rendered unenforceable or that meaningful protection or adequate remedies will be available to us for instance unauthorized third parties have attempted to copy our intellectual property reverse engineer or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary or have developed equivalent technologies independently and may do so in the future additionally third parties have asserted patent copyright and other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to us and may do so in the future if we are unable to license or otherwise access protected technology used in our products or if we lose our rights under any existing licenses we could be prohibited from manufacturing and marketing such products from time to time we also must enforce our patents or other intellectual property rights or defend ourselves against claimed infringement of the rights of others through litigation as a result we could incur substantial costs be forced to redesign our products or be required to pay damages or royalties to an infringed party any of the foregoing matters could adversely impact our business results of operations and financial condition 

global economic and geopolitical conditions could adversely affect our operations 

in recent years we have been faced with very challenging global economic conditions the covid19 pandemic as discussed above is currently causing disruptions to global economic conditions it is unknown how long such disruptions will continue and whether such disruptions will become more severe a deterioration in the global economic environment may and is currently resulting generally in decreased demand for our products other than with respect to certain of our products being used in fighting the covid19 pandemic increased competition downward pressure on the prices for our products and longer sales cycles a weakening of macroeconomic conditions may and currently is also adversely affecting our suppliers which could result in interruptions in supply in the future additionally the united states and other countries such as china and india recently have imposed tariffs on certain goods while tariffs imposed by other countries on us goods have not yet had a significant impact on our business further escalation of tariffs or other trade barriers could adversely impact our profitability andor our competitiveness see also our risk factors regarding the covid19 pandemic and our international operations above and regarding government regulations below 

reductions in government funding and the capital spending programs of our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

our customers include universities clinical diagnostics laboratories government agencies hospitals and pharmaceutical biotechnology and chemical companies the capital spending programs of these institutions and companies have a significant effect on the demand for our products such programs are based on a wide variety of factors including the resources available to make such purchases the availability of funding from grants by governments or government agencies the spending priorities for various types of equipment and the policies regarding capital expenditures during industry downturns or recessionary periods if government funding to our customers were to decrease or if our customers were to decrease or reallocate their budgets in a manner adverse to us our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

changes in the healthcare industry could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

there have been and will continue to be significant changes in the healthcare industry in an effort to reduce costs these changes include 

• the trend towards managed care together with healthcare reform of the delivery system in the united states and efforts to reform in europe has resulted in increased pressure on healthcare providers and other participants in the healthcare industry to reduce selling prices consolidation among healthcare providers and consolidation among other participants in the healthcare industry has resulted in fewer more powerful groups whose purchasing power gives them cost containment leverage in particular there has been a consolidation of laboratories and a consolidation of blood transfusion centers these industry trends and competitive forces place constraints on the levels of overall pricing and thus could have a material adverse effect on our gross margins for products we sell in clinical diagnostic markets 

• third party payors such as medicare and medicaid in the united states have reduced their reimbursements for certain medical products and services our clinical diagnostics business is impacted by the level of reimbursement available for clinical tests from third party payors in the united states payment for many diagnostic tests furnished to medicare feeforservice beneficiaries is made based on the medicare clinical laboratory fee schedule clfs a fee schedule established and adjusted from time to time by the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms some commercial payors are guided by the clfs in establishing their reimbursement rates laboratories and clinicians may decide not to order or perform certain clinical diagnostic tests if third party payments are inadequate and we cannot predict whether third party payors will offer adequate reimbursement for tests utilizing our products to make them commercially attractive legislation such as the patient protection and affordable care act as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act ppaca and the middle class tax relief and job creation act of 2012 has reduced the payments for clinical laboratory services paid under the clfs in addition the protecting access to medicare act of 2014 pama has made significant changes to the way medicare will pay for clinical laboratory services which has further reduced reimbursement rates 

to the extent that the healthcare industry seeks to address the need to contain costs stemming from reform measures such as those contained in the ppaca and the pama or in future legislation by limiting the number of clinical tests being performed or the amount of reimbursement available for such tests our business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected if these changes in the healthcare markets in the united states and europe continue we could be forced to alter our approach in selling marketing distributing and servicing our products 

we are subject to substantial government regulation and any changes in regulation or violations of regulations by us could adversely affect our business prospects results of operations or financial condition 

some of our products primarily our clinical diagnostic products production processes and marketing are subject to us federal state and local and foreign regulation including by the fda in the united states and its foreign counterparts the fda regulates our clinical diagnostic products as medical devices and we are subject to significant regulatory clearances or approvals to market our clinical diagnostic products and other requirements including for example recordkeeping and reporting requirements such as the fda’s medical device reporting regulations and reporting of corrections and removals the fda has broad regulatory and enforcement powers if the fda determines that we have failed to comply with applicable regulatory requirements it can impose a variety of enforcement actions ranging from public warning letters fines injunctions consent decrees and civil penalties to suspension or delayed issuance of approvals seizure or recall of our products total or partial shutdown of production withdrawal of approvals or clearances already granted and criminal prosecution 

the fda can also require us to repair replace or refund the cost of devices that we manufactured or distributed 

in addition the fda may change its clearance and approval policies adopt additional regulations or revise existing regulations or take other actions which may prevent or delay approval or clearance of our products or impact our ability to modify our currently approved or cleared products on a timely basis changes in the fda’s review of certain clinical diagnostic products referred to as laboratory developed tests which are tests developed by a single laboratory for use only in that laboratory could affect some of our customers who use our life science instruments for laboratory developed tests in the past the fda has chosen to not enforce applicable regulations and has not reviewed such tests for approval however the fda has issued draft guidance that it may begin enforcing its medical device requirements including premarket submission requirements to such tests any delay in or failure to receive or maintain clearance or approval for our products could prevent us from generating revenue from these products and adversely affect our business operations and financial results additionally the fda and other regulatory authorities have broad enforcement powers regulatory enforcement or inquiries or other increased scrutiny on us could affect the perceived safety and efficacy of our products and dissuade our customers from using our products 

many foreign governments have similar rules and regulations regarding the importation registration labeling sale and use of our products such agencies may also impose new requirements that may require us to modify or reregister products already on the market or otherwise impact our ability to market our products in those countries for example in april 2017 the european parliament voted to enact final regulations that include broad changes regarding in vitro diagnostic devices and medical devices which will require us to modify or reregister some products and will result in additional costs in addition russia has enacted more stringent medical product registration and labeling regulations china has enacted stricter labeling requirements and we expect other countries such as brazil and india to impose more regulations that impact our product registrations brexit also will likely result in additional regulatory requirements associated with goods sold in the united kingdom and will likely result in additional complexities and possible delays with respect to goods raw materials and personnel moving between the united kingdom and the european union in addition new government administrations may interpret existing regulations or practices differently for example the mexican health regulatory agency cofepris in 2019 cited biorad’s mexican subsidiary for operating practices that had been endorsed by a prior administration which has impacted our ability to conduct our clinical diagnostics business in mexico due to these evolving and diverse requirements we face uncertain product approval timelines additional time and effort to comply as well as the potential for reduced sales andor fines for noncompliance increasing protectionism in such countries also impedes our ability to compete with local companies for example we may not be able to participate in certain public tenders in russia because of increasing measures to restrict access to such tenders for companies without local manufacturing capabilities certain tenders in china and india also are including local manufacturing preferences or requirements such regulations could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition see also our risk factors regarding our international operations and regarding global economic and geopolitical conditions above 

we are also subject to government regulation of the use and handling of a number of materials and controlled substances the us drug enforcement administration establishes registration security recordkeeping reporting storage distribution and other requirements for controlled substances pursuant to the controlled substances act of 1970 failure to comply with present or future laws and regulations could result in substantial liability to us suspension or cessation of our operations restrictions on our ability to expand at our present locations or require us to make significant capital expenditures or incur other significant expenses 

we cannot assure you that we will be able to integrate acquired companies products or technologies into our company successfully or we may not be able to realize the anticipated benefits from the acquisitions 

as part of our overall business strategy we pursue acquisitions of and investments in complementary companies products and technologies the benefits of any acquisition may prove to be less than anticipated and may not outweigh the costs reported in our financial statements completing any potential future acquisitions could cause significant diversion of our management’s time and resources if we acquire new companies products or technologies we may be required to assume contingent liabilities or record impairment charges for goodwill and other intangible assets over time goodwill and nonamortizable intangible assets are subject to impairment testing and potential periodic goodwill impairment charges amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets and other writeoffs could harm our operating results impairment tests are highly sensitive to changes in assumptions and minor changes to assumptions could result in impairment losses if the results forecast in our impairment tests are not achieved or business trends vary from the assumptions used in forecasts or external factors change detrimentally future impairment losses may occur as they have occurred in the past we cannot assure you that we will successfully overcome these risks or any other problems we encounter in connection with any acquisitions and any such acquisitions could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

product quality and liability issues could harm our reputation and negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition 

we must adequately address quality issues associated with our products including defects in our engineering design and manufacturing processes as well as defects in thirdparty components included in our products our instruments reagents and consumables are complex and identifying the root cause of quality issues especially those affecting reagents or thirdparty components is difficult we may incur significant costs and expend substantial time in researching and remediating such issues quality issues could also delay our launching or manufacturing of new products in addition quality issues unapproved uses of our products or inadequate disclosure of risks related to our products could result in product recalls or product liability or other claims being brought against us these issues could harm our reputation impair our relationship with existing customers and harm our ability to attract new customers which could negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition 

lack of key personnel could hurt our business 

our products are very technical in nature in general only highly qualified and welltrained scientists have the necessary skills to develop market and sell our products and many of our manufacturing positions require very specialized knowledge and skills in addition the global nature of our business also requires that we have sophisticated and experienced staff to comply with increasingly complex international laws and regulations we face intense competition for these professionals from our competitors customers marketing partners and other companies throughout our industry in particular the job market in northern california where many of our employees are located is very competitive if we do not offer competitive compensation and benefits we may fail to retain or attract a sufficient number of qualified personnel which could impair our ability to properly run our business 

a reduction or interruption in the supply of components and raw materials could adversely affect our manufacturing operations and related product sales 

the manufacture of many of our products requires the timely delivery of sufficient amounts of quality components and materials we manufacture our products in numerous manufacturing facilities around the world we acquire our components and materials from many suppliers in various countries we work closely with our suppliers to ensure the continuity of supply but we cannot guarantee these efforts will always be successful further while we seek to diversify our sources of components and materials in certain instances we acquire components and materials from a sole supplier in addition due to the regulatory environment in which we operate we may be unable to quickly establish additional or replacement sources for some components or materials if our supply is reduced or interrupted or of poor quality and we are unable to develop alternative sources for such supply our ability to manufacture our products in a timely or costeffective manner could be adversely affected which would adversely affect our ability to sell our products see also our risk factor regarding the covid19 pandemic above 

we may have higher than anticipated tax liabilities 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and many foreign jurisdictions we report our results of operations based on our determination of the amount of taxes owed in various tax jurisdictions in which we operate the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires estimation judgment and calculations where the ultimate tax determination may not be certain our determination of our tax liabilities is subject to review or examination by tax authorities in various tax jurisdictions tax authorities have disagreed with our judgment in the past and may disagree with positions we take in the future resulting in assessments of additional taxes any adverse outcome of such review or examination could have a negative impact on our operating results and financial condition 

economic and political pressures to increase tax revenues in various jurisdictions may make resolving tax disputes more difficult for example in recent years the tax authorities in europe have disagreed with our tax positions related to hybrid debt research and development credits transfer pricing and indirect taxes among others we regularly assess the likelihood of the outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals 

changes in tax laws or rates changes in the interpretation of tax laws or changes in the jurisdictional mix of our earnings could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations 

on december 22 2017 the us enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act the “tax act” which made a number of substantial changes to how the united states imposes income tax on multinational corporations the us treasury internal revenue service and other standard setting bodies continue to issue guidance and interpretation relating to the tax act as future guidance is issued we may make adjustments to amounts previously reported that could materially impact our financial statements the tax effect of our position in sartorius ag and the jurisdictional mix of our earnings could continue to materially affect our financial results and cash flow in addition the adoption of some or all of the recommendations set forth in the organization for economic cooperation and development’s project on “base erosion and profit shifting” beps by tax authorities in the countries in which we operate could negatively impact our effective tax rate these recommendations focus on payments from affiliates in high tax jurisdictions to affiliates in lower tax jurisdictions and the activities that give rise to a taxable presence in a particular country 

environmental health and safety regulations and enforcement proceedings may negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition 

our operations are subject to federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations that govern such activities as transportation of goods emissions to air and discharges to water as well as handling and disposal practices for solid hazardous and medical wastes in addition to environmental laws that regulate our operations we are also subject to environmental laws and regulations that create liability and cleanup responsibility for spills disposals or other releases of hazardous substances into the environment as a result of our operations or otherwise impacting real property that we own or operate the environmental laws and regulations also subject us to claims by third parties for damages resulting from any spills disposals or releases resulting from our operations or at any of our properties we must also comply with various health and safety regulations in the united states and abroad in connection with our operations 

we may in the future incur capital and operating costs to comply with currently existing laws and regulations and possible new statutory enactments and these expenditures may be significant we have incurred and may in the future incur fines related to environmental matters andor liability for costs or damages related to spills or other releases of hazardous substances into the environment at sites where we have operated or at offsite locations where we have sent hazardous substances for disposal we cannot assure you however that such matters or any future obligations to comply with environmental or health and safety laws and regulations will not adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

our debt may restrict our future operations 

as of december 31 2020 we have a revolving credit facility that provides for up to 2000 million in borrowing capacity 02 million of which has been utilized for domestic standby letters of credit our existing credit facility and agreements we may enter in the future contain or may contain covenants imposing restrictions on our business these restrictions may affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise existing covenants place restrictions on our ability to among other things incur additional debt acquire other businesses or assets through merger or purchase create liens make investments enter into transactions with affiliates sell assets in the case of some of our subsidiaries guarantee debt and declare or pay dividends redeem stock or make other distributions to stockholders our existing credit facility also requires that we comply with certain financial ratios including a maximum consolidated leverage ratio test and a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio test our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control including prevailing economic financial and industry conditions the breach of any of these restrictions could result in a default an event of default under our debt agreements would permit some of our lenders to declare all amounts borrowed from them to be due and payable together with accrued and unpaid interest 

as noted above because the company might be deemed an investment company under the investment company act based on the market value of our position in sartorius ag the company may not be able to access the capital markets or otherwise obtain additional financing until it is determined that the company is not an investment company the inability to obtain additional financing may have a negative impact on the company’s existing business our ability to grow our business and our ability to make acquisitions 

we are subject to healthcare laws and regulations and could face substantial penalties if we are unable to fully comply with such laws 

we are subject to healthcare regulation and enforcement by both the us federal government and the us states and foreign governments in which we conduct our business these healthcare laws and regulations include for example 

• the us federal antikickback statute which prohibits among other things persons or entities from soliciting receiving offering or providing remuneration directly or indirectly in return for or to induce either the referral of an individual for or the purchase order or recommendation of any item or services for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as the medicare and medicaid programs 

• us federal false claims laws which prohibit among other things individuals or entities from knowingly presenting or causing to be presented claims for payment from medicare medicaid or other thirdparty payors that are false or fraudulent in addition the us federal government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal antikickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the false claims statutes 

• the us physician payment sunshine act which requires certain manufacturers of drugs biologics devices and medical supplies to record any transfers of value to us physicians and us teaching hospitals 

• the health insurance portability and accountability act hipaa as amended by the health information technology for economic and clinical health act which governs the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protects the security and privacy of protected health information and 

• state or foreign law equivalents of each of the us federal laws above such as antikickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any thirdparty payor including commercial insurers 

these laws will continue to impose administrative cost and compliance burdens on us the shifting compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust systems to comply with multiple jurisdictions with different compliance andor reporting requirements increases the possibility that a healthcare company may violate one or more of these requirements in addition any action against us for violation of these laws even if we successfully defend against it could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business if our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us we may be subject to penalties including civil and criminal penalties damages fines exclusion from the medicare and medicaid programs and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business results of operations and financial condition 

risks related to being a public company 

our failure to establish and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could result in material misstatements in our financial statements our failure to meet our reporting obligations and cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information which in turn could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline 

maintaining effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting are necessary for us to produce reliable financial statements material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting have adversely affected us in the past and could affect us in the future and the results of our periodic management evaluations and annual auditor attestation reports regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting required by section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 any failure to maintain or implement new or improved internal controls or any difficulties that we may encounter in their maintenance or implementation could result in additional material weaknesses result in material misstatements in our consolidated financial statements and cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations this could cause us to lose public confidence and could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline 

general business risks 

natural disasters terrorist attacks acts of war or other events beyond our control may cause damage or disruption to us and our employees facilities information systems security systems vendors and customers which could significantly impact our business results of operations and financial condition 

we have significant manufacturing and distribution facilities including in the western united states france switzerland germany and singapore in particular the western united states has experienced a number of earthquakes wildfires floods landslides and other natural disasters in recent years these occurrences could damage or destroy our facilities which may result in interruptions to our business and losses that exceed our insurance coverage in addition electricity outages strikes or other labor unrest at any of our sites or surrounding areas could cause disruption to our business acts of terrorism bioterrorism violence or war or public health issues such as the outbreak of a contagious disease like covid19 could also affect the markets in which we operate our business operations and strategic plans political unrest may affect our sales in certain regions such as in southeast asia the middle east and eastern europe any of these events could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

risks related to our common stock 

a significant majority of our voting stock is held by the schwartz family which could lead to conflicts of interest 

we have two classes of voting stock class a common stock and class b common stock with a few exceptions holders of class a and class b common stock vote as a single class when voting as a single class each share of class a common stock is entitled to onetenth of a vote while each share of class b common stock has one vote in the election or removal of directors the classes vote separately and the holders of class a common stock are entitled to elect 25 of the board of directors with holders of class b common stock electing the remaining directors as a result of the schwartz familys ownership of our class a and class b common stock they are able to elect a majority of our directors effect fundamental changes in our direction and control matters affecting us including the determination of business opportunities that may be suitable for our company the schwartz family may exercise its control over us according to interests that are different from other investors’ or debtors’ interests in particular this concentration of ownership and voting power may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company 

the forum selection provision in our bylaws could increase costs to bring a claim discourage claims or limit the ability of the company’s stockholders to bring a claim in a judicial forum viewed by the stockholders as more favorable for disputes with the company or the company’s directors officers or other employees  

our bylaws provide that unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum the court of chancery of the state of delaware or if the court of chancery does not have jurisdiction another state court located within the state of delaware or if no state court located within the state of delaware has jurisdiction the federal district court for the district of delaware shall be the sole and exclusive forum for i any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the company ii any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director officer or other employee of the company to the company or the company’s stockholders iii any action arising pursuant to any provision of the general corporation law of the state of delaware the certificate of incorporation or the bylaws in each case as may be amended from time to time or iv any action asserting a claim against the company or any of its directors officers or other employees governed by the internal affairs doctrine of the state of delaware this choice of forum provision may increase costs to bring a claim discourage claims or limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with the company or the company’s directors officers or other employees which may discourage such lawsuits against the company or the company’s directors officers and other employees alternatively if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in the company’s bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action the company may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions 

application of the choice of forum provision may be limited in some instances by applicable law section 27 of the exchange act creates exclusive federal jurisdiction over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the exchange act or the rules and regulations thereunder as a result the choice of forum provision will not apply to actions arising under the exchange act or the rules and regulations thereunder section 22 of the securities act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the securities act or the rules and regulations thereunder subject to a limited exception for certain “covered class actions” there is uncertainty particularly in light of current litigation as to whether a court would enforce the choice of forum provision with respect to claims under the securities act our stockholders will not be deemed by operation of the company’s choice of forum provision to have waived claims arising under the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

this discussion should be read in conjunction with the information contained in our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes which are an integral part of the statements 

overview  we are a multinational manufacturer and worldwide distributor of our own life science research and clinical diagnostics products our business is organized into two reportable segments life science and clinical diagnostics with the mission to provide scientists with specialized tools needed for biological research and health care specialists with products needed for clinical diagnostics 

we sell more than 9000 products and services to a diverse client base comprised of scientific research healthcare education and government customers worldwide we do not disclose quantitative information about our different products and services as it is impractical to do so based primarily on the numerous products and services that we sell and the global markets that we serve 

we manufacture and supply our customers with a range of reagents apparatus and equipment to separate complex chemical and biological materials and to identify analyze and purify components because our customers require standardization for their experiments and test results much of our revenues are recurring 

we are impacted by the support of many governments for both research and healthcare the current global economic outlook is still uncertain as the need to control government social spending by many governments limits opportunities for growth adding to this uncertainty is the withdrawal of the united kingdom from the european union approximately 39 of our 2020 consolidated net sales are derived from the united states and approximately 61 are derived from international locations with europe being our largest international region the international sales are largely denominated in local currencies such as the euro swiss franc japanese yen chinese yuan and british sterling as a result our consolidated net sales expressed in dollars benefit when the us dollar weakens and suffer when the dollar strengthens when the us dollar strengthens we benefit from lower cost of sales from our own international manufacturing sites as well as nonus suppliers and from lower international operating expenses we regularly discuss our changes in revenue and expense categories in terms of both changing foreign exchange rates and in terms of a currency neutral basis if notable to explain the impact currency has on our results 

covid19 

the full impact of the covid19 pandemic is inherently uncertain at the time of this report the covid19 pandemic has impacted and we expect will continue to disrupt parts of our business operations impacting our financial conditions and results of operations in a variety of ways we saw strong demand for products associated with covid19 testing and related research however we saw lower demand for many of our products in the rest of our business for more discussion relating to the impacts of the covid19 pandemic please see item 1a risk factors to this annual report 

cyberattack 

as we previously disclosed on december 9 2019 on a form 8k filed with the securities and exchange commission sec we detected a cyberattack on our network on the evening of december 5 2019 pst and immediately took affected systems offline as part of our comprehensive response to contain the activity “december 2019 cyberattack” the virus was targeted at windowsbased systems and did not attack our global erp system sap and other nonwindowsbased systems critical systems were back online within a few days of the incident as part of our indepth investigation into this incident we engaged outside cyber security experts to assist us with investigation and remediation efforts we have found no evidence of unauthorized transfer or misuse of personal data and there is no indication that customer systems were affected 

we have insurance coverage for costs resulting from cyberattacks we did not pay a ransom in connection with this incident 

acquisitions 

on april 1 2020 the acquisition date we acquired all equity interests of celsee inc celsee for total consideration of 993 million including the estimated fair value of contingent consideration the contingent consideration of up to 600 million is payable in cash upon the achievement of certain net revenues for the period beginning on january 1 2021 and ending on december 31 2022 

celsee is a manufacturer of instruments and consumables for the isolation detection and analysis of single cells we believe this acquisition will complement our life science product offerings the acquisition was included in our life science segments results of operations from the acquisition date 

informatics divestiture 

in april 2020 we received 122 million for the sale of our informatics division which focused on providing and developing comprehensive highquality spectral databases and associated software the division was part of our other operations segment in connection with this sale we recorded an 117 million gain in other income net in the consolidated statements of income for the year ended december 31 2020 

restructurings 

on february 3 2021 we initiated a strategydriven restructuring plan in furtherance of our ongoing program to improve operating performance the restructuring plan primarily impacts our operations in europe and includes the elimination of certain positions the consolidation of certain functions and the relocation of certain manufacturing operations from europe to asia the restructuring plan is expected to eliminate a total of approximately 530 positions and the subsequent creation of a total of approximately 325 new positions we anticipate the restructuring plan will be implemented in phases and is expected to be substantially completed by the end of fiscal year 2022 

we estimate that as a result of this restructuring plan we will incur between approximately 125 million and 130 million in total cost which we anticipate will consist of i approximately 86 million cash expenditures in the form of onetime termination benefits to the affected employees including cash severance payments healthcare benefits and related transition assistance ii approximately 19 million in capital expenditures associated with the restructuring plan and iii between approximately 20 million and 25 million in onetime transition costs including employee transition costs supply chain costs and regulatory costs we anticipate that we will record approximately 80 million to 90 million of the charges related to this restructuring plan in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021 

the amounts are preliminary estimates based on the information currently available to management it is possible that additional charges and future cash payments could occur in relation to the restructuring actions 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the accompanying discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities and contingencies as of the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis we base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources however future events may cause us to change our assumptions and estimates which may require adjustment actual results could differ from these estimates we have determined that for the periods reported in this annual report on form 10k the following accounting policies and estimates are critical in understanding our financial condition and results of operations 

accounting for income taxes 

we operate in multiple jurisdictions and our profits are taxed pursuant to the tax laws of these jurisdictions our effective income tax rate may be affected by the changes in or interpretations of tax laws and tax agreements in any given jurisdiction utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards changes in geographical mix of income and expense and changes in our assessment of matters such as the ability to realize deferred tax assets as a result of these considerations we must estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate this process involves estimating current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included in the consolidated balance sheet 

we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income considering all available evidence such as historical levels of income expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax strategies when we determine that it is not more likely than not that we will realize all or part of our deferred tax assets an adjustment is charged to earnings in the period when such determination is made likewise if we later determine that it is more likely than not that all or a part of our deferred tax assets would be realized the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed 

we make certain estimates and judgments about the application of tax laws the expected resolution of uncertain tax positions and other matters surrounding the recognition and measurement of uncertain tax benefits in the event that uncertain tax positions are resolved for amounts different than our estimates or the related statutes of limitations expire without the assessment of additional income taxes we will be required to adjust the amounts of the related assets and liabilities in the period in which such events occur such adjustments may have a material impact on our income tax provision and our results of operations 

business acquisitions 

accounting for business acquisitions requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions especially at the acquisition date with respect to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed and preacquisition contingencies in a business combination we allocate the purchase price to the acquired business’ identifiable assets and liabilities at their acquisition date fair values the excess of the purchase price over the amount allocated to the identifiable assets and liabilities if any is recorded as goodwill 

to date the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in our business combinations have primarily consisted of acquired working capital and definitelived intangible assets the carrying value of acquired working capital approximates its fair value given the shortterm nature of these assets and liabilities we estimate the fair value of definitelived intangible assets acquired using a discounted cash flow approach which includes an analysis of the future cash flows expected to be generated by such assets and the risk associated with achieving such cash flows the key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow model include the discount rate that is applied to the discretely forecasted future cash flows to calculate the present value of those cash flows and the estimate of future cash flows attributable to the acquired intangible assets which include revenue operating expenses and taxes our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement as a result during the measurement period which may be up to one year from the acquisition date we may record adjustments to the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill 

goodwill 

goodwill represents the excess of a the aggregate of the fair value of consideration transferred in a business combination over b the fair value of assets acquired net of liabilities assumed goodwill is not amortized but is subject to annual impairment tests as described below 

we conduct a goodwill impairment analysis annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist or if a decision is made to sell or exit a business significant judgments are involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred such indicators may include deterioration in general economic conditions negative developments in equity and credit markets adverse changes in the markets in which an entity operates increases in input costs that have a negative effect on earnings and cash flows a trend of negative or declining cash flows a decline in actual or planned revenue or earnings compared with actual and projected results of relevant prior periods or other relevant entityspecific events such as changes in management key personnel strategy or customers contemplation of bankruptcy or litigation the fair value that could be realized in an actual transaction may differ from that used to evaluate the impairment of goodwill 

we first may assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test included in us gaap to the extent our assessment identifies adverse conditions or if we elect to bypass the qualitative assessment goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level using a quantitative impairment test 

for the year ended december 31 2020 we elected to perform a qualitative assessment and determined that impairment was not more likely than not and no further analysis was required 

intangible assets 

we acquired intangible assets in connection with certain of our business acquisitions these assets were recorded at their estimated fair values at the acquisition date and are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives using a method of amortization that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets are used estimated useful lives are determined based on our historical use of similar assets and the expectation of future realization of cash flows attributable to the intangible assets changes in circumstances such as technological advances or changes to our business model could result in the actual useful lives differing from our current estimates in those cases where we determine that the useful life of an intangible asset should be shortened we amortize the net book value in excess of the estimated salvage value over its revised remaining useful life we did not revise our previously assigned useful life estimates attributed to any of our intangible assets during the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 

the estimated useful lives used in computing amortization of intangible assets are as follows 

customer relationshipslists 4 – 16 years 

know how 14 years 

developed product technology 7 – 20 years 

licenses 12 – 13 years 

tradenames 10 – 15 years 

covenants not to compete 3 – 10 years 

impairment of longlived assets 

we review our longlived assets including property and equipment and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset or an asset group may not be recoverable typical indicators that an asset may be impaired include but are not limited to 

• a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a longlived asset is being used or in its physical condition 

• a currentperiod operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a longlived asset or 

• a current expectation that more likely than not a longlived asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life 

recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated recoverability measurement and estimating of undiscounted cash flows for assets to be held and used is done at the lowest possible levels for which there are identifiable cash flows if such assets are considered impaired generally the amount of impairment recognized would be equal to the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets which we would compute using a discounted cash flow approach assets to be disposed of are recorded at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell estimating future cash flows attributable to our longlived assets requires significant judgment and projections may vary from cash flows eventually realized there were no triggering events to cause us to record an impairment charge for the year ended december 31 2020 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue from operations through the sale of products services license of intellectual property and rental of instruments revenue from contracts with customers is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services we enter into contracts that can include various combinations of products and services which are generally accounted for as distinct performance obligations revenue is recognized net of any taxes collected from customers sales tax value added tax etc which are subsequently remitted to government authorities 

our contracts from customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment and may or may not impact the timing of revenue recognition revenue associated with equipment that requires factory installation is not recognized until installation is complete and customer acceptance if required has occurred certain equipment requires installation due to the fact that the instruments are being operated in a clinicallaboratory environment and the installation services could result in modification of the equipment in order to ensure that the instruments are working according to customer specifications which are subject to validation tests upon completion of the installation in these arrangements which require factory installation the delivery of the equipment and the installation are separate performance obligations we will recognize the transaction price allocated to the equipment only upon customer acceptance as the transfer of control in relation to the equipment has occurred at that point as the customer has the ability to direct the use of and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from the asset the transaction price allocated to the installation services is also recognized upon customer acceptance because without the completion of the installation services and related customer acceptance the customer cannot receive any of the benefits of the service 

at the time revenue is recognized a provision is recognized for estimated product returns as this right is considered variable consideration accordingly when product revenues are recognized the transaction price is reduced by the estimated amount of product returns 

service revenues on extended warranty contracts are recognized ratably over the life of the service agreement as a standready performance obligation for arrangements that include a combination of products and services the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation based on standalone selling prices the method used to determine the standalone selling prices for product and service revenues is based on the observable prices when the product or services have been sold separately 

the primary purpose of our invoicing terms is to provide customers with simple and predictable methods of purchasing our products and services not to either provide or receive financing to or from our customers we record contract liabilities when cash payments are received or due in advance of our performance 

we do not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for contracts with an original expected length of one year or less our payment terms vary by the type and location of our customer and the products and services offered the term between invoicing and when payment is due is not significant 

reagent rental agreements are a diagnostic industry sales method that provides use of an instrument and consumables reagents to a customer on a per test basis these agreements may also include maintenance of the instruments placed at customer locations as well as initial training we initially determine if a reagent rental arrangement contains a lease at lease commencement where we have determined that such an arrangement contains a lease we next must ascertain its lease classification for purposes of applying appropriate accounting treatment as an operating salestype or direct financing lease for purposes of determining the lease term used in performing the lease classification test we include the noncancellable period of the lease together with those periods covered by the option to extend the lease if the customer is reasonably certain to exercise that option the periods covered by an option to terminate the lease if the customer is reasonably certain not to exercise that option and the periods covered by the option to extend or not to terminate the lease in which exercise of the option is controlled by the company while most of our reagent rental arrangements contain either the option for a lessee to extend andor cancel the period in which the contract is enforceable is a very short period and therefore the lease term has been limited to the noncancellable period generally these arrangements do not contain an option for the lessee to purchase the underlying asset 

valuation of inventories 

we value inventory at the lower of the actual cost to purchase andor manufacture the inventory or the current estimated net realizable value of the inventory we review inventory quantities on hand and reduce the cost basis of excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on an estimated forecast of product demand production requirements and the quality efficacy and potency of raw materials this review is done at the end of each fiscal quarter in addition our industry is characterized by technological change frequent new product development and product obsolescence that could result in an increase in the amount of obsolete inventory quantities on hand our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate and if too high we may have overstated the carrying value of our inventory in the future if inventory is determined to be overvalued we would be required to write down the value of inventory to market and recognize such costs in our cost of goods sold at the time of such determination therefore although we make efforts to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand and perform procedures to safeguard overall inventory quality any significant unanticipated changes in demand technological developments regulations storage conditions or other economic or environmental factors affecting biological materials could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and reported results of operations 

results of operations  sales gross margins and expenses  incorporating by reference the results of operations  sales gross margins and expenses from our annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ended december 31 2019 

the following shows cost of goods sold gross profit expense items and net income as a percentage of net sales 



net sales 

n et sales sales for the year ended december 31 2020 were 255 billion compared to 231 billion for the year ended december 31 2019 an increase of 101 excluding the impact of foreign currency for the year ended december 31 2020 sales increased by approximately 103 compared to the year ended december 31 2019 currency neutral sales were led by growth in asia pacific and europe 

the life science segment sales for the year ended december 31 2020 were 123 billion an increase of 390 compared to the year ended december 31 2019 on a currency neutral basis sales increased 386 compared to the year ended december 31 2019 the currency neutral sales increase was primarily driven by growth in our gene expression droplet digital pcr  and process media product lines all regions reported double digit increases in currency neutral sales sales for the year ended december 31 2020 benefited from product lines used in the diagnosis of covid19 the carryover related to the december 2019 cyberattack and a 32 million damages award related to an intellectual property litigation that pertained to sales of infringing products that occurred during fiscal years 2015 to 2018 sales were impacted negatively in other product lines due to lab closures and reduced capacity resulting from the covid19 pandemic 

the clinical diagnostics segment sales for the year ended december 31 2020 were 131 billion a decrease of 76 compared to the year ended december 31 2019 on a currency neutral basis sales decreased 71 compared to the year ended december 31 2019 all regions reported a currency neutral sales decline sales decreased across all product lines with the exception of quality controls sales for the year ended december 31 2020 benefited from the carryover related to the december 2019 cyberattack but were impacted negatively due to the effect of covid19 on our customers’ operations 

gross margin 

consolidated gross margins were 565 for the year ended december 31 2020 compared to 544 for the year ended december 31 2019 life science segment gross margins for the year ended december 31 2020 increased by approximately 31 percentage points compared to the year ended december 31 2019 primarily due to higher sales favorable product mix and lower production costs partially offset by the 74 million cost of sales benefit in the first quarter of 2019 from an escrow release related to an acquisition from 2011 and increased customs duty recognized during the year ended december 31 2020 relating to products shipped primarily in prior years clinical diagnostics segment gross margins for the year ended december 31 2020 decreased slightly by approximately 01 percentage points compared to the year ended december 31 2019 the lower sales for the year ended december 31 2020 were primarily offset by lower service and support activity as a result of covid19 and favorable product mix 

selling general and administrative expense 

consolidated selling general and administrative expenses sga decreased to 8003 million or 314 of sales for the year ended december 31 2020 compared to 8246 million or 357 of sales for the year ended december 31 2019 decreases in sga were primarily related to lower travel costs marketing and communication expenses of 35 million mostly due to the impact of covid19 partially offset by higher employee costs and thirdparty professional services costs 

research and development expense 

research and development rd expense increased to 2266 million or 89 of sales for the year ended december 31 2020 compared to 2027 million or 88 of sales for the year ended december 31 2019 life science segment rd expense increased for the year ended december 31 2020 compared to the year ended december 31 2019 primarily driven by increased spending to accelerate innovation in key investment areas as well as expenses related to the newly acquired celsee business clinical diagnostics segment rd decreased for the year ended december 31 2020 from the year ended december 31 2019 primarily due to lower spending as a result of covid19 restrictions and lower headcount related to restructuring programs 

results of operations – nonoperating 

interest expense 

interest expense for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 was 219 million and 234 million respectively 

foreign currency exchange gains and losses 

foreign currency exchange gains and losses consist primarily of foreign currency transaction gains and losses on intercompany net receivables and payables and the change in fair value of our forward foreign exchange contracts used to manage our foreign currency exchange risk net foreign currency exchange losses for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 were 18 million and 22 million respectively the net foreign currency exchange losses were attributable to market volatility the result of the estimating process inherent in the timing of shipments and payments of intercompany debt and the cost of hedging all years are affected by the economic hedging program we employ to hedge our intercompany receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies 

change in fair market value of equity securities 

change in fair market value of equity securities were gains of 450 billion for the year ended december 31 2020 compared to 203 billion for the year ended december 31 2019 primarily resulting from the recognition of holding gains on our position in sartorius ag 

other income net 

other income net includes investment and dividend income interest income on our cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and longterm marketable securities other income net for the year ended december 31 2020 decreased to 245 million compared to 261 million for the year ended december 31 2019 other income net decreased primarily due to lower investment income of 60 million and lower sartorius ag dividend income of 68 million partially offset by the gain on the sale of the informatics division of 117 million for the year ended december 31 2020 

effective tax rate 

our effective tax rates were 224 and 222 for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively the effective tax rates for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 were driven by the unrealized gain in equity securities that is taxed at approximately 22 as well as the geographic mix of earnings and the taxation of our foreign earnings our effective tax rate may be impacted in the future either favorably or unfavorably by many factors including but not limited to changes in the geographic mix of earnings changes to statutory tax rates changes in tax laws or regulations tax audits and settlements and generation of tax credits 

our income tax returns are routinely audited by us federal state and foreign tax authorities we are currently under examination by many of these tax authorities there are differing interpretations of tax laws and regulations and as a result significant disputes may arise with these tax authorities involving issues of the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions we do not believe any currently pending uncertain tax positions will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements although an adverse resolution of one or more of these uncertain tax positions in any period may have a material impact on the results of operations for that period 

we record liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions we do not believe the resolution of our uncertain tax positions will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements although an adverse resolution of one or more of these uncertain tax positions in any period may have a material impact on the results of operations for that period 

as of december 31 2020 based on the expected outcome of certain examinations or as a result of the expiration of statutes of limitation for certain jurisdictions we believe that within the next twelve months it is reasonably possible that our previously unrecognized tax benefits could decrease by approximately 172 million substantially all such amounts will impact our effective income tax rate 

comparison of the year ended december 31 2019 to the year ended december 31 2018 

refer to item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations located in our annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ended december 31 2019 filed on march 2 2020 for the discussion of the comparison of the fiscal year ended december 31 2019 to the fiscal year ended december 31 2018 the earliest of the three fiscal years presented in the consolidated statements of operations 

liquidity and capital resources 

biorad operates and conducts business globally primarily through subsidiary companies established in the markets in which we trade goods are manufactured in a small number of locations and are then shipped to local distribution facilities around the world our product mix is diversified and certain products compete largely on product efficacy while others compete on price gross margins are generally sufficient to exceed normal operating costs and funding for research and development of new products as well as routine outflows for capital expenditures interest and taxes in addition to the annual positive cash flow from operating activities additional liquidity is readily available via the sale of shortterm investments and access to our 2000 million unsecured revolving credit facility credit agreement that we entered into in april 2019 and to a lesser extent international lines of credit borrowings under the credit agreement are available on a revolving basis and can be used to make permitted acquisitions for working capital and for other general corporate purposes we had no outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement as of december 31 2020 however 02 million was utilized for domestic standby letters of credit that reduced our borrowing availability management believes that this availability together with cash flow from operations will be adequate to meet our current objectives for operations research and development capital additions for manufacturing and distribution plant and equipment information technology systems and acquisitions of reasonable proportion to our existing total available capital in december 2020 we paid in full the 4250 million principal amount of senior notes including accrued interest 

because the company might be deemed an investment company under the investment company act based on the market value of our position in sartorius ag the company may not be able to access the capital markets or otherwise obtain additional financing until it is determined that the company is not an investment company the inability to obtain additional financing may have a negative impact on the companys ability to make acquisitions or other nonroutine investments 

at december 31 2020 we had available 9911 million in cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments of which approximately 37 was held in our foreign subsidiaries we believe that our holdings of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments in the us and in our foreign subsidiaries are sufficient to meet both the current and longterm needs of our global operations the amount of funds held in the united states can fluctuate due to the timing of receipts and payments in the ordinary course of business and due to other reasons such as acquisitions as part of our ongoing liquidity assessments we regularly monitor the mix of domestic and foreign cash flows both inflows and outflows 

it is generally our intention to repatriate certain foreign earnings to the extent that such repatriations are not restricted by local laws or accounting rules and there are no substantial incremental costs 

demand for our products and services could change more dramatically in the shortterm than in previous years due to the impacts of the covid19 pandemic as well as due to funding reimbursement constraints and support levels from government universities hospitals and private industry including diagnostic laboratories the need for certain sovereign nations with large annual deficits to curtail spending international trade disputes and increased regulation could lead to slower growth of or even a decline in our business sovereign nations either delaying payment for goods and services or renegotiating their debts could impact our liquidity 

cash flows from operations 

net cash provided by operations was 5753 million and 4579 million for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively the net increase between the year ended december 31 2020 and the year ended december 31 2019 of 1174 million was primarily due to higher cash received from customers as a result of the growth in sales for product lines used for covid19 these increases were partially offset by higher cash paid to suppliers primarily for supplies associated with covid19 products and cash paid for employee related expenses such as salaries and benefits and to a lesser extent for employee restructuring programs the decrease also consisted of higher income taxes paid and lower investment income 

cash flows from operations during the first quarter have historically had larger payments for royalties fourth quarter sales commissions to third parties and annual employee bonuses and we expect this pattern to recur in the first quarter of 2021 

cash flows from investing activities 

our investing activities have consisted primarily of cash used for acquisitions capital expenditures and activity related to the purchases sales and maturities of marketable securities 

net cash used in investing activities was 603 million and 2089 million for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively the decrease of 1486 million was primarily attributable to a 1595 million increase in net proceeds from maturities sales and purchases of marketable securities and proceeds from a divestiture of 122 million partially offset by a 173 million increase in payments for acquisitions 

cash flows from financing activities 

  

our financing activities have consisted primarily of cash used for purchases of treasury stock taxes paid on the vesting of restricted stock units and proceeds from the issuance of common stock for sharebased compensation 

net cash used in financing activities was 5230 million compared to 228 million for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively this increase was primarily attributable to the repayment of the 425 million principal amount of senior notes and 720 million to purchase treasury stock 

treasury shares 

during the year ended december 31 2020 117423 shares of class a treasury stock with an aggregate total cost of 385 million were reissued to fulfill grants to employees under our restricted stock program upon reissuing the class a treasury stock a loss of 90 million was incurred as they were reissued at a lower price than their average cost which reduced retained earnings while 295 million reduced additional paidin capital 

during the year ended december 31 2019 117993 shares of class a treasury stock with an aggregate total cost of 332 million were reissued to fulfill grants to employees under our restricted stock program upon reissuing the class a treasury stock a loss of 84 million was incurred as they were reissued at a lower price than their average cost which reduced retained earnings while 249 million reduced additional paidin capital 

the reissuance of the treasury stock for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 did not require cash payments or receipts and therefore did not affect liquidity 

during the year ended december 31 2020 we repurchased 291941 shares of class a common stock for 1000 million under our repurchase program compared to the repurchase of 88486 shares of our common stock for 280 million during the year ended december 31 2019 we designated these repurchased shares as treasury stock 

during the year ended december 31 2019 19755 shares of class a treasury stock with an aggregate total cost of 54 million were reissued to fulfill our employee stock purchase plan purchases a loss of 16 million was incurred upon reissuing the class a treasury stock as they were reissued at a lower price than their average cost which reduced retained earnings and resulted in net proceeds of 38 million 

in november 2017 the board of directors authorized a new share repurchase program granting biorad authority to repurchase on a discretionary basis up to 2500 million of outstanding shares of our common stock “share repurchase program” in july 2020 the board of directors authorized increasing the share repurchase program to allow the company to repurchase up to an additional 2000 million of stock as of december 31 2020 2731 million remained under the share repurchase program 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements that have had or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

contractual obligations 

the following summarizes certain of our contractual obligations as of december 31 2020 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our cash flows in future periods in millions

see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for recent accounting pronouncements adopted and to be adopted 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

financial risk management 

the main goal of biorad’s financial risk management program is to reduce the variance in expected cash flows arising from unexpected foreign exchange rate and interest rate changes financial exposures are managed through operational means and by using various financial instruments including cash and liquid resources borrowings and forward and spot foreign exchange contracts no derivative financial instruments are entered into for the purpose of trading or speculation company policy requires that all derivative positions are undertaken to manage the risks arising from underlying business activities these derivative transactions do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment derivative instruments used in these transactions are valued at fair value and changes in fair value are included in reported earnings 

foreign exchange risk we operate and conduct business in many countries and are exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates we face transactional currency exposures that arise when we enter into transactions denominated in currencies other than us dollars additionally our consolidated net equity is impacted by the conversion of the net assets of our international subsidiaries for which the functional currency is not the us dollar 

foreign currency exposures are managed on a centralized basis this allows for the netting of natural offsets and lowers transaction costs and net exposures where possible we seek to manage our foreign exchange risk in part through operational means including matching samecurrency revenues to samecurrency costs and samecurrency assets to samecurrency liabilities moreover weakening in one currency can often be offset by strengthening in another currency foreign exchange risk is also managed through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts positions are primarily in euro swiss franc japanese yen chinese yuan and british sterling the majority of forward contracts are for periods of 90 days or less we record the change in value of our foreign currency receivables and payables as a foreign exchange gain loss on our consolidated statements of income along with the change in fair market value of the forward exchange contract used as an economic hedge of those assets or liabilities 

our forward contract holdings at yearend were analyzed to determine their sensitivity to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates all other variables were held constant market risk associated with derivative holdings is the potential change in fair value of derivative positions arising from an adverse movement in foreign exchange rates a decline of 10 on quoted foreign exchange rates would result in an approximate netpresentvalue loss of 18 million on our derivative position as of december 31 2020 this impact of a change in exchange rates excludes the offset derived from the change in value of the underlying assets and liabilities which could reduce the adverse effect significantly 

interest rate risk of debt instruments biorad centrally manages the shortterm cash surpluses and shortfalls of its subsidiaries our holdings of variable rate debt instruments at yearend were analyzed to determine their sensitivity to movements in interest rates due to the relatively small amount of shortterm variable rate debt instruments we have outstanding there would not be a material impact to earnings or cash flows if interest rates moved adversely by 10 our holdings of longterm debt instruments consist primarily of fixedrate instruments and are thus insulated from interest rate changes as of december 31 2020 the overall interest rate risk associated with our debt instruments was not significant 




 item 9 changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure 

not applicable 




 i tem 9a controls and procedures 

a evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

we maintain “disclosure controls and procedures” as such term is defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended “exchange act” that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in securities and exchange commission rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer ceo and chief financial officer cfo as appropriate to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure in designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures management recognized that disclosure controls and procedures no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met additionally in designing disclosure controls and procedures our management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the costbenefit relationship of possible disclosure controls and procedures the design of any disclosure controls and procedures also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions 

subject to the limitations noted above our management with the participation of our ceo and cfo has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the year covered by this annual report on form 10k based on that evaluation our ceo and cfo concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to meet the objective for which they were designed and operate at the reasonable assurance level

 item 1 business 

tableend

general 

founded in 1952 and incorporated in 1957 biorad laboratories inc referred to in this report as “biorad” “we” “us” and “our” was initially engaged in the development and production of specialty chemicals used in biochemical pharmaceutical and other life science research applications we entered the field of clinical diagnostics with the development of our first test kit based on separation techniques and materials developed for life science research through internal research and development efforts and acquisitions we have expanded into various markets today biorad manufactures and supplies the life science research healthcare analytical chemistry and other markets with a broad range of products and systems used to separate complex chemical and biological materials and to identify analyze and purify their components 

as we broadened our product lines we also expanded our geographical market we have direct distribution channels in over 35 countries outside the united states through subsidiaries whose focus is sales customer service and product distribution in some locations outside and inside these 35 countries sales efforts are supplemented by distributors and agents 

description of business 

business segments 

today biorad operates in two industry segments designated as life science and clinical diagnostics both segments operate worldwide our life science segment and our clinical diagnostics segment generated 38 and 61  respectively of our net sales for the year ended december 31 2019  we generated approximately 39 of our consolidated net sales for the year ended december 31 2019 from us sales and approximately 61 from sales in our remaining worldwide markets 

for a description of business and financial information on industry and geographic segments see note 14 of item 8 of part ii of this report 

life science segment 

our life science segment is at the forefront of discovery creating advanced tools to answer complex biological questions we are a leader in the life sciences market and develop manufacture and market approximately 6000 reagents apparatus and laboratory instruments that serve a global customer base many of our products are used in established research techniques biopharmaceutical production processes and food testing regimes these techniques are typically used to separate purify and identify biological materials such as proteins nucleic acids and bacteria within a laboratory or production setting we focus on selected segments of the life sciences market in proteomics the study of proteins genomics the study of genes biopharmaceutical production cellular biology and food safety we estimate that the worldwide market that our portfolios can address for products in these selected segments of our addressable markets is approximately 9 billion our principal life science customers include universities and medical schools industrial research organizations government agencies pharmaceutical manufacturers biotechnology researchers food producers and food testing laboratories 

clinical diagnostics segment 

our clinical diagnostics segment designs manufactures sells and supports test systems informatics systems test kits and specialized quality controls that serve clinical laboratories in the global diagnostics market our products currently address specific niches within the in vitro diagnostics ivd test market and we seek to focus on the higher margin higher growth segments of this market 

we supply more than 3000 different products that cover more than 300 clinical diagnostic tests to the ivd test market we estimate that the worldwide sales for products in the markets we serve were approximately 12 billion ivd tests are conducted outside the human body and are used to identify and measure substances in a patient’s tissue blood or urine our products consist of reagents instruments and software typically provided to our customers as an integrated package to allow them to generate reproducible test results revenue in this business is highly recurring as laboratories typically standardize test methodologies which are dependent on a particular supplier’s equipment reagents and consumable products an installed base of diagnostic test systems therefore typically creates an ongoing source of revenue through the sale of test kits for each sample analyzed on an installed system our principal clinical diagnostic customers include hospital laboratories reference laboratories transfusion laboratories and physician office laboratories 

raw materials and components 

we utilize a wide variety of chemicals biological materials electronic components machined metal parts optical parts computing and peripheral devices most of these materials and components are available from numerous sources and generally we have not experienced difficulty in securing adequate supplies however in certain instances we acquire components and materials from a sole supplier due to the regulatory environment in which we operate we may be unable to quickly establish additional or replacement sources for some components or materials 

patents trademarks and licenses 

we own over 2000 us and international patents and numerous trademarks we also hold licenses under us and foreign patents owned by third parties and pay royalties on the sales of certain products under the licenses we view these patents trademarks and license agreements as valuable assets however we believe that our ability to develop and manufacture our products depends primarily on our knowledge technology and special skills rather than our patent trademark and licensing positions 

seasonal operations and backlog 

our business is not inherently seasonal however the european custom of concentrating vacation during the summer months usually tempers third quarter sales volume and operating income 

for the most part we operate in markets characterized by short lead times and the absence of significant backlogs management has concluded that backlog information is not material to our business as a whole 

sales and marketing 

we conduct our worldwide operations through an extensive direct sales force employing approximately 920 direct sales and sales management personnel around the world our sales force typically consists of experienced industry professionals with scientific training and we maintain a separate specialist sales force for each of our segments we believe that this direct sales approach allows us to sell a broader range of our products that creates more brand awareness and longterm relationships with our customers 

we also use a range of sales and marketing intermediaries smis in our international markets the types of smis we utilize are distributors agents brokers and resellers we have programs and policies in place with our smis that require compliance with all applicable laws including adhering to our anticorruption standards to ensure a transparent sale to our customers 

our customer base is broad and diversified our worldwide customer base includes 1 prominent university and research institutions 2 hospital public health and commercial laboratories 3 other leading diagnostic manufacturers and 4 leading companies in the biotechnology pharmaceutical chemical and food industries there has been no single customer that accounted for more than three percent of our total net sales our sales are affected by a number of external factors for example a number of our customers particularly in the life science segment are substantially dependent on government grants and research contracts for their funding 

most of our international sales are generated by our whollyowned international subsidiaries and their branch offices certain of these subsidiaries also have manufacturing facilities biorad’s international operations are subject to certain risks common to foreign operations in general such as changes in governmental regulations import restrictions and foreign exchange fluctuations 

competition 

the markets served by our product groups are highly competitive our competitors range in size from startups to large multinational corporations with significant resources and reach we seek to compete primarily in market segments where our products and technology offer customers specific advantages over the competition 

because of the breadth of its product lines our life science segment does not face the same competitors for all of its products major competitors in this market include becton dickinson ge biosciences merck millipore and thermo fisher scientific we compete primarily based on meeting performance specifications and offering complete solutions 

major competitors of our clinical diagnostics segment include roche abbott laboratories siemens danaher thermo fisher becton dickinson biomérieux ortho clinical diagnostics tosoh immucor and diasorin we compete in our customer segments by providing high quality products broad product portfolios and outstanding customer support 

research and development 

we conduct extensive research and development activities in all areas of our business employing approximately 780 employees worldwide in these activities including degreed scientists and technical support staff research and development has played a major role in biorad’s growth and is expected to continue to do so in the future our research teams are continuously developing new products and new applications for existing products in our development of new products and applications we interact with scientific and medical professionals at universities hospitals and medical schools and within our industry 

regulatory matters 

the development testing manufacturing marketing postmarket surveillance distribution advertising and labeling of certain of our products primarily diagnostic products are subject to regulation in the united states by the center for devices and radiological health of the us food and drug administration fda and in other jurisdictions by state and foreign government authorities fda regulations require that some new products have premarketing clearance or approval by the fda and require certain products to be manufactured in accordance with fda’s “good manufacturing practice” regulations to be extensively tested and to be properly labeled to disclose test results and performance claims and limitations after a product that is subject to fda regulation is placed on the market numerous regulatory requirements apply including for example the requirement that we comply with recordkeeping and reporting requirements such as the fda’s medical device reporting regulations and reporting of corrections and removals the fda enforces these requirements by inspection and market surveillance the fda has authority to take various administrative and legal actions against us for our or our products’ failure to comply with relevant legal or regulatory requirements including issuing warning letters initiating product seizures requesting or requiring product recalls or withdrawals and other civil or criminal sanctions among other things 

we are also subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business such laws include without limitation state and federal antikickback fraud and abuse false claims privacy and security and physician sunshine laws and regulations if our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to us we may be subject to penalties including without limitation civil and criminal penalties damages fines the curtailment or restructuring of our operations exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment 

sales of our products will depend in part on the extent to which our products or diagnostic tests using our products will be covered by thirdparty payors such as government health care programs commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations these thirdparty payors are increasingly reducing reimbursements for certain medical products and services in addition the us government state legislatures and foreign governments have continued implementing cost containment programs including price controls and restrictions on reimbursement adoption of price controls and costcontainment measures and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures could further limit our net revenue and results decreases in thirdparty reimbursement for our products or diagnostic tests using our products or a decision by a thirdparty payor to not cover our products could reduce or eliminate utilization of our products and have a material adverse effect on our sales results of operations and financial condition in addition healthcare reform measures have been and will be adopted in the future any of which could limit the amounts that governments will pay for healthcare products and services which could result in reduced demand for our products or additional pricing pressures 

as a multinational manufacturer and distributor of sophisticated instrumentation we must meet a wide array of electromagnetic compatibility and safety compliance requirements to satisfy regulations in the united states the european union and other jurisdictions 

our operations are subject to federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations that govern such activities as transportation of goods emissions to air and discharges to water as well as handling and disposal practices for solid hazardous and medical wastes in addition to environmental laws that regulate our operations we are also subject to environmental laws and regulations that create liabilities and cleanup responsibility for spills disposals or other releases of hazardous substances into the environment as a result of our operations or otherwise impacting real property that we own or operate the environmental laws and regulations could also subject us to claims by third parties for damages resulting from any spills disposals or releases resulting from our operations or at any of our properties 

these regulatory requirements vary widely among countries 

employees 

at december 31 2019  biorad had approximately 8120 employees approximately seven percent of our approximately 3180 us employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement which will expire on november 14 2023 many of our nonus fulltime employees especially in france are covered by collective bargaining agreements we consider our employee relations to be generally good

 item 1a risk factors 

in evaluating our business and whether to invest in any of our securities you should carefully read the following risk factors in addition to the other information contained in this annual report we believe that any of the following risks could have a material effect on our business results of operations or financial condition our industry or the trading price of our common stock we operate in a continually changing business environment and new risks and uncertainties emerge from time to time we cannot predict these new risks and uncertainties nor can we assess the extent to which any such new risks and uncertainties or the extent to which the risks and uncertainties set forth below may adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition our industry or the trading price of our common stock 

our international operations expose us to additional costs and legal and regulatory risks which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we have significant international operations we have direct distribution channels in over 35 countries outside the united states and in 2019 our foreign entities generated 61 of our net sales compliance with complex foreign and us laws and regulations that apply to our international operations increases our cost of doing business these numerous and sometimes conflicting laws and regulations include among others data privacy requirements including the requirements for compliance with the eu general data protection regulation which went into effect may 25 2018 labor relations laws tax laws anticompetition regulations import and trade restrictions tariffs duties quotas and other trade barriers export requirements us laws such as the foreign corrupt practices act and other us federal laws and regulations established by the office of foreign asset control foreign laws such as the uk bribery act 2010 or other foreign laws which prohibit corrupt payments to governmental officials or certain payments or remunerations to customers in addition changes in laws or regulations potentially could be disruptive to our operations and business relationships in the affected regions for example the united kingdoms withdrawal from the european union commonly referred to as “brexit” could disrupt the free movement of goods services and people between the united kingdom and the european union and result in increased regulatory legal labor and tax complexities 

given the high level of complexity of the foreign and us laws and regulations that apply to our international operations there is a risk that we may inadvertently breach some provisions for example through fraudulent or negligent behavior of individual employees our failure to comply with certain formal documentation requirements or otherwise our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate these risks and manage these challenges through policies procedures and internal controls however we have a dispersed international sales organization and we use distributors and agents in many of our international operations this structure makes it more difficult for us to ensure that our international selling operations comply with laws and regulations and our global policies and procedures 

violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines criminal sanctions against us our officers or our employees requirements to obtain export licenses cessation of business activities in sanctioned countries implementation of compliance programs and prohibitions on the conduct of our business violations of laws and regulations also could result in prohibitions on our ability to offer our products in one or more countries and could materially damage our reputation our brand our international expansion efforts our ability to attract and retain employees or our business results of operations and financial condition see also our risk factors regarding government regulations and regarding global economic conditions below 

the industries and market segments in which we operate are highly competitive and we may not be able to compete effectively 

the life science and clinical diagnostics markets are each highly competitive some of our competitors have merged and some of our competitors have greater financial resources than we do making them better equipped to license technologies and intellectual property from third parties or to fund research and development manufacturing and marketing efforts moreover competitive and regulatory conditions in many markets in which we operate restrict our ability to fully recover through price increases higher costs of acquired goods and services resulting from inflation and other drivers of cost increases many public tenders have become more competitive due to governments lengthening the commitments of their public tenders to multiple years which reduce the number of tenders in which we can participate annually because the value of these multipleyear tenders is so high our competitors have been more aggressive with their pricing our failure to compete effectively andor pricing pressures resulting from competition could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

we may not be able to grow our business because of our failure to develop new or improved products 

our future growth depends in part on our ability to continue to improve our product offerings and develop and introduce new product lines and extensions that integrate technological advances in particular we may not be able to keep up with changes in the clinical diagnostics industry such as the trend toward molecular diagnostics or pointofcare tests if we are unable to integrate technological advances into our product offerings or to design develop manufacture and market new product lines and extensions successfully and in a timely manner our business results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected we have experienced product launch delays in the past and may do so in the future we cannot assure you that our product and process development efforts will be successful or that new products we introduce will achieve market acceptance failure to launch successful new products or improvements to existing products may cause our products to become obsolete which could harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

breaches of our information systems could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

we have experienced and expect to continue to experience attempts by computer programmers and hackers to attack and penetrate our layered security controls like the december 2019 cyberattack that is further discussed in item 7 of this annual report through our sales and ecommerce channels we collect and store confidential information that customers provide to among other things purchase products or services enroll in promotional programs and register on our web site we also acquire and retain information about suppliers and employees in the normal course of business such information on our systems includes personally identifiable information and in limited instances protected health information we also create and maintain proprietary information that is critical to our business such as our product designs and manufacturing processes despite recent initiatives to improve our technology systems such as our enterprise resource planning implementation and the centralization of our global information technology organization we could experience a significant data security breach because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target we may not be able to anticipate all of these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures computer hackers have attempted to penetrate and will likely continue to attempt to penetrate our and our vendors’ information systems and if successful could misappropriate confidential customer supplier employee or other business information such as our intellectual property third parties could also gain control of our systems and use them for criminal purposes while appearing to be us as a result we could lose existing customers have difficulty attracting new customers be exposed to claims from customers financial institutions payment card associations employees and other persons have regulatory sanctions or penalties imposed incur additional expenses or lose revenues as a result of a data privacy breach or suffer other adverse consequences our operations and ability to process sales orders particularly through our ecommerce channels could also be disrupted as they were in the december 2019 cyberattack any significant breakdown intrusion interruption corruption or destruction of our systems as well as any data breaches could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations see also our risk factors regarding our information technology systems and our enterprise resource planning system erp implementation below 

if our information technology systems are disrupted or if we fail to successfully implement manage and integrate our information technology and reporting systems our business results of operations and financial condition could be harmed 

our information technology it systems are an integral part of our business and a serious disruption of our it systems could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition we depend on our it systems to process orders manage inventory and collect accounts receivable our it systems also allow us to efficiently purchase products from our suppliers and ship products to our customers on a timely basis maintain costeffective operations and provide customer service we may experience disruption of our it systems due to redundancy issues with our network servers we cannot assure you that our contingency plans will allow us to operate at our current level of efficiency 

our ability to implement our business plan in a rapidly evolving market requires effective planning reporting and analytical processes we expect that we will need to continue to improve and further integrate our it systems reporting systems and operating procedures by training and educating our employees with respect to these improvements and integrations on an ongoing basis in order to effectively run our business we may suffer interruptions in service loss of data or reduced functionality when we upgrade or change systems if we fail to successfully manage and integrate our it systems reporting systems and operating procedures it could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition see also our risk factors regarding our data security above and erp implementation and events beyond our control below 

we are subject to foreign currency exchange fluctuations which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

as stated above a significant portion of our operations and sales are outside of the united states when we make purchases and sales in currencies other than the us dollars we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar that may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition our international sales are largely denominated in local currencies as a result the strengthening of the us dollar negatively impacts our consolidated net sales expressed in us dollars conversely when the us dollar weakens our expenses at our international sites increase in addition the volatility of other currencies may negatively impact our operations outside of the united states and increase our costs to hedge against currency fluctuations we cannot assure you that future shifts in currency exchange rates will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

our reported financial results may be materially affected by changes in the market value of our investment in sartorius ag 

changes in the market value of our investment in sartorius ag may continue to materially impact our consolidated statements of income and other financial statements a decline in the market value of our investment in sartorius ag could result in significant losses due to writedowns in the value of the equity securities an increase in the market value of our investment in sartorius ag could result in a significant and favorable impact to net income independent of the actual operating performance of our business for example our net income for 2019 was significantly and favorably impacted by recognition on the income statement of an increase in the fair market value of equity securities of 20310 million  primarily related to the holdings of our investment in sartorius ag net income for 2018 was also significantly and favorably impacted by recognition on the income statement of an increase in the fair market value of equity securities of 6062 million  primarily related to the holdings of our investment in sartorius ag 

our share price may change significantly based upon changes in the market valuation of sartorius ag and such change may be unrelated to the actual performance of our business nonoperating income for a period may be significantly impacted by the timing of dividends paid by sartorius ag particularly in comparison to prior year periods 

we may incur losses in future periods due to writedowns in the value of financial instruments 

we have positions in a variety of financial instruments including asset backed securities and other similar instruments financial markets are volatile and the markets for these securities can be illiquid the value of these securities will continue to be impacted by external market factors including default rates changes in the value of the underlying property such as residential or commercial real estate rating agency actions the prices at which observable market transactions occur and the financial strength of various entities such as financial guarantors who provide insurance for the securities should we need to convert these positions to cash we may not be able to sell these instruments without significant losses due to current debtor financial conditions or other market considerations 

we also have positions in equity securities including our investment in sartorius ag financial markets are volatile and the markets for these equity securities can be illiquid as well a decline in the market value of our investments in equity securities that we own could result in significant losses due to writedowns in the value of the equity securities in addition if we need to convert these positions to cash we may not be able to sell these equity securities without significant losses 

we may experience difficulties implementing our new global enterprise resource planning system 

we are engaged in a multiyear implementation of a new global enterprise resource planning system erp the erp is designed to efficiently maintain our books and records and provide information important to the operation of our business to our management team the erp will continue to require significant investment of human and financial resources in implementing the erp we may experience significant delays increased costs and other difficulties any significant disruption or deficiency in the design and implementation of the erp could adversely affect our ability to process orders ship product send invoices and track payments fulfill contractual obligations or otherwise operate our business for example we experienced system implementation issues in our clinical diagnostics segment during our first deployment that impacted invoicing and caused an increase in accounts receivable in our second deployment we experienced delays in manufacturing and logistics which adversely impacted our sales in our third deployment in western europe in april 2017 we experienced system implementation issues impacting the timing of payment of vendor invoices and resulting in delays in product availability and shipments we also experienced lower productivity levels related to the april 2017 golive of the erp in western europe which adversely impacted our sales during the second and third quarters of 2017 we expect to implement the remaining smaller phases of the erp platform over the next few years in addition our efforts to centralize various business processes and functions within our organization in connection with our erp implementation may continue to disrupt our operations and negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition 

recent and planned changes to our organizational structure and executive management team could negatively impact our business 

we made significant changes to our organizational structure over the past few years in 2016 we began implementing the reorganization of the structure of our european organization and we have continued implementing this reorganization in 2017 2018 and 2019 the board of directors appointed a new chief financial officer effective april 6 2019 and a new chief operating officer effective april 22 2019 at the beginning of 2020 we appointed a new executive to head our clinical diagnostics segment and we restructured this segment based on functional groups rather than product line divisions these changes may have unintended consequences such as distraction of our management and employees business disruption attrition of our workforce inability to attract or retain key employees and reduced employee morale or productivity 

violations of the us foreign corrupt practices act or similar anticorruption laws could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

as further discussed above in our risk factor concerning our international operations we have significant international operations which expose us to additional costs and legal and regulatory risks including the risk of violating anticorruption laws such as the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa or similar anticorruption laws as previously disclosed we entered into a nonprosecution agreement npa with the us department of justice doj and the securities and exchange commission sec and consented to the entry of an order by the sec sec order effective november 3 2014 which actions resolved both the doj and the sec investigations into our violations of the fcpa any future violations of the fcpa could result in more punitive actions by the sec and doj andor could harm our reputation with customers either of which could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

our failure to establish and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could result in material misstatements in our financial statements our failure to meet our reporting obligations and cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information which in turn could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline 

maintaining effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting are necessary for us to produce reliable financial statements 

as previously discussed in item 9a controls and procedures of our annual report for the period ended december 31 2017 and item 4 controls and procedures of our 2018 form 10qs management identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2017 and throughout 2018 management conducted an extensive remediation plan to address its material weakness and management concluded that the material weakness had been remediated as of december 31 2018 however we cannot assure you that additional deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting will not be identified in the future 

material weaknesses have adversely affected us in the past and could affect us in the future and the results of our periodic management evaluations and annual auditor attestation reports regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting required by section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 any failure to maintain or implement new or improved internal controls or any difficulties that we may encounter in their maintenance or implementation could result in additional significant deficiencies or material weaknesses result in material misstatements in our consolidated financial statements and cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations this could cause us to lose public confidence and could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline for further information regarding our controls and procedures see part ii item 9a of this annual report on form 10k 

risks relating to intellectual property rights may negatively impact our business 

we rely on a combination of copyright trade secret patent and trademark laws and thirdparty nondisclosure agreements to protect our intellectual property rights and products however we cannot assure you that our intellectual property rights will not be challenged invalidated circumvented or rendered unenforceable or that meaningful protection or adequate remedies will be available to us for instance unauthorized third parties have attempted to copy our intellectual property reverse engineer or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary or have developed equivalent technologies independently and may do so in the future additionally third parties have asserted patent copyright and other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to us and may do so in the future if we are unable to license or otherwise access protected technology used in our products or if we lose our rights under any existing licenses we could be prohibited from manufacturing and marketing such products from time to time we also must enforce our patents or other intellectual property rights or defend ourselves against claimed infringement of the rights of others through litigation as a result we could incur substantial costs be forced to redesign our products or be required to pay damages or royalties to an infringed party any of the foregoing matters could adversely impact our business results of operations and financial condition  

global economic and geopolitical conditions could adversely affect our operations 

in recent years we have been faced with very challenging global economic conditions a deterioration in the global economic environment may result in decreased demand for our products increased competition downward pressure on the prices for our products and longer sales cycles a weakening of macroeconomic conditions may also adversely affect our suppliers which could result in interruptions in supply in the future we have also experienced delays in collecting receivables in certain countries in western europe and we may experience similar delays in these and other countries or regions experiencing liquidity problems in addition a slowing of growth in the chinese economy and in emerging markets especially those oilproducing countries that would be affected by a decline in oil prices could adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition there is also uncertainty surrounding the impact that brexit will have on european and worldwide economic conditions and the stability of global financial markets and a negative effect from any of these things could adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition additionally the united states and other countries such as china and india recently have imposed tariffs on certain goods while tariffs imposed by other countries on us goods have not yet had a significant impact on our business further escalation of tariffs or other trade barriers could adversely impact our profitability andor our competitiveness in addition the geopolitical situation in locations such as the middle east could adversely affect our business in such locations see also our risk factors regarding our international operations above and regarding government regulations below 

reductions in government funding and the capital spending programs of our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

our customers include universities clinical diagnostics laboratories government agencies hospitals and pharmaceutical biotechnology and chemical companies the capital spending programs of these institutions and companies have a significant effect on the demand for our products such programs are based on a wide variety of factors including the resources available to make such purchases the availability of funding from grants by governments or government agencies the spending priorities for various types of equipment and the policies regarding capital expenditures during industry downturns or recessionary periods if government funding to our customers were to decrease or if our customers were to decrease or reallocate their budgets in a manner adverse to us our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

changes in the healthcare industry could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

there have been and will continue to be significant changes in the healthcare industry in an effort to reduce costs these changes include 



 

to the extent that the healthcare industry seeks to address the need to contain costs stemming from reform measures such as those contained in the ppaca and the pama or in future legislation by limiting the number of clinical tests being performed or the amount of reimbursement available for such tests our business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected if these changes in the healthcare markets in the united states and europe continue we could be forced to alter our approach in selling marketing distributing and servicing our products 

we are subject to substantial government regulation and any changes in regulation or violations of regulations by us could adversely affect our business prospects results of operations or financial condition 

some of our products primarily our clinical diagnostic products production processes and marketing are subject to us federal state and local and foreign regulation including by the fda in the united states and its foreign counterparts the fda regulates our clinical diagnostic products as medical devices and we are subject to significant regulatory clearances or approvals to market our clinical diagnostic products and other requirements including for example recordkeeping and reporting requirements such as the fda’s medical device reporting regulations and reporting of corrections and removals the fda has broad regulatory and enforcement powers if the fda determines that we have failed to comply with applicable regulatory requirements it can impose a variety of enforcement actions ranging from public warning letters fines injunctions consent decrees and civil penalties to suspension or delayed issuance of approvals seizure or recall of our products total or partial shutdown of production withdrawal of approvals or clearances already granted and criminal prosecution 

the fda can also require us to repair replace or refund the cost of devices that we manufactured or distributed 

in addition the fda may change its clearance and approval policies adopt additional regulations or revise existing regulations or take other actions which may prevent or delay approval or clearance of our products or impact our ability to modify our currently approved or cleared products on a timely basis changes in the fda’s review of certain clinical diagnostic products referred to as laboratory developed tests which are tests developed by a single laboratory for use only in that laboratory could affect some of our customers who use our life science instruments for laboratory developed tests in the past the fda has chosen to not enforce applicable regulations and has not reviewed such tests for approval however the fda has issued draft guidance that it may begin enforcing its medical device requirements including premarket submission requirements to such tests any delay in or failure to receive or maintain clearance or approval for our products could prevent us from generating revenue from these products and adversely affect our business operations and financial results additionally the fda and other regulatory authorities have broad enforcement powers regulatory enforcement or inquiries or other increased scrutiny on us could affect the perceived safety and efficacy of our products and dissuade our customers from using our products 

many foreign governments have similar rules and regulations regarding the importation registration labeling sale and use of our products such agencies may also impose new requirements that may require us to modify or reregister products already on the market or otherwise impact our ability to market our products in those countries for example in april 2017 the european parliament voted to enact final regulations that include broad changes regarding in vitro diagnostic devices and medical devices which will require us to modify or reregister some products and will result in additional costs in addition russia has enacted more stringent medical product registration and labeling regulations china has enacted stricter labeling requirements and we expect other countries such as brazil and india to impose more regulations that impact our product registrations brexit also will likely result in additional regulatory requirements associated with goods sold in the united kingdom and will likely result in additional complexities and possible delays with respect to goods raw materials and personnel moving between the united kingdom and the european union in addition new government administrations may interpret existing regulations or practices differently for example the mexican health regulatory agency cofepris in 2019 cited biorad’s mexican subsidiary for operating practices that had been endorsed by a prior administration which has impacted our ability to conduct our clinical diagnostics business in mexico due to these evolving and diverse requirements we face uncertain product approval timelines additional time and effort to comply as well as the potential for reduced sales andor fines for noncompliance increasing protectionism in such countries also impedes our ability to compete with local companies for example we may not be able to participate in certain public tenders in russia because of increasing measures to restrict access to such tenders for companies without local manufacturing capabilities such regulations could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition see also our risk factors regarding our international operations and regarding global economic and geopolitical conditions above 

we are also subject to government regulation of the use and handling of a number of materials and controlled substances the us drug enforcement administration establishes registration security recordkeeping reporting storage distribution and other requirements for controlled substances pursuant to the controlled substances act of 1970 failure to comply with present or future laws and regulations could result in substantial liability to us suspension or cessation of our operations restrictions on our ability to expand at our present locations or require us to make significant capital expenditures or incur other significant expenses 

we cannot assure you that we will be able to integrate acquired companies products or technologies into our company successfully or we may not be able to realize the anticipated benefits from the acquisitions 

as part of our overall business strategy we pursue acquisitions of and investments in complementary companies products and technologies in order to be successful in these activities we must among other things 

 

the benefits of any acquisition may prove to be less than anticipated and may not outweigh the costs reported in our financial statements completing any potential future acquisitions could cause significant diversion of our management’s time and resources if we acquire new companies products or technologies we may be required to assume contingent liabilities or record impairment charges for goodwill and other intangible assets over time goodwill and nonamortizable intangible assets are subject to impairment testing and potential periodic goodwill impairment charges amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets and other writeoffs could harm our 

operating results impairment tests are highly sensitive to changes in assumptions and minor changes to assumptions could result in impairment losses if the results forecast in our impairment tests are not achieved or business trends vary from the assumptions used in forecasts or external factors change detrimentally future impairment losses may occur for example as we previously discussed in item 7 of our annual report for the period ended december 31 2017 one reporting unit whose goodwill was primarily from the acquisitions of biotest ag and diamed holding ag had excess fair value over book value of only 8 at december 31 2017 the goodwill allocated to this reporting unit as of december 31 2017 was 2636 million we impaired all the goodwill related to this reporting unit for the year ended december 31 2018 because assumptions utilized in our 2017 forecast did not materialize 

we cannot assure you that we will successfully overcome these risks or any other problems we encounter in connection with any acquisitions and any such acquisitions could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

product quality and liability issues could harm our reputation and negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition 

we must adequately address quality issues associated with our products including defects in our engineering design and manufacturing processes as well as defects in thirdparty components included in our products our instruments reagents and consumables are complex and identifying the root cause of quality issues especially those affecting reagents or thirdparty components is difficult we may incur significant costs and expend substantial time in researching and remediating such issues quality issues could also delay our launching or manufacturing of new products in addition quality issues unapproved uses of our products or inadequate disclosure of risks related to our products could result in product recalls or product liability or other claims being brought against us these issues could harm our reputation impair our relationship with existing customers and harm our ability to attract new customers which could negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition 

lack of key personnel could hurt our business 

our products are very technical in nature in general only highly qualified and welltrained scientists have the necessary skills to develop market and sell our products and many of our manufacturing positions require very specialized knowledge and skills in addition the global nature of our business also requires that we have sophisticated and experienced staff to comply with increasingly complex international laws and regulations we face intense competition for these professionals from our competitors customers marketing partners and other companies throughout our industry in particular the job market in northern california where many of our employees are located is very competitive if we do not offer competitive compensation and benefits we may fail to retain or attract a sufficient number of qualified personnel which could impair our ability to properly run our business 

in some cases we rely on temporary personnel or consultants and we may do so in the future such temporary personnel or consultants may lack the knowledge andor specific skills necessary for our business require time to train without benefiting us through extended employment and increase our costs in addition as noted above our strategic initiatives such as our internal restructuring and erp implementation may be burdensome and disruptive and lead to employee dissatisfaction and attrition also loss including retirement of longterm personnel may negatively impact our ability to conduct our business 

a reduction or interruption in the supply of components and raw materials could adversely affect our manufacturing operations and related product sales 

the manufacture of many of our products requires the timely delivery of sufficient amounts of quality components and materials we manufacture our products in numerous manufacturing facilities around the world we acquire our components and materials from many suppliers in various countries we work closely with our suppliers to ensure the continuity of supply but we cannot guarantee these efforts will always be successful further while we seek to diversify our sources of components and materials in certain instances we acquire components and materials from a sole supplier in addition due to the regulatory environment in which we operate we may be unable to quickly establish additional or replacement sources for some components or materials if our supply is reduced or interrupted or of poor quality and we are unable to develop alternative sources for such supply our ability to manufacture our products in a timely or costeffective manner could be adversely affected which would adversely affect our ability to sell our products 

natural disasters terrorist attacks acts of war or other events beyond our control may cause damage or disruption to us and our employees facilities information systems security systems vendors and customers which could significantly impact our business results of operations and financial condition 

we have significant manufacturing and distribution facilities including in the western united states france switzerland germany and singapore in particular the western united states has experienced a number of earthquakes wildfires floods landslides and other natural disasters in recent years these occurrences could damage or destroy our facilities which may result in interruptions to our business and losses that exceed our insurance coverage in addition electricity outages strikes or other labor unrest at any of our sites or surrounding areas could cause disruption to our business 

acts of terrorism bioterrorism violence or war or public health issues such as the outbreak of a contagious disease like the 2019novel coronavirus covid19 could also affect the markets in which we operate our business operations and strategic plans political unrest may affect our sales in certain regions such as in southeast asia the middle east and eastern europe any of these events could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

we may have higher than anticipated tax liabilities 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and many foreign jurisdictions we report our results of operations based on our determination of the amount of taxes owed in various tax jurisdictions in which we operate the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires estimation judgment and calculations where the ultimate tax determination may not be certain our determination of our tax liabilities is subject to review or examination by tax authorities in various tax jurisdictions tax authorities have disagreed with our judgment in the past and may disagree with positions we take in the future resulting in assessments of additional taxes any adverse outcome of such review or examination could have a negative impact on our operating results and financial condition 

economic and political pressures to increase tax revenues in various jurisdictions may make resolving tax disputes more difficult for example in recent years the tax authorities in europe have disagreed with our tax positions related to hybrid debt research and development credits transfer pricing and indirect taxes among others we regularly assess the likelihood of the outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals 

the results from various tax examinations audits and litigation may differ from the liabilities recorded in our financial statements and could materially and adversely affect our financial results and cash flows in the periods in which those determinations are made 

changes in tax laws or rates changes in the interpretation of tax laws or changes in the jurisdictional mix of our earnings could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations 

on december 22 2017 the us enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act the “tax act” which made a number of substantial changes to how the united states imposes income tax on multinational corporations the us treasury internal revenue service and other standard setting bodies continue to issue guidance and interpretation relating to the tax act as future guidance is issued we may make adjustments to amounts previously reported that could materially impact our financial statements 

our global operations subject us to income and other taxes in the us and in numerous foreign jurisdictions each with different tax schemes and tax rates in addition to the changes in tax laws and the interpretation of tax laws and tax rates in these jurisdictions the jurisdictional mix of our earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates can have a significant impact on our effective tax rate from period to period 

the tax effect of our investment in sartorius ag and the jurisdictional mix of our earnings could continue to materially affect our financial results and cash flow 

in addition the adoption of some or all of the recommendations set forth in the organization for economic cooperation and development’s project on “base erosion and profit shifting” beps by tax authorities in the countries in which we operate could negatively impact our effective tax rate these recommendations focus on payments from affiliates in high tax jurisdictions to affiliates in lower tax jurisdictions and the activities that give rise to a taxable presence in a particular country 

our reported financial results may be materially affected by changes in accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 

generally accepted accounting principles in the united states or us gaap are subject to interpretation by the financial accounting standards board or fasb the us securities and exchange commission or sec and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles a change in these principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported financial results and could affect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement of a change 

for example in january 2016 the fasb issued accounting standards update no asu 201601 recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities amendments under asu 201601 among other items require that all equity investments in unconsolidated entities other than those accounted for using the equity method of accounting such as our investment in sartorius ag will be measured at fair value through earnings the impact of adoption of asu 201601 in the first quarter of 2018 materially impacted our condensed consolidated statements of income due to our investment in sartorius ag and this impact may continue in future periods 

also for example in february 2016 the fasb issued asu 201602 leases which requires among other items lease accounting to recognize most leases as assets and liabilities on the balance sheet we adopted asu 201602 on a modified retrospective basis effective january 1 2019 with practical expedients where we act as a lessee the adoption of the standard resulted in material additions to the balance sheet for rightofuse assets and the associated liabilities where we act as a lessor in reagent rental arrangements there was an insignificant impact to our consolidated financial statements 

environmental health and safety regulations and enforcement proceedings may negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition 

our operations are subject to federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations that govern such activities as transportation of goods emissions to air and discharges to water as well as handling and disposal practices for solid hazardous and medical wastes in addition to environmental laws that regulate our operations we are also subject to environmental laws and regulations that create liability and cleanup responsibility for spills disposals or other releases of hazardous substances into the environment as a result of our operations or otherwise impacting real property that we own or operate the environmental laws and regulations also subject us to claims by third parties for damages resulting from any spills disposals or releases resulting from our operations or at any of our properties we must also comply with various health and safety regulations in the united states and abroad in connection with our operations 

we may in the future incur capital and operating costs to comply with currently existing laws and regulations and possible new statutory enactments and these expenditures may be significant we have incurred and may in the future incur fines related to environmental matters andor liability for costs or damages related to spills or other releases of hazardous substances into the environment at sites where we have operated or at offsite locations where we have sent hazardous substances for disposal we cannot assure you however that such matters or any future obligations to comply with environmental or health and safety laws and regulations will not adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

our debt may restrict our future operations 

we have substantial debt and have the ability to incur additional debt as of december 31 2019  we had approximately 4398 million of outstanding indebtedness primarily consisting of the 4875 notes due in december 2020 as further discussed in note 5 of the consolidated financial statements in addition we have a revolving credit facility that provides for up to 2000 million  02 million of which has been utilized for domestic standby letters of credit our incurrence of substantial amounts of debt may have important consequences for instance it could 

 

our existing credit facility and the terms of our other debt instruments including agreements we may enter in the future contain or will contain covenants imposing significant restrictions on our business these restrictions may affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise these covenants place restrictions on our ability to among other things incur additional debt acquire other businesses or assets through merger or purchase create liens make investments enter into transactions with affiliates sell assets in the case of some of our subsidiaries guarantee debt and declare or pay dividends redeem stock or make other distributions to stockholders our existing credit facility also requires that we comply with certain financial ratios including a maximum consolidated leverage ratio test and a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio test 

our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control including prevailing economic financial and industry conditions the breach of any of these restrictions could result in a default an event of default under our debt agreements would permit some of our lenders to declare all amounts borrowed from them to be due and payable together with accrued and unpaid interest in addition acceleration of our other indebtedness may cause us to be unable to make interest payments on our outstanding notes and repay the principal amount of our outstanding notes or may cause the future subsidiary guarantors if any to be unable to make payments under the guarantees 

we are subject to healthcare laws and regulations and could face substantial penalties if we are unable to fully comply with such laws 

we are subject to healthcare regulation and enforcement by both the us federal government and the us states and foreign governments in which we conduct our business these healthcare laws and regulations include for example 

 

 

 

 

 

these laws will continue to impose administrative cost and compliance burdens on us the shifting compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust systems to comply with multiple jurisdictions with different compliance andor reporting requirements increases the possibility that a healthcare company may violate one or more of these requirements in addition any action against us for violation of these laws even if we successfully defend against it could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business if our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us we may be subject to penalties including civil and criminal penalties damages fines exclusion from the medicare and medicaid programs and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business results of operations and financial condition 

regulations related to “conflict minerals” could adversely impact our business 

as part of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the sec adopted disclosure requirements regarding the use of certain minerals known as conflict minerals which are mined from the democratic republic of congo drc and adjoining countries as well as procedures regarding a manufacturers efforts to identify the sourcing of such minerals and metals produced from those minerals in march and april 2017 the european parliament and the european council formally approved a conflict minerals regulation and the requirements will become effective starting in january 2021 we have incurred and will continue to incur additional costs in order to comply with the sec’s disclosure requirements in addition we might incur further costs due to possible changes to our products processes or sources of supply as a consequence of our due diligence activities as our supply chain is complex we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins of the specified minerals used in our products through our due diligence procedures which may harm our reputation in addition we may encounter challenges to satisfy those customers who require that all of the components of our products be certified as “drc conflict free” which could place us at a competitive disadvantage if we do not do so we filed our report for the calendar year 2018 with the sec on may 3 2019 

risks related to our common stock 

  

a significant majority of our voting stock is held by the schwartz family which could lead to conflicts of interest 

we have two classes of voting stock class a common stock and class b common stock with a few exceptions holders of class a and class b common stock vote as a single class when voting as a single class each share of class a common stock is entitled to onetenth of a vote while each share of class b common stock has one vote in the election or removal of directors the classes vote separately and the holders of class a common stock are entitled to elect 25 of the board of directors with holders of class b common stock electing the remaining directors 

as a result of the schwartz familys ownership of our class a and class b common stock they are able to elect a majority of our directors effect fundamental changes in our direction and control matters affecting us including the determination of business opportunities that may be suitable for our company the schwartz family may exercise its control over us according to interests that are different from other investors’ or debtors’ interests in particular this concentration of ownership and voting power may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

this discussion should be read in conjunction with the information contained in our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes which are an integral part of the statements 

overview  we are a multinational manufacturer and worldwide distributor of our own life science research and clinical diagnostics products our business is organized into two primary segments life science and clinical diagnostics with the mission to provide scientists with specialized tools needed for biological research and clinical diagnostics 

we sell more than 9000 products and services to a diverse client base comprised of scientific research healthcare education and government customers worldwide we do not disclose quantitative information about our different products and services as it is impractical to do so based primarily on the numerous products and services that we sell and the global markets that we serve 

we manufacture and supply our customers with a range of reagents apparatus and equipment to separate complex chemical and biological materials and to identify analyze and purify components because our customers require standardization for their experiments and test results much of our revenues are recurring 

we are impacted by the support of many governments for both research and healthcare the current global economic outlook is still uncertain as the need to control government social spending by many governments limits opportunities for growth adding to this uncertainty was the referendum in the united kingdom to withdraw from the european union approximately 39 of our 2019 consolidated net sales are derived from the united states and approximately 61 are derived from international locations with europe being our largest international region the international sales are largely denominated in local currencies such as the euro swiss franc japanese yen chinese yuan and british sterling as a result our consolidated net sales expressed in dollars benefit when the us dollar weakens and suffer when the dollar strengthens when the us dollar strengthens we benefit from lower cost of sales from our own international manufacturing sites as well as nonus suppliers and from lower international operating expenses we regularly discuss our changes in revenue and expense categories in terms of both changing foreign exchange rates and in terms of a currency neutral basis if notable to explain the impact currency has on our results 

cyberattack 

as we previously disclosed on december 9 2019 on a form 8k filed with the securities and exchange commission sec we detected a cyberattack on our network on the evening of december 5 2019 pst and immediately took affected systems offline as part of our comprehensive response to contain the activity “december 2019 cyberattack” the virus was targeted at windowsbased systems and did not attack our global erp system sap and other nonwindowsbased systems critical systems were back online within a few days of the incident as part of our indepth investigation into this incident we engaged outside cyber security experts to assist us with investigation and remediation efforts to date we have found no evidence of unauthorized transfer or misuse of personal data and there is no indication at this point that customer systems were affected we anticipate some ongoing expenses relating to this incident will continue into the first half of 2020 

we have insurance coverage for costs resulting from cyberattacks at this time we expect that our losses from this incident will exceed our insurance coverage we have not recorded any estimated proceeds resulting from an insurance claim regarding this incident since covered expenses as a result of this incident are still not yet quantified and in any case disputes over the extent of insurance coverage for claims are not uncommon we did not pay a ransom in connection with this incident 

acquisitions 

in october 2019 we acquired all the issued and outstanding shares of a foreign distributor for approximately 42 million  which included cash payments at closing net of closing cash of 36 million  and 06 million in contingent consideration potentially payable to the sellers in addition we recorded a net gain of 04 million for the settlement of preexisting conditions concurrent with the acquisition that was recorded in selling general and administrative expense the acquisition was included in our clinical diagnostics segments results of operations from the acquisition date and was accounted for as a business combination as of december 31 2019  the preliminary allocation of the payments was 34 million to customer relationships a definitelived intangible 02 million to deferred tax asset 08 million to deferred tax liability related to the purchased intangible and 14 million to acquired net assets 

in august 2019 we acquired all the issued and outstanding membership interests of exact diagnostics llc for approximately 600 million  cash payments at closing net of closing cash were 597 million  the acquisition was included in our clinical diagnostics segments results of operations from the acquisition date and was accounted for as a business combination the final allocation of the payments was 268 million to purchased intangibles consisting primarily of customer relationships developed product technology and tradenames 42 million to acquired net assets and 287 million to goodwill we believe that the acquisition will accelerate market penetration in the areas of quality controls and assay verification panels in our clinical diagnostics operations 

in march 2019 we completed the acquisition of all the issued and outstanding stock of a small us private company for approximately 200 million  cash payments net of closing cash consisted of 40 million paid in november 2018 and the remaining 160 million paid in march 2019 the acquisition was included in our life science segments results of operations from the acquisition date and was accounted for as a business combination the final allocation of the payments was 156 million to goodwill that included workforce and timetomarket advantage 55 million to definitelived intangibles 02 million to inprocess research and development an indefinitelived intangible asset and a deferred tax liability of 13 million related to the purchased intangibles we believe that the acquisition will expand our reagents suite of offerings in our life science operations 

the above acquisitions are immaterial to biorad taken as a whole for the periods presented 

restructuring costs for european and north american reorganization 

in november 2019 we announced our strategydriven restructuring plan we expect that a significant portion of the net savings resulting from this restructuring plan will be repurposed in alignment with our portfolio strategy the restructuring plan includes a workforce reduction in europe united states and canada and is expected to be incurred through 2020 we recorded 253 million of expense in restructuring charges related to severance and employee benefits for the year ended december 31 2019 the liability of 253 million as of december 31 2019 was recorded in accrued payroll and employee benefits in the consolidated balance sheets the amounts recorded were reflected in cost of goods sold of 48 million  in selling general and administrative expense of 144 million and in research and development expense of 61 million in the consolidated statements of income for the year ended december 31 2019  

restructuring costs for termination of a diagnostics research and development project and facility closures 

in december 2018 we announced the closure of a small manufacturing facility outside paris france we recorded restructuring charges and adjustments related to severance and employee benefits of 01 million and 39 million and exit costs of zero and 02 million for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018  respectively from december 2018 to december 31 2019  total expenses were 40 million  

in june 2018 we announced the closure of a small manufacturing operation in munich germany we recorded restructuring charges and adjustments related to severance and employee benefits of 03 million and 17 million for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018  respectively from june 2018 to december 31 2019  total expenses were 14 million  this restructuring plan was completed in november 2019 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the accompanying discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities and contingencies as of the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis we base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources however future events may cause us to change our assumptions and estimates which may require adjustment actual results could differ from these estimates we have determined that for the periods reported in this annual report on form 10k the following accounting policies and estimates are critical in understanding our financial condition and results of operations 

accounting for income taxes management is required to make estimates related to our income tax provision in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate this process involves estimating our current tax exposures as well as making judgments regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets in each jurisdiction deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect the tax effects of net operating losses tax credits and temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes management assesses the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent management believes that recovery is not likely a valuation allowance must be established to the extent management establishes a valuation allowance or increases this allowance in a period an increase to expense within the provision for income taxes in the consolidated statements of income may result 

as of december 31 2019 and 2018  we recorded a valuation allowance of 672 million and 708 million  respectively due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize deferred tax assets in some jurisdictions the valuation allowance is based on management’s current estimates of taxable income for the jurisdictions in which we operate and the period over which the deferred tax assets will be recoverable in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or these estimates are adjusted in future periods an additional valuation allowance may need to be established which would increase the tax provision lowering income and impacting our financial position should realization of these deferred tax assets for which a valuation allowance has been provided occur the provision for income taxes may decrease raising income and positively impacting biorad’s financial position 

we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements on a particular tax position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon settlement the amount of unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted as appropriate for changes in facts and circumstances such as significant amendments to existing tax law new regulations or interpretations by the taxing authorities new information obtained during a tax examination or resolution of an examination we recognize both accrued interest and penalties where appropriate related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense our overall effective tax rate is subject to fluctuations because of changes in the geographic mix of earnings changes to statutory tax rates and tax laws and because of the impact of various tax audits and assessments as well as generation of tax credits 

on december 22 2017 the us enacted comprehensive tax legislation the “tax act” the tax act made broad and complex changes to the us tax code including the imposition of a onetime mandatory deemed repatriation tax “transition tax” on certain earnings accumulated offshore since 1986 and the reduction of the corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 for us taxable income resulting in a onetime remeasurement of us federal deferred tax assets and liabilities in 2017 we recorded an income tax benefit of 70 million related to the transition tax and remeasurement of our us federal deferred tax assets and liabilities we completed our accounting for the tax act under staff accounting bulletin no 118 income tax accounting implications of the tax cuts and jobs act “sab 118” in 2018 which resulted in an additional income tax benefit of 49 million  

valuation of business acquisitions goodwill and longlived assets upon the consummation of a business combination we use multiple analyses to determine the fair market value of the consideration of assets acquired and liabilities assumed once the fair market value of the acquired business is determined any residual value between fair market value and the consideration is defined as goodwill 

goodwill represents the excess of the cost over the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses which could include contingent consideration contingent consideration is an obligation of the acquirer to transfer additional assets or equity interest to the former owners of an acquiree as part of the exchange for control of the acquiree if specified future events occur or conditions are met contingent consideration is reported at fair value each reporting period until the contingency is resolved any changes in fair value are recognized in earnings which could become volatile over time depending on the facts and circumstances 

goodwill amounts are assigned to reporting units at the time of acquisition and are adjusted for any subsequent significant transfers of business between reporting units we assess the impairment of goodwill annually in the fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable we perform the impairment tests of goodwill at our reporting unit level which is one level below our operating segments a goodwill impairment will be the amount by which a reporting units carrying value exceeds its fair value not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill 

we use a projected discounted cash flow model to determine the fair value of a reporting unit this discounted cash flow method for determining goodwill may be different from the fair value that would result from an actual transaction between a willing buyer and a willing seller projections such as discounted cash flow models are inherently uncertain and accordingly actual future cash flows may differ materially from projected cash flows management judgment is required in developing the assumptions for the discounted cash flow model these assumptions include revenue growth rates profit margins and discount rates in addition for some diagnostic units where they supply reagent rental equipment capital expenditures can have a significant impact we estimate future cash flows using current and longerterm financial forecasts these forecasts take into account the current economic environment the discount rates used are compiled using independent sources current trends in similar businesses and other observable market data changes to these rates might result in material changes in the valuation and determination of the recoverability of goodwill for example an increase in the discount rate used to discount cash flows will decrease the computed fair value 

impairment tests are highly sensitive to changes in assumptions and minor changes to assumptions could result in impairment losses our forecasts utilized in our 2019 impairment test assumed among other things sales growth from executing our sales and marketing programs new product introductions successful product development and timely registration of our products when required while controlling costs to manufacture and service our equipment at the customer site in addition external factors such as competitive pricing in the market currency inflation rates cost of capital and forecasted tax rates could affect the determination of fair value of our reporting units our impairment tests resulted in excessive fair value over book value ranging from 75 to more than 400 for our various reporting units if the initiatives mentioned above do not achieve the desired results or external factors change detrimentally future impairment losses may occur 

to validate the reasonableness of the reporting unit fair values we reconcile the aggregate fair values of the reporting units to the enterprise market capitalization in performing the reconciliation we may depending on the volatility of the market value of our stock price use either the stock price on the valuation date or the average stock price over a range of dates around the valuation date 

for purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment loss a longlived asset or assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities we assess the impairment of longlived assets including identifiable intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable in addition to the required quantitative review we also review quarterly qualitative factors that we consider important which could trigger an impairment review and include 



when management determines that the carrying value of longlived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment we test for any impairment based on a projected undiscounted cash flow method projected future operating results and cash flows of the asset or asset group are used to establish the fair value used in evaluating the carrying value of longlived and intangible assets we estimate the future cash flows of the longlived assets using current and longterm financial forecasts the carrying amount of a longlived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset if this is the case an impairment loss would be recognized the impairment loss recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value 

in conjunction with our annual valuation of goodwill there were no impairment losses in 2019 in 2018 we impaired goodwill associated with our 1999 acquisition of pasteur sanofi diagnostics sa 2007 through 2012 acquisitions of diamed holding ag diamed fennica oy diamed gb limited and diamed benelux collectively diamed 2010 acquisition of biotest ag and 2013 acquisition of abd serotec in the amounts of 181 million  2472 million  108 million and 59 million  respectively goodwill for diamed biotest ag and abd serotec was fully impaired at december 31 2018 in 2018 we impaired developed product technology and fully impaired covenants not to compete in the amounts of 88 million and 17 million  respectively associated with our 2012 acquisition of a cell sorting system from propel labs inc 

in 2017 we impaired goodwill associated with our 1999 acquisition of pasteur sanofi diagnostics sa and with our 2013 acquisition of abd serotec in the amounts of 28 million and 87 million  respectively 

all the impairments above were based upon a revision of our level 3 valuation inputs ie expected future cash flows 

revenue recognition we recognize revenue from operations through the sale of products services and rental of instruments revenue from contracts with customers is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services we enter into contracts that can include various combinations of products and services which are generally accounted for as distinct performance obligations revenue is recognized net of any taxes collected from customers sales tax value added tax etc which are subsequently remitted to government authorities 

our contracts from customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment and may or may not impact the timing of revenue recognition revenue associated with equipment that requires factory installation is not recorded until installation is complete and customer acceptance if required has occurred certain equipment requires installation due to the fact that the instruments are being operated in a clinicallaboratory environment and the installation services could result in modification of the equipment in order to ensure that the instruments are working according to specifications of the customer which are subject to validation tests upon completion of the installation in these arrangements which require factory installation the delivery of the equipment and the installation are separate performance obligations we will recognize the transaction price allocated to the equipment only upon customer acceptance as the transfer of control has occurred in relation to the equipment at that point in time as the customer has the ability to direct the use of and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from the asset the transaction price allocated to the installation services is also recognized upon completion of the services because without the completion of the installation services and related customer acceptance the customer cannot receive any of the benefits of the service 

at the time revenue is recognized a provision is recognized for estimated product returns as this right is considered variable consideration accordingly when product revenues are recognized the transaction price is reduced by the estimated amount of product returns 

service revenues on extended warranty contracts are recognized ratably over the life of the service agreement as a standready performance obligation for arrangements that include a combination of products and services transaction prices are allocated to performance obligations based on standalone selling prices the method used to determine the standalone selling prices for service revenues is based on the observable prices when the services have been sold separately 

reagent rental agreements are a diagnostic industry sales method that provides use of an instrument and consumables reagents to a customer on a per test basis these agreements may also include maintenance of the underlying instruments retained at customer locations as well as initial training we initially determine if a reagent rental arrangement contains a lease at lease commencement where we have determined that such an arrangement contains a lease we next must ascertain its lease classification for purposes of applying appropriate accounting treatment as an operating salestype or direct financing lease in addition for purposes of determining the lease term used in performing the lease classification test we include the noncancellable period of the lease together with those periods covered by the option to extend the lease if the customer is reasonably certain to exercise that option the periods covered by an option to terminate the lease if the customer is reasonably certain not to exercise that option and the periods covered by the option to extend or not to terminate the lease in which exercise of the option is controlled by the company while most of our reagent rental arrangements contain either the option for a lessee to extend andor cancel the period in which the contract is enforceable is a very short period and therefore the lease term has been limited to the noncancellable period furthermore it has historically been very rare for these arrangements to contain an option for the lessee to purchase the underlying asset 

valuation of inventories we value inventory at the lower of the actual cost to purchase andor manufacture the inventory or the current estimated net realizable value of the inventory we review inventory quantities on hand and reduce the cost basis of excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on an estimated forecast of product demand production requirements and the quality efficacy and potency of raw materials this review is done on a quarterly basis or if warranted by the circumstances more frequently in addition our industry is characterized by technological change frequent new product development and product obsolescence that could result in an increase in the amount of obsolete inventory quantities on hand our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate and if too high we may have overstated the carrying value of our inventory in the future if inventory is determined to be overvalued we would be required to write down the value of inventory to market and recognize such costs in our cost of goods sold at the time of such determination therefore although we make efforts to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand and perform procedures to safeguard overall inventory quality any significant unanticipated changes in demand technological developments regulations storage conditions or other economic or environmental factors affecting biological materials could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and reported results of operations 

results of operations  sales gross margins and expenses  incorporating by reference the results of operations  sales gross margins and expenses from our annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ended december 31 2018 

the following shows cost of goods sold gross profit expense items and net income as a percentage of net sales 



net sales 

n et sales sales in 2019 were 231 billion  an increase of 10 compared to 229 billion in 2018  excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 2019 sales increased by approximately 33 compared to 2018  currency neutral sales increased in all regions 

the life science segment sales in 2019 were 8859 million  an increase of 28 compared to 2018  on a currency neutral basis sales increased 46 compared to 2018  the currency neutral sales increase was primarily driven by growth in our droplet digital™ pcr food safety and process media product lines currency neutral sales increases occurred mostly in the americas and europe sales in asia were most impacted by the december 2019 cyberattack  

the clinical diagnostics segment sales in 2019 were 141 billion  relatively flat compared to 2018  on a currency neutral basis sales increased 28 compared to 2018  the currency neutral sales in 2018 benefited from a onetime 60 million receipt for the resolution of a dispute involving a licensed patent excluding the onetime receipt last year we saw currency neutral sales growth across all three regions primarily in the americas and asia product lines that contributed to the growth included quality controls blood typing immunology and diabetes management expects sales growth in europe to continue to be challenging due to government initiatives to contain healthcare spending along with increased competition 

gross margin 

consolidated gross margins were 544 in 2019 compared to 534 in 2018  life science segment gross margins in 2019 increased when compared to 2018 by approximately 27 percentage points primarily due to 74 million and 15 million of cost of sales benefits in 2019 from escrow releases related to 2011 and 2017 acquisitions within the life science group respectively and product mix as well as a decrease in service costs clinical diagnostics segment gross margins in 2019 were flat compared to 2018  unfavorable manufacturing costs included restructuring costs lower absorption and higher service costs primarily associated with a larger installed base these costs were primarily offset by lower excess and obsolete inventory related costs logistics costs and royalty expenses the gross margin in 2018 benefited from a onetime receipt of 60 million for the resolution of a dispute involving a licensed patent partially offset by a restructuring charge related to a manufacturing facility closure 

selling general and administrative expense 

consolidated selling general and administrative expenses sga decreased to 8246 million or 357 of sales in 2019 compared to 8348 million or 365 of sales in 2018  an overall decrease of 102 million  decreases to sga primarily were related to lower professional fees of 277 million lower bad debt of 146 million and lower travel of 86 million decreases in sga were partially offset primarily by increases in employee related expenses of 408 million which included higher expenses associated with the restructuring plans in 2019 compared to those in 2018 

research and development expense 

research and development expense increased to 2027 million or 88 of sales in 2019 compared to 1992 million or 87 of sales in 2018  life science segment research and development expense increased in 2019 from 2018  primarily driven by additional spending for personnel outside consultants and supplies that were related to new product innovation within the droplet digital pcr product line clinical diagnostics segment research and development expense decreased in 2019 from 2018 primarily from lower spending due to the timing of projects that led to lower outside professional services expense and lower supplies expense partially offset by the restructuring plan in the fourth quarter of 2019 

impairment losses on goodwill and longlived assets 

in conjunction with our annual valuation of goodwill there were no impairment losses in 2019 in 2018 we impaired goodwill associated with our 1999 acquisition of pasteur sanofi diagnostics sa 2007 through 2012 acquisitions of diamed holding ag diamed fennica oy diamed gb limited and diamed benelux collectively diamed 2010 acquisition of biotest ag and 2013 acquisition of abd serotec in the amounts of 181 million  2472 million  108 million and 59 million  respectively goodwill for diamed biotest ag and abd serotec was fully impaired at december 31 2018 impairments for the pasteur sanofi diagnostics sa diamed and biotest ag were included in our clinical diagnostics segments results of operations and the impairment for abd serotec was included in our life science segments results of operations 

in 2018 we impaired developed product technology and fully impaired covenants not to compete in the amounts of 88 million and 17 million  respectively associated with our 2012 acquisition of a cell sorting system from propel labs inc these impairments were included in our life science segments results of operations 

results of operations – nonoperating 

interest expense 

interest expense in 2019 was 234 million  a slight decrease compared to 2018 of 240 million  

foreign currency exchange gains and losses 

foreign currency exchange gains and losses consist primarily of foreign currency transaction gains and losses on intercompany net receivables and payables and the change in fair value of our forward foreign exchange contracts used to manage our foreign currency exchange risk net foreign currency exchange losses for 2019 and 2018 were 22 million and 29 million  respectively the 2019 and 2018 net foreign currency exchange losses were attributable to market volatility the result of the estimating process inherent in the timing of shipments and payments of intercompany debt and the cost of hedging all years are affected by the economic hedging program we employ to hedge our intercompany receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies 

change in fair market value of equity securities 

change in fair market value of equity securities were gains of 20310 million for 2019 compared to 6062 million for 2018  primarily resulting from the recognition of holding gains on our investment in sartorius ag 

other income expense net 

other income expense net includes investment and dividend income interest income on our cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and long term marketable securities other income expense net in 2019 decreased to 261 million of income compared to 366 million of income in 2018  other income net decreased primarily due to a land sale of 41 million and a divestiture of a product line of 51 million that both occurred in 2018 and higher otherthantemporary impairment losses on equity method investments that were recorded in light of the investees financial condition in 2019 

effective tax rate 

our effective tax rate was 222 and 287 in 2019 and 2018  respectively the effective tax rate for 2018 was driven by detriments due to nondeductible impairment charges and the taxation of our foreign operations partially offset by a 49 million benefit recorded as a result of the completion of our accounting for the tax act under sab 118 our effective tax rate may be impacted in the future either favorably or unfavorably by many factors including but not limited to changes in the geographic mix of earnings changes to statutory tax rates changes in tax laws or regulations tax audits and settlements and generation of tax credits 

our income tax returns are routinely audited by us federal state and foreign tax authorities we are currently under examination by many of these tax authorities there are differing interpretations of tax laws and regulations and as a result significant disputes may arise with these tax authorities involving issues of the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions we do not believe any currently pending uncertain tax positions will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements although an adverse resolution of one or more of these uncertain tax positions in any period may have a material impact on the results of operations for that period 

we record liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions we do not believe the resolution of our uncertain tax positions will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements although an adverse resolution of one or more of these uncertain tax positions in any period may have a material impact on the results of operations for that period 

as of december 31 2019  based on the expected outcome of certain examinations or as a result of the expiration of statutes of limitation for certain jurisdictions we believe that within the next twelve months it is reasonably possible that our previously unrecognized tax benefits could decrease by approximately 28 million  substantially all such amounts will impact our effective income tax rate 

comparison of the year ended december 31 2018 to the year ended december 31 2017 

refer to item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations located in our annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ended december 31 2018 filed on april 16 2019 for the discussion of the comparison of the fiscal year ended december 31 2018 to the fiscal year ended december 31 2017 the earliest of the three fiscal years presented in the consolidated statements of operations 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

biorad operates and conducts business globally primarily through subsidiary companies established in the markets in which we trade goods are manufactured in a small number of locations and are then shipped to local distribution facilities around the world our product mix is diversified and certain products compete largely on product efficacy while others compete on price gross margins are generally sufficient to exceed normal operating costs and funding for research and development of new products as well as routine outflows of capital expenditures interest and taxes in addition to the annual positive cash flow from operating activities additional liquidity is readily available via the sale of shortterm investments and access to our domestic 2000 million unsecured credit agreement that we entered into in april 2019 and to a lesser extent international lines of credit borrowings under the 2019 credit agreement are available on a revolving basis and can be used to make permitted acquisitions for working capital and for other general corporate purposes we had no outstanding borrowings under the 2019 credit agreement as of december 31 2019  however 02 million was utilized for domestic standby letters of credit that reduced our borrowing availability the 2019 credit agreement matures in april 2024 in total under domestic and international lines of credit standby letters of credit and guarantee arrangements we had approximately 2075 million available for borrowing and usage as of december 31 2019  which was reduced by approximately 42 million that was utilized for standby letters of credit and guarantee arrangements issued by our banks to support our obligations management believes that this availability together with cash flow from operations will be adequate to meet our current objectives for operations research and development capital additions for manufacturing and distribution plant and equipment information technology systems and an acquisition of reasonable proportion to our existing total available capital however we have outstanding 4250 million principal amount of senior notes that are due in december 2020  4875 notes we are currently assessing the repayment of the 4875 notes and believe we have adequate resources to repay or finance this obligation 

  

at december 31 2019  we had available 11146 million in cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments of which approximately 21 was held in our foreign subsidiaries we believe that our holdings of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments in the us and in our foreign subsidiaries are sufficient to meet both the current and longterm needs of our global operations the amount of funds held in the united states can fluctuate due to the timing of receipts and payments in the ordinary course of business and due to other reasons such as businessdevelopment activities as part of our ongoing liquidity assessments we regularly monitor the mix of domestic and foreign cash flows both inflows and outflows 

it is generally our intention to repatriate certain foreign earnings to the extent that such repatriations are not restricted by local laws or accounting rules and there are no substantial incremental costs 

demand for our products and services could change more dramatically than in previous years based on activity funding reimbursement constraints and support levels from government universities hospitals and private industry including diagnostic laboratories the need for certain sovereign nations with large annual deficits to curtail spending and international trade disputes and increased regulation could lead to slower growth of or even a decline in our business sovereign nations either delaying payment for goods and services or renegotiating their debts could impact our liquidity 

cash flows from operations 

net cash provided by operations was 4579 million and 2855 million in 2019 and 2018  respectively the net increase between 2019 and 2018 of 1724 million primarily resulted from 

 

cash flows from operations during the first quarter have historically had larger payments for royalties fourth quarter sales commissions to third parties and annual employee bonuses and we expect this pattern to recur in the first quarter of 2020  

cash flows from investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities was 2089 million and 1870 million for 2019 and 2018  respectively the net increase between 2019 and 2018 of 219 million was primarily due to payments for acquisitions in 2019 and to a lesser extent proceeds for a divestiture of a product line in 2018 as discussed below these were partially offset primarily by lower capital expenditures in 2019 than in 2018 as discussed below and for sales of marketable securities and investments that increased by 276 million in 2019 compared to 2018 other items that affected cash flows from investing activities are further discussed below 

our investment objective is to maintain liquidity to meet anticipated operational and other corporate requirements in which capital is preserved and increased through investing in low risk high quality securities with commensurate returns consistent with our risk tolerance level 

during the first quarter of 2019 we received 74 million from an escrow release related to an acquisition from 2011 within the life science group during the first quarter of 2018 we received 70 million for a divestiture of a product line and 41 million for a land sale 

in october 2019 we acquired all the issued and outstanding shares of a foreign distributor for approximately 42 million  which included cash payments at closing net of closing cash of 36 million  and 06 million in contingent consideration potentially payable to the sellers the acquisition does not meet the significant or material subsidiary test the purchase price allocation is preliminary as additional time is required to complete the valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 

in august 2019 we acquired all the issued and outstanding membership interests of exact diagnostics llc for approximately 600 million cash payments at closing net of closing cash were 597 million the acquisition does not meet the significant or material subsidiary test 

in march 2019 we completed the acquisition of all the issued and outstanding stock of a small us private company for approximately 200 million cash payments net of closing cash consisted of 40 million paid in november 2018 and the remaining 160 million paid in march 2019 the acquisition does not meet the significant or material subsidiary test 

the above acquisitions are immaterial to biorad taken as a whole for the periods presented 

we continue to review possible acquisitions including early stage businesses to expand both our life science and clinical diagnostics segments we routinely meet with the principals or brokers of the subject companies however it is not certain at this time that any of these discussions will advance to completion 

capital expenditures in 2019 totaled 985 million  compared to 1298 million in 2018  capital expenditures represent the addition and replacement of production machinery and research equipment ongoing manufacturing and facility additions for expansion regulatory environmental and compliance also included in capital expenditures are investments in business systems and data communication upgrades and enhancements including the remaining phases of the global enterprise resource planning erp platform all periods include equipment placed with clinical diagnostics segment customers who then contract to purchase our reagents for use capital expenditures were lower in 2019 than in 2018 primarily due to implementing smaller phases of the erp platform in addition in 2018 we made an investment in two office buildings and adjacent land in the greater san francisco bay area california 

cash flows from financing activities 

  

net cash used in financing activities was 228 million compared to 487 million in 2019 and 2018  respectively net cash used in financing activities was lower in 2019 than 2018 primarily due to lower repurchases of our common stock in 2019 than in 2018 of 209 million 

we have outstanding 4875 notes of 4250 million which are due in december 2020 we are currently assessing the repayment of the 4875 notes and believe we have adequate resources to repay or finance this obligation 

we believe the current cash is sufficient to meet normal operating costs and funding for research and development of new products as well as routine outflows of capital expenditures interest and taxes 

  

treasury shares 

during 2019 137748 shares of our class a treasury stock and 917 shares of our class b treasury stock with an aggregate total cost of 387 million were reissued to fulfill annual grants to employees under our restricted stock program and to fulfill our employee stock purchase plan purchases upon reissuing the class a and b treasury stock under our restricted stock program a loss of 84 million was incurred as they were reissued at a lower price than their average cost which reduced retained earnings while 249 million reduced additional paidincapital these reissuances for the restricted stock program did not require cash payments or receipts and therefore did not affect liquidity upon fulfilling our employee stock purchase plan purchases a loss of 16 million was incurred as they were issued at a lower price than the average cost which reduced retained earnings and resulted in net proceeds of 38 million 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements that have had or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

contractual obligations 

the following summarizes certain of our contractual obligations as of december 31 2019 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our cash flows in future periods in millions

item 7a quantitive and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

financial risk management 

the main goal of biorad’s financial risk management program is to reduce the variance in expected cash flows arising from unexpected foreign exchange rate and interest rate changes financial exposures are managed through operational means and by using various financial instruments including cash and liquid resources borrowings and forward and spot foreign exchange contracts no derivative financial instruments are entered into for the purpose of trading or speculation company policy requires that all derivative positions are undertaken to manage the risks arising from underlying business activities these derivative transactions do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment derivative instruments used in these transactions are valued at fair value and changes in fair value are included in reported earnings 

foreign exchange risk we operate and conduct business in many countries and are exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates we face transactional currency exposures that arise when we enter into transactions denominated in currencies other than us dollars additionally our consolidated net equity is impacted by the conversion of the net assets of our international subsidiaries for which the functional currency is not the us dollar 

foreign currency exposures are managed on a centralized basis this allows for the netting of natural offsets and lowers transaction costs and net exposures where possible we seek to manage our foreign exchange risk in part through operational means including matching samecurrency revenues to samecurrency costs and samecurrency assets to samecurrency liabilities moreover weakening in one currency can often be offset by strengthening in another currency foreign exchange risk is also managed through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts positions are primarily in euro swiss franc japanese yen chinese yuan and british sterling the majority of forward contracts are for periods of 90 days or less we record the change in value of our foreign currency receivables and payables as a foreign exchange gain loss on our consolidated statements of income along with the change in fair market value of the forward exchange contract used as an economic hedge of those assets or liabilities 

our forward contract holdings at yearend were analyzed to determine their sensitivity to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates all other variables were held constant market risk associated with derivative holdings is the potential change in fair value of derivative positions arising from an adverse movement in foreign exchange rates a decline of 10 on quoted foreign exchange rates would result in an approximate netpresentvalue loss of 25 million on our derivative position as of december 31 2019  this impact of a change in exchange rates excludes the offset derived from the change in value of the underlying assets and liabilities which could reduce the adverse effect significantly 

interest rate risk of debt instruments biorad centrally manages the shortterm cash surpluses and shortfalls of its subsidiaries our holdings of variable rate debt instruments at yearend were analyzed to determine their sensitivity to movements in interest rates due to the relatively small amount of shortterm variable rate debt we have outstanding there would not be a material impact to earnings or cash flows if interest rates moved adversely by 10 our longterm debt consists primarily of fixedrate instruments and is thus insulated from interest rate changes as of december 31 2019  the overall interest rate risk associated with our debt was not significant

 item 1 business 

tableend

general 

founded in 1952 and incorporated in 1957 biorad laboratories inc referred to in this report as “biorad” “we” “us” and “our” was initially engaged in the development and production of specialty chemicals used in biochemical pharmaceutical and other life science research applications we entered the field of clinical diagnostics with the development of our first test kit based on separation techniques and materials developed for life science research through internal research and development efforts and acquisitions we have expanded into various markets today biorad manufactures and supplies the life science research healthcare analytical chemistry and other markets with a broad range of products and systems used to separate complex chemical and biological materials and to identify analyze and purify their components 

as we broadened our product lines we also expanded our geographical market we have direct distribution channels in over 35 countries outside the united states through subsidiaries whose focus is sales customer service and product distribution in some locations outside and inside these 35 countries sales efforts are supplemented by distributors and agents 

description of business 

business segments 

today biorad operates in two industry segments designated as life science and clinical diagnostics both segments operate worldwide our life science segment and our clinical diagnostics segment generated 35 and 64  respectively of our net sales for the year ended december 31 2016  we generated approximately 37 of our consolidated net sales for the year ended december 31 2016 from us sales and approximately 63 from sales in our remaining worldwide markets 

for a description of business and financial information on industry and geographic segments see note 14 of item 8 of part ii of this report 

life science segment 

our life science segment is at the forefront of discovery creating advanced tools to answer complex biological questions we are a leader in the life sciences market and develop manufacture and market a range of more than 5000 reagents apparatus and laboratory instruments that serve a global customer base many of our products are 

used in established research techniques biopharmaceutical production processes and food testing regimes these techniques are typically used to separate purify and identify biological materials such as proteins nucleic acids and bacteria within a laboratory or production setting we focus on selected segments of the life sciences market in proteomics the study of proteins genomics the study of genes biopharmaceutical production cell biology and food safety we estimate that the worldwide market for products in these selected segments was approximately 

8 billion our principal life science customers include universities and medical schools industrial research organizations government agencies pharmaceutical manufacturers biotechnology researchers food producers and food testing laboratories 

clinical diagnostics segment 

our clinical diagnostics segment designs manufactures sells and supports test systems informatics systems test kits and specialized quality controls that serve clinical laboratories in the global diagnostics market our products currently address specific niches within the in vitro diagnostics ivd test market and we seek to focus on the higher margin higher growth segments of this market 

we supply more than 3000 different products that cover more than 300 clinical diagnostic tests to the ivd test market we estimate that the worldwide sales for products in the markets we serve were approximately 12 billion ivd tests are conducted outside the human body and are used to identify and measure substances in a patient’s tissue blood or urine our products consist of reagents instruments and software typically provided to our customers as an integrated package to allow them to generate reproducible test results revenue in this business is highly recurring as laboratories typically standardize test methodologies which are dependent on a particular supplier’s equipment reagents and consumable products an installed base of diagnostic test systems therefore typically creates an ongoing source of revenue through the sale of test kits for each sample analyzed on an installed system our principal clinical diagnostic customers include hospital laboratories reference laboratories transfusion laboratories and physician office laboratories 

raw materials and components 

we utilize a wide variety of chemicals biological materials electronic components machined metal parts optical parts computing and peripheral devices most of these materials and components are available from numerous sources and generally we have not experienced difficulty in securing adequate supplies however in certain instances we acquire components and materials from a sole supplier due to the regulatory environment in which we operate we may be unable to quickly establish additional or replacement sources for some components or materials 

patents trademarks and licenses 

we own numerous us and international patents and trademarks we also pay royalties on the sales of certain products under several patent license agreements we view these patents trademarks and license agreements as valuable assets however we believe that our ability to develop and manufacture our products depends primarily on our knowledge technology and special skills rather than our patent trademark and licensing positions 

seasonal operations and backlog 

our business is not inherently seasonal however the european custom of concentrating vacation during the summer months usually tempers third quarter sales volume and operating income 

for the most part we operate in markets characterized by short lead times and the absence of significant backlogs management has concluded that backlog information is not material to our business as a whole 

sales and marketing 

we conduct our worldwide operations through an extensive direct sales force employing approximately 990 direct sales and sales management personnel around the world our sales force typically consists of experienced industry practitioners with scientific training and we maintain a separate specialist sales force for each of our segments we believe that this direct sales approach allows us to sell a broader range of our products and have more direct contact with our customers 

we also use a range of sales and marketing intermediaries smis in our international markets the types of smis we utilize are distributors agents brokers and resellers we have programs and policies in place with our smis that require compliance with all applicable laws including adhering to our anticorruption standards to ensure a transparent sale to our customers 

our customer base is broad and diversified our worldwide customer base includes 1 prominent university and research institutions providing us access to more than 180000 scientists in the united states alone 2 hospital public health and commercial laboratories 3 other leading diagnostic manufacturers and 4 leading companies in the biotechnology pharmaceutical chemical and food industries in 2016  no single customer accounted for more than three percent of our total net sales our sales are affected by a number of external factors for example a number of our customers particularly in the life science segment are substantially dependent on government grants and research contracts for their funding a significant reduction of government funding has in the past and could in the future have a detrimental effect on the results of this segment 

most of our international sales are generated by our whollyowned subsidiaries and their branch offices certain of these subsidiaries also have manufacturing facilities biorad’s international operations are subject to certain risks common to foreign operations in general such as changes in governmental regulations import restrictions and foreign exchange fluctuations 

competition 

the markets served by our product groups are highly competitive our competitors range in size from startups to large multinational corporations with significant resources and reach we seek to compete primarily in market segments where our products and technology offer customers specific advantages over the competition 

because of the breadth of its product lines our life science segment does not face the same competitors for all of its products competitors in this market include ge biosciences merck millipore and thermo fisher scientific we compete primarily based on meeting performance specifications and offering complete solutions 

major competitors of our clinical diagnostics segment include roche abbott laboratories siemens danaher thermo fisher becton dickinson biomérieux ortho clinical diagnostics tosoh immucor and diasorin 

research and development 

we conduct extensive research and development activities in all areas of our business employing approximately 875 employees worldwide in these activities including degreed scientists and technical support staff research and development has played a major role in biorad’s growth and is expected to continue to do so in the future our research teams are continuously developing new products and new applications for existing products in our development of new products and applications we interact with scientific and medical professionals at universities hospitals and medical schools and within our industry we spent approximately 2059 million  1930 million and 2203 million on research and development activities in 2016  2015 and 2014  respectively 

regulatory matters 

the development testing manufacturing marketing postmarket surveillance distribution advertising and labeling of certain of our products primarily diagnostic products are subject to regulation in the united states by the center for devices and radiological health of the us food and drug administration fda and in other jurisdictions by state and foreign government authorities fda regulations require that some new products have premarketing clearance or approval by the fda and require certain products to be manufactured in accordance with fda’s “good manufacturing practice” regulations to be extensively tested and to be properly labeled to disclose test results and performance claims and limitations after a product that is subject to fda regulation is placed on the market numerous regulatory requirements apply including for example the requirement that we comply with recordkeeping and reporting requirements such as the fda’s medical device reporting regulations and reporting of corrections and removals the fda enforces these requirements by inspection and market surveillance the fda has authority to take various administrative and legal actions against us for our or our products’ failure to comply with relevant legal or regulatory requirements including issuing warning letters initiating product seizures requesting or requiring product recalls or withdrawals and other civil or criminal sanctions among other things 

we are also subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business such laws include without limitation state and federal antikickback fraud and abuse false claims privacy and security and physician sunshine laws and regulations if our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to us we may be subject to penalties including without limitation civil and criminal penalties damages fines the curtailment or restructuring of our operations exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results 

sales of our products will depend in part on the extent to which our products or diagnostic tests using our products will be covered by thirdparty payors such as government health care programs commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations these thirdparty payors are increasingly reducing reimbursements for certain medical products and services in addition the us government state legislatures and foreign governments have continued implementing cost containment programs including price controls and restrictions on reimbursement adoption of price controls and costcontainment measures and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures could further limit our net revenue and results decreases in thirdparty reimbursement for our products or diagnostic tests using our products or a decision by a thirdparty payor to not cover our products could reduce or eliminate utilization of our products and have a material adverse effect on our sales results of operations and financial condition in addition healthcare reform measures have been and will be adopted in the future any of which could limit the amounts that governments will pay for healthcare products and services which could result in reduced demand for our products or additional pricing pressures 

as a multinational manufacturer and distributor of sophisticated instrumentation we must meet a wide array of electromagnetic compatibility and safety compliance requirements to satisfy regulations in the united states the european union and other jurisdictions 

our operations are subject to federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations that govern such activities as transportation of goods emissions to air and discharges to water as well as handling and disposal practices for solid hazardous and medical wastes in addition to environmental laws that regulate our operations we are also subject to environmental laws and regulations that create liabilities and cleanup responsibility for spills disposals or other releases of hazardous substances into the environment as a result of our operations or otherwise impacting real property that we own or operate the environmental laws and regulations could also subject us to claims by third parties for damages resulting from any spills disposals or releases resulting from our operations or at any of our properties 

these regulatory requirements vary widely among countries 

employees 

at december 31 2016  biorad had approximately 8250 employees approximately seven percent of our approximately 3300 us employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement which will expire on november 7 2019 many of our nonus fulltime employees especially in france are covered by collective bargaining agreements we consider our employee relations in general to be good 

available information 

biorad files annual quarterly and current reports proxy statements and other documents with the securities and exchange commission sec under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the public may read and copy any materials that we file with the sec at the sec’s public reference room at 100 f street ne washington dc 20549 the public may obtain information on the operation of the public reference room by calling the sec at 1800sec0330 also the sec maintains an internet website that contains reports proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers including biorad that file electronically with the sec the public can obtain any documents that we file with the sec at httpwwwsecgov  

biorad’s website address is wwwbioradcom  we make available free of charge through our website our form 10ks 10qs and 8ks and any amendments to these forms as soon as reasonably practicable after filing with the sec the information on our website is not part of this annual report on form 10k 




 item 1a risk factors 

in evaluating our business and whether to invest in any of our securities you should carefully read the following risk factors in addition to the other information contained in this annual report we believe that any of the following risks could have a material effect on our business results of operations or financial condition our industry or the trading price of our common stock we operate in a continually changing business environment and new risks and uncertainties emerge from time to time we cannot predict these new risks and uncertainties nor can we assess the extent to which any such new risks and uncertainties or the extent to which the risks and uncertainties set forth below may adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition our industry or the trading price of our common stock 

our settlement with government agencies in connection with violations by us of the us foreign corrupt practices act could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

as previously disclosed we entered into a nonprosecution agreement npa with the us department of justice doj and the securities and exchange commission sec and consented to the entry of an order by the sec sec order effective november 3 2014 which actions resolved both the doj and the sec investigations into our violations of the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa under the terms of the npa and the sec order we agreed to pay a financial penalty and certain amounts in disgorgement and interest as well as to compliance reporting and cooperation obligations to be performed for two years on october 28 2016 the doj and sec informed biorad that they did not intend to extend the npa after it expired november 2 2016 

whether by virtue of disclosure of the npa and the sec order or otherwise we may be subject to investigations by foreign governments or further claims by third parties arising from conduct subject to the investigation or our other international operations for additional information regarding further claims by third parties see note 13 “legal proceedings” in the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements of part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k many of our customers in our significant international operations are government agencies or stateowned or statecontrolled universities hospitals and laboratories the disclosure of the npa and the sec order could harm our reputation with these customers which could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

our international operations expose us to additional costs and legal and regulatory risks which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we have significant international operations we have direct distribution channels in over 35 countries outside the united states and in 2016 our foreign subsidiaries generated 63 of our net sales compliance with complex foreign and us laws and regulations that apply to our international operations increases our cost of doing business these numerous and sometimes conflicting laws and regulations include among others data privacy requirements including with respect to the invalidation of the useuropean union safe harbor by the european court of justice compliance with the euus privacy shield recently adopted by the european commission and the upcoming requirements for compliance with the eu general data protection regulation labor relations laws tax laws anticompetition regulations import and trade restrictions export requirements us laws such as the fcpa and other us federal laws and regulations established by the office of foreign asset control local laws such as the uk bribery act 2010 or other local laws which prohibit corrupt payments to governmental officials or certain payments or remunerations to customers 

given the high level of complexity of these laws there is a risk that we may inadvertently breach some provisions for example through fraudulent or negligent behavior of individual employees our failure to comply with certain formal documentation requirements or otherwise our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate these risks and manage these challenges through policies procedures and internal controls however we have a dispersed international sales organization and we use distributors and agents in many of our international operations this structure makes it more difficult for us to ensure that our international selling operations comply with our global policies and procedures 

violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines criminal sanctions against us our officers or our employees requirements to obtain export licenses cessation of business activities in sanctioned countries implementation of compliance programs and prohibitions on the conduct of our business violations of laws and regulations also could result in prohibitions on our ability to offer our products in one or more countries and could materially damage our reputation our brand our international expansion efforts our ability to attract and retain employees or our business results of operations and financial condition see also our risk factor regarding government regulations below 

the industries and market segments in which we operate are highly competitive and we may not be able to compete effectively 

the life science and clinical diagnostics markets are each highly competitive some of our competitors have merged and some of our competitors have greater financial resources than we do and are less leveraged than we are making them better equipped to license technologies and intellectual property from third parties or to fund research and development manufacturing and marketing efforts for more information about our competitors see “competition” in part 1 item 1 of this annual report moreover competitive and regulatory conditions in many markets in which we operate restrict our ability to fully recover through price increases higher costs of acquired goods and services resulting from inflation and other drivers of cost increases many public tenders have become more competitive due to governments lengthening the commitments of their public tenders to multiple years which reduce the number of tenders in which we can participate annually because the value of these multipleyear tenders is so high our competitors have been more aggressive with their pricing our failure to compete effectively andor pricing pressures resulting from competition could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

we may not be able to grow our business because of our failure to develop new or improved products 

our future growth depends in part on our ability to continue to improve our product offerings and develop and introduce new product lines and extensions that integrate technological advances in particular we may not be able to keep up with changes in the clinical diagnostics industry such as the trend toward molecular diagnostics or pointofcare tests if we are unable to integrate technological advances into our product offerings or to design develop 

manufacture and market new product lines and extensions successfully and in a timely manner our business results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected we have experienced product launch delays in the past and may do so in the future we cannot assure you that our product and process development efforts will be successful or that new products we introduce will achieve market acceptance failure to launch successful new products or improvements to existing products may cause our products to become obsolete which could harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

we are subject to foreign currency exchange fluctuations which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

as stated above a significant portion of our operations and sales are outside of the united states when we make purchases and sales in currencies other than the us dollars we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar that may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition our international sales are largely denominated in local currencies as a result the strengthening of the us dollar negatively impacts our consolidated net sales expressed in us dollars conversely when the us dollar weakens our expenses at our international sites increase in addition the volatility of other currencies such as the swiss franc brazilian real and russian ruble may negatively impact our operations outside of the united states and increase our costs to hedge against currency fluctuations we cannot assure you that future shifts in currency exchange rates will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition for further information regarding our foreign exchange risk see “foreign currency exchange gains and losses” in part ii item 7 and “foreign exchange risk” in part ii item 7a of this annual report 

we may experience difficulties implementing our new global enterprise resource planning system 

we are engaged in a multiyear implementation of a new global enterprise resource planning system erp the erp is designed to efficiently maintain our books and records and provide information important to the operation of our business to our management team the erp will continue to require significant investment of human and financial resources in implementing the erp we may experience significant delays increased costs and other difficulties any significant disruption or deficiency in the design and implementation of the erp could adversely affect our ability to process orders ship product send invoices and track payments fulfill contractual obligations or otherwise operate our business for example we experienced system implementation issues in our clinical diagnostics segment during our first deployment that impacted invoicing and caused an increase in accounts receivable in our second deployment which we launched in july 2015 we experienced delays in manufacturing and logistics which adversely impacted our sales we may experience similar and other issues with our upcoming third deployment in western europe which we expect to launch in april 2017 we anticipate that the third deployment will be more complex than our prior deployments due to its scope while we have invested significant resources in planning project management and training additional and significant implementation issues may arise in addition our efforts to centralize various business processes and functions within our organization in connection with our erp implementation may disrupt our operations and negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition 

recent and planned changes to our organizational structure and executive management team could negatively impact our business 

we made significant changes to our organizational structure in 2014 2015 and 2016 in 2014 and 2015 we functionalized our manufacturing and selling organizations globally and separated them from our marketing and research and development organizations specifically we combined our international selling organization with our north american selling divisions into one global selling group and consolidated our manufacturing procurement and logistics operations into one global supply chain group we also created new management positions to head each of these groups in addition we appointed new executives to head each of our life science and clinical diagnostics segments and we appointed a chief operating officer we also restructured our life science segment based on functional groups rather than product line divisions in 2016 we began implementing the reorganization of the structure of our european organization these changes may have unintended consequences such as 

distraction of our management and employees business disruption attrition of our workforce inability to attract or retain key employees and reduced employee morale or productivity 

our failure to establish and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could result in material misstatements in our financial statements our failure to meet our reporting obligations and cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information which in turn could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline 

maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to produce reliable financial statements as previously disclosed in connection with our assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements for the year ended december 31 2013 we identified a material weakness in the design of monitoring controls over operations at certain of our locations both within the united states and overseas as well as a lack of documentation required to operate these controls appropriately although we remediated this material weakness as of december 31 2014 we cannot assure you that additional material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting will not be identified in the future for example we previously identified different material weaknesses in internal controls at december 31 2012 and december 31 2010 both of which have been remediated 

such material weaknesses have adversely affected us in the past and could affect us in the future and the results of our periodic management evaluations and annual auditor attestation reports regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting required by section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 any failure to maintain new and more precise monitoring controls and improved detection and communication of financial misstatements across all levels of the organization could result in additional material weaknesses result in material misstatements in our financial statements and cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations this could cause us to lose public confidence and could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline for further information regarding our controls and procedures see part ii item 9a of this annual report 

breaches of our information systems could have material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

through our sales and ecommerce channels we collect and store confidential information that customers provide to among other things purchase products or services enroll in promotional programs and register on our web site we also acquire and retain information about suppliers and employees in the normal course of business we also create and maintain proprietary information that is critical to our business such as our product designs and manufacturing processes despite recent initiatives to improve our technology systems such as our enterprise resource planning implementation and the centralization of our global information technology organization we could experience a significant data security breach computer hackers may attempt to penetrate our or our vendors’ information systems and if successful misappropriate confidential customer supplier employee or other business information such as our intellectual property third parties could also gain control of our systems and use them for criminal purposes while appearing to be us as a result we could lose existing customers have difficulty attracting new customers be exposed to claims from customers financial institutions payment card associations employees and other persons have regulatory sanctions or penalties imposed incur additional expenses or lose revenues as a result of a data privacy breach or suffer other adverse consequences our operations and ability to process sales orders particularly through our ecommerce channels could also be disrupted any significant breakdown intrusion interruption corruption or destruction of our systems as well as any data breaches could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations see also our risk factors regarding our erp implementation above and our information technology systems below 

risks relating to intellectual property rights may negatively impact our business 

we rely on a combination of copyright trade secret patent and trademark laws and thirdparty nondisclosure agreements to protect our intellectual property rights and products however we cannot assure you that our intellectual property rights will not be challenged invalidated circumvented or rendered unenforceable or that meaningful protection or adequate remedies will be available to us for instance unauthorized third parties have 

attempted to copy our intellectual property reverse engineer or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary or have developed equivalent technologies independently and may do so in the future additionally third parties have asserted patent copyright and other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to us and may do so in the future if we are unable to license or otherwise access protected technology used in our products or if we lose our rights under any existing licenses we could be prohibited from manufacturing and marketing such products from time to time we also must enforce our patents or other intellectual property rights or defend ourselves against claimed infringement of the rights of others through litigation as a result we could incur substantial costs be forced to redesign our products or be required to pay damages to an infringed party any of the foregoing matters could adversely impact our business results of operations and financial condition 

global economic conditions could continue to adversely affect our operations 

in recent years we have been faced with very challenging global economic conditions further deterioration in the global economic environment may result in decreased demand for our products increased competition downward pressure on the prices for our products and longer sales cycles a weakening of macroeconomic conditions may also adversely affect our suppliers which could result in interruptions in supply in the future we have also experienced delays in collecting receivables in certain countries in western europe and we may experience similar delays in these and other countries or regions experiencing liquidity problems as of december 31 2016  we had accounts receivable net of allowance for doubtful accounts in spain italy greece and portugal of 327 million  in addition a slowing of growth in the chinese economy and in emerging markets especially those oilproducing countries that have been affected by the decline in oil prices could adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition we also are monitoring developments following the recent referendum in the united kingdom to leave the european union to determine if there will be any potential impact on our business 

reductions in government funding and the capital spending programs of our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

our customers include universities clinical diagnostics laboratories government agencies hospitals and pharmaceutical biotechnology and chemical companies the capital spending programs of these institutions and companies have a significant effect on the demand for our products such programs are based on a wide variety of factors including the resources available to make such purchases the availability of funding from grants by governments or government agencies the spending priorities for various types of equipment and the policies regarding capital expenditures during industry downturns or recessionary periods if government funding to our customers were to decrease or if our customers were to decrease or reallocate their budgets in a manner adverse to us our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected for more information on our customers see sales and marketing in part i item 1 of this annual report 

changes in the healthcare industry could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

there have been and will continue to be significant changes in the healthcare industry in an effort to reduce costs these changes include 

 

 

 

to the extent that the healthcare industry seeks to address the need to contain costs stemming from reform measures such as those contained in the ppaca and the protecting access to medicare act of 2014 or in future legislation by limiting the number of clinical tests being performed or the amount of reimbursement available for such tests our business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected if these changes in the healthcare markets in the united states and europe continue we could be forced to alter our approach in selling marketing distributing and servicing our products 

we are subject to substantial government regulation and any changes in regulation or violations of regulations by us could adversely affect our business prospects results of operations or financial condition 

some of our products primarily our clinical diagnostic products production processes and marketing are subject to us federal state and local and foreign regulation including by the fda in the united states and its foreign counterparts the fda regulates our clinical diagnostic products as medical devices and we are subject to significant regulatory clearances or approvals to market our clinical diagnostic products and other requirements including for example recordkeeping and reporting requirements such as the fda’s medical device reporting regulations and reporting of corrections and removals the fda has broad regulatory and enforcement powers if the fda determines that we have failed to comply with applicable regulatory requirements it can impose a variety of enforcement actions ranging from public warning letters fines injunctions consent decrees and civil penalties to suspension or delayed issuance of approvals seizure or recall of our products total or partial shutdown of production withdrawal of approvals or clearances already granted and criminal prosecution 

the fda can also require us to repair replace or refund the cost of devices that we manufactured or distributed 

in addition the fda may change its clearance and approval policies adopt additional regulations or revise existing regulations or take other actions which may prevent or delay approval or clearance of our products or impact our ability to modify our currently approved or cleared products on a timely basis changes in the fda’s review of certain clinical diagnostic products referred to as laboratory developed tests which are tests developed by a single laboratory for use only in that laboratory could affect some of our customers who use our life science instruments for laboratory developed tests in the past the fda has chosen to not enforce applicable regulations and has not reviewed such tests for approval however the fda has issued draft guidance that it may begin enforcing its medical device requirements including premarket submission requirements to such tests any delay in or failure to receive or maintain clearance or approval for our products could prevent us from generating revenue from these products and adversely affect our business operations and financial results additionally the fda and other regulatory authorities have broad enforcement powers regulatory enforcement or inquiries or other increased 

scrutiny on us could affect the perceived safety and efficacy of our products and dissuade our customers from using our products 

many foreign governments have similar rules and regulations regarding the importation registration labeling sale and use of our products such agencies may also impose new requirements that may require us to modify or reregister products already on the market or otherwise impact our ability to market our products in those countries for example europe published draft regulations in june 2016 that include broad changes to its regulations regarding in vitro diagnostic devices and medical devices including stricter product labeling requirements russia has recently enacted more stringent medical product registration and labeling regulations china has enacted stricter labeling requirements and we expect other countries such as brazil and india to impose more regulations that impact our product registrations due to these evolving and diverse requirements we face uncertain product approval timelines additional time and effort to comply reduced sales and potential fines for noncompliance increasing protectionism in such countries also impedes our ability to compete with local companies for example we may not be able to participate in certain public tenders in russia because of increasing measures to restrict access to such tenders for companies without local manufacturing capabilities specifically a resolution passed by russia in february 2015 prohibited the procurement of certain types of medical devices by russian state entities from foreign companies provided there are a sufficient number of russian manufacturers submitting tenders in december 2016 russia continued its focus on import substitution by passing a resolution that added to the list of certain medical devices which participate in state procurement on a restricted basis such regulations could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

we are also subject to government regulation of the use and handling of a number of materials and controlled substances the us drug enforcement administration establishes registration security recordkeeping reporting storage distribution and other requirements for controlled substances pursuant to the controlled substances act of 1970 failure to comply with present or future laws and regulations could result in substantial liability to us suspension or cessation of our operations restrictions on our ability to expand at our present locations or require us to make significant capital expenditures or incur other significant expenses 

we cannot assure you that we will be able to integrate acquired companies products or technologies into our company successfully or we may not be able to realize the anticipated benefits from the acquisitions 

as part of our overall business strategy we pursue acquisitions of and investments in complementary companies products and technologies in order to be successful in these activities we must among other things 

 

the benefits of any acquisition may prove to be less than anticipated and may not outweigh the costs reported in our financial statements completing any potential future acquisitions could cause significant diversion of our management’s time and resources if we acquire new companies products or technologies we may be required to assume contingent liabilities or record impairment charges for goodwill and other intangible assets over time we cannot assure you that we will successfully overcome these risks or any other problems we encounter in connection with any acquisitions and any such acquisitions could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

product quality and liability issues could harm our reputation and negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition 

we must adequately address quality issues associated with our products including defects in our engineering design and manufacturing processes as well as defects in thirdparty components included in our products our instruments reagents and consumables are complex and identifying the root cause of quality issues especially those affecting reagents or thirdparty components is difficult we may incur significant costs and expend substantial time in researching and remediating such issues quality issues could also delay our launching or manufacturing of new products in addition quality issues unapproved uses of our products or inadequate disclosure of risks related to our products could result in product recalls or product liability or other claims being brought against us these issues could harm our reputation impair our relationship with existing customers and harm our ability to attract new customers which could negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition 

lack of key personnel could hurt our business 

our products are very technical in nature in general only highly qualified and welltrained scientists have the necessary skills to develop market and sell our products and many of our manufacturing positions require very specialized knowledge and skills in addition the global nature of our business also requires that we have sophisticated and experienced staff to comply with increasingly complex international laws and regulations we face intense competition for these professionals from our competitors customers marketing partners and other companies throughout our industry in particular the job market in northern california where many of our employees are located is very competitive if we do not offer competitive compensation and benefits we may fail to retain or attract a sufficient number of qualified personnel which could impair our ability to properly run our business 

in some cases we rely on temporary personnel or consultants and we may do so in the future such temporary personnel or consultants may lack the knowledge andor specific skills necessary for our business require time to train without benefiting us through extended employment and increase our costs in addition as noted above our strategic initiatives such as our internal restructuring and erp implementation may be burdensome and disruptive and lead to employee dissatisfaction and attrition 

a reduction or interruption in the supply of components and raw materials could adversely affect our manufacturing operations and related product sales 

the manufacture of many of our products requires the timely delivery of sufficient amounts of quality components and materials we manufacture our products in numerous manufacturing facilities around the world we acquire our components and materials from many suppliers in various countries we work closely with our suppliers to ensure the continuity of supply but we cannot guarantee these efforts will always be successful further while we seek to diversify our sources of components and materials in certain instances we acquire components and materials from a sole supplier in addition due to the regulatory environment in which we operate we may be unable to quickly establish additional or replacement sources for some components or materials if our supply is reduced or interrupted or of poor quality and we are unable to develop alternative sources for such supply our ability to manufacture our products in a timely or costeffective manner could be adversely affected which would adversely affect our ability to sell our products 

if our information technology systems are disrupted or if we fail to successfully implement manage and integrate our information technology and reporting systems our business results of operations and financial condition could be harmed 

our information technology it systems are an integral part of our business and a serious disruption of our it systems could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition we depend on our it systems to process orders manage inventory and collect accounts receivable our it systems also allow us to efficiently purchase products from our suppliers and ship products to our customers on a timely basis 

maintain costeffective operations and provide customer service we may experience disruption of our it systems due to redundancy issues with our network servers we cannot assure you that our contingency plans will allow us to operate at our current level of efficiency 

our ability to implement our business plan in a rapidly evolving market requires effective planning reporting and analytical processes we expect that we will need to continue to improve and further integrate our it systems reporting systems and operating procedures by training and educating our employees with respect to these improvements and integrations on an ongoing basis in order to effectively run our business we may suffer interruptions in service loss of data or reduced functionality when we upgrade or change systems if we fail to successfully manage and integrate our it systems reporting systems and operating procedures it could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition see also our risk factors regarding our erp implementation and data security above and events beyond our control below 

natural disasters terrorist attacks acts of war or other events beyond our control may cause damage or disruption to us and our employees facilities information systems security systems vendors and customers which could significantly impact our business results of operations and financial condition 

we have significant manufacturing and distribution facilities including in the western united states france switzerland germany and singapore in particular the western united states has experienced a number of earthquakes wildfires floods landslides and other natural disasters in recent years these occurrences could damage or destroy our facilities which may result in interruptions to our business and losses that exceed our insurance coverage in addition strikes or other labor unrest at any of our sites or surrounding areas could cause disruption to our business 

acts of terrorism bioterrorism violence or war could also affect the markets in which we operate our business operations and strategic plans political unrest may affect our sales in certain regions such as in southeast asia the middle east and eastern europe in particular the political turmoil in ukraine along with the response of the russian and us governments to this situation has the potential to impact our operations in russia any of these events could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

environmental health and safety regulations and enforcement proceedings may negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition 

our operations are subject to federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations that govern such activities as transportation of goods emissions to air and discharges to water as well as handling and disposal practices for solid hazardous and medical wastes in addition to environmental laws that regulate our operations we are also subject to environmental laws and regulations that create liability and cleanup responsibility for spills disposals or other releases of hazardous substances into the environment as a result of our operations or otherwise impacting real property that we own or operate the environmental laws and regulations also subject us to claims by third parties for damages resulting from any spills disposals or releases resulting from our operations or at any of our properties we must also comply with various health and safety regulations in the united states and abroad in connection with our operations 

we may in the future incur capital and operating costs to comply with currently existing laws and regulations and possible new statutory enactments and these expenditures may be significant we have incurred and may in the future incur fines related to environmental matters andor liability for costs or damages related to spills or other releases of hazardous substances into the environment at sites where we have operated or at offsite locations where we have sent hazardous substances for disposal we cannot assure you however that such matters or any future obligations to comply with environmental or health and safety laws and regulations will not adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

we may be subject to additional tax liabilities 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and many foreign jurisdictions we calculate our provision for income taxes in each jurisdiction in which we operate significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and in the ordinary course of business there are many tax positions taken where the ultimate resolution is uncertain we are subject to the examination of our tax positions in the united states and foreign jurisdictions taxing authorities have disagreed with our judgment in the past and may disagree with positions we take in the future resulting in assessments of additional taxes economic and political pressures to increase tax revenues in various jurisdictions may make resolving tax disputes more difficult for example in recent years the tax authorities in europe have disagreed with our tax positions related to hybrid debt research and development credits transfer pricing and indirect taxes among others we regularly assess the likelihood of the outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals the results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements in the period or periods for which that determination is made changes in factors outside of our control such as changes in tax laws or rates changes in the interpretation of tax laws or changes in the jurisdictional mix of our earnings could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations 

our debt may restrict our future operations 

we have substantial debt and have the ability to incur additional debt as of december 31 2016  we had approximately 4345 million of outstanding indebtedness in addition we have a revolving credit facility that provides for up to 2000 million  08 million of which has been utilized for domestic standby letters of credit our incurrence of substantial amounts of debt may have important consequences for instance it could 

 

our existing credit facility and the terms of our other debt instruments including agreements we may enter in the future contain or will contain covenants imposing significant restrictions on our business these restrictions may affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise these covenants place restrictions on our ability to among other things incur additional debt acquire other businesses or assets through merger or purchase create liens make investments enter into transactions with affiliates sell assets in the case of some of our subsidiaries guarantee debt and declare or pay dividends redeem stock or make other distributions to stockholders our existing credit facility also requires that we comply with certain financial ratios including a maximum consolidated leverage ratio test and a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio test 

our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control including prevailing economic financial and industry conditions the breach of any of these restrictions could result in a default an event of default under our debt agreements would permit some of our lenders to declare all amounts borrowed from them to be due and payable together with accrued and unpaid interest in addition acceleration of our other indebtedness may cause us to be unable to make interest payments on our outstanding notes and repay the principal 

amount of our outstanding notes or may cause the future subsidiary guarantors if any to be unable to make payments under the guarantees 

we are subject to healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations and could face substantial penalties if we are unable to fully comply with such laws 

we are subject to healthcare fraud and abuse regulation and enforcement by both the us federal government and the us states and foreign governments in which we conduct our business these healthcare laws and regulations include for example 

 

 

 

 

 

these laws will continue to impose administrative cost and compliance burdens on us the shifting compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust systems to comply with multiple jurisdictions with different compliance andor reporting requirements increases the possibility that a healthcare company may violate one or more of these requirements in addition any action against us for violation of these laws even if we successfully defend against it could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business if our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us we may be subject to penalties including civil and criminal penalties damages fines exclusion from the medicare and medicaid programs and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business results of operations and financial condition 

we may incur losses in future periods due to writedowns in the value of financial instruments 

we have positions in a variety of financial instruments including asset backed securities and other similar instruments financial markets are quite volatile and the markets for these securities can be illiquid the value of these securities will continue to be impacted by external market factors including default rates changes in the value of the underlying property such as residential or commercial real estate rating agency actions the prices at which observable market transactions occur and the financial strength of various entities such as financial guarantors who provide insurance for the securities should we need to convert these positions to cash we may not be able to sell these instruments without significant losses due to current debtor financial conditions or other market considerations 

regulations related to “conflict minerals” could adversely impact our business 

as part of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the sec adopted disclosure requirements regarding the use of certain minerals known as conflict minerals which are mined from the democratic republic of congo drc and adjoining countries as well as procedures regarding a manufacturers efforts to identify the sourcing of such minerals and metals produced from those minerals in november 2016 the eu institutions agreed on the text of a conflict minerals regulation after formal approval by the european parliament and european council the regulation will be published and enter into force 20 days later we have incurred and will continue to incur additional costs in order to comply with the sec’s disclosure requirements in addition we might incur further costs due to possible changes to our products processes or sources of supply as a consequence of our due diligence activities as our supply chain is complex we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins of the specified minerals used in our products through our due diligence procedures which may harm our reputation in addition we may encounter challenges to satisfy those customers who require that all of the components of our products be certified as “drc conflict free” which could place us at a competitive disadvantage if we do not do so we filed our report for the calendar year 2015 with the sec on may 27 2016 

risks related to our common stock 

  

a significant majority of our voting stock is held by the schwartz family which could lead to conflicts of interest 

we have two classes of voting stock class a common stock and class b common stock with a few exceptions holders of class a and class b common stock vote as a single class when voting as a single class each share of class a common stock is entitled to onetenth of a vote while each share of class b common stock has one vote in the election or removal of directors the classes vote separately and the holders of class a common stock are entitled to elect 25 of the board of directors with holders of class b common stock electing the remaining directors 

as a result of the schwartz familys ownership of our class a and class b common stock they are able to elect a majority of our directors effect fundamental changes in our direction and control matters affecting us including the determination of business opportunities that may be suitable for our company the schwartz family may exercise its control over us according to interests that are different from other investors’ or debtors’ interests in particular this concentration of ownership and voting power may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

this discussion should be read in conjunction with the information contained in our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes which are an integral part of the statements 

overview  we are a multinational manufacturer and worldwide distributor of our own life science research and clinical diagnostics products our business is organized into two primary segments life science and clinical diagnostics with the mission to provide scientists with specialized products needed for biological research and clinical diagnostics 

we sell more than 8000 products and services to a diverse client base comprised of scientific research healthcare education and government customers worldwide we do not disclose quantitative information about our different products and services as it is impractical to do so based primarily on the numerous products and services that we sell and the global markets that we serve 

we manufacture and supply our customers with a range of reagents apparatus and equipment to separate complex chemical and biological materials and to identify analyze and purify components because our customers require standardization for their experiments and test results much of our revenues are recurring 

we are impacted by the support of many governments for both research and healthcare the current global economic outlook is still uncertain as the need to control government social spending by many governments limits 

opportunities for growth adding to this uncertainty was the recent referendum in the united kingdom to withdraw from the european union and a change in the us executive branch of government approximately 37 of our 2016 consolidated net sales are derived from the united states and approximately 63 are derived from international locations with europe being our largest international region the international sales are largely denominated in local currencies such as the euro swiss franc japanese yen chinese yuan and british sterling as a result our consolidated net sales expressed in dollars benefit when the us dollar weakens and suffer when the dollar strengthens when the us dollar strengthens we benefit from lower cost of sales from our own international manufacturing sites as well as nonus suppliers and from lower international operating expenses we regularly discuss our changes in revenue and expense categories in terms of both changing foreign exchange rates and in terms of a currency neutral basis if notable to explain the impact currency has on our results 

on february 15 2017 we acquired all the issued and outstanding stock of raindance technologies inc raindance for approximately 87 million including certain assumed net liabilities cash payments at closing were 829 million the acquisition will be included in our life science segment’s results of operations from the acquisition date and will be accounted for as a business combination raindances foundational intellectual property portfolio and product lines encompass a wide range of biological reactions in droplets with potential applications in life science research and clinical research these genomic tools provide ultrasensitive detection of genetic variations in cancer as well as inherited and infectious diseases enabling research in areas such as noninvasive liquid biopsy we believe that raindances dropletbased solutions will extend our reach into nextgeneration sequencing applications and strengthen our position in the area of droplet digital™ pcr offering customers with solutions for a wide range of nucleic acid detection applications see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements 

during the fourth quarter of 2016 we fully impaired goodwill and inprocess research and development in the amounts of 135 million and 464 million respectively associated with our 2014 acquisition of gnubio inc 

in may 2016 we announced the elimination or relocation of various positions as part of restructuring plans approved by management in connection with this announcement for the year ended december 31 2016  we recorded 125 million in restructuring charges related to severance and other employee benefits of which 90 million is anticipated to be paid through 2019 these restructuring actions are primarily intended to reduce eliminate or relocate our global workforce in order to better align expenses to our revenue and gross margin profile and position us for improved operating performance these actions are aligned with the creation and evolution of our organization structure and coordinated with the implementation of our single instance erp platform in the future we may take additional restructuring actions to gain operating efficiencies or reduce our operating expenses while simultaneously implementing additional cost containment measures and expense control programs such restructuring actions are subject to significant risks including delays in implementing expense control programs or workforce reductions and the failure to meet operational targets due to the loss of employees or a decrease in employee morale any of which would impair our ability to achieve anticipated cost reductions if we do not achieve the anticipated cost reductions our business could be harmed see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements 

in january 2016 we acquired a high performance analytical flow cytometer platform from propel labs propel that will enable advanced and novice users to perform basic and multiparameter cytometry for a wide range of applications and chemistries this asset acquisition was accounted for as a business combination and is included in our life science segments results of operations from the acquisition date the fair values of the net assets acquired from propel as of the acquisition date were determined to be 327 million of definitelived intangible assets and 01 million of goodwill after the effects of a calculation revision that were reflected in the fourth quarter of 2016 this revision reduced goodwillintangibles and contingent consideration by the same amount and had no significant impact on our consolidated income statement 

the fair value of the consideration as of the acquisition date was 328 million as revised which included 95 million paid in cash at the closing date and 233 million in contingent consideration potentially payable to propel the contingent consideration was based on a probabilityweighted income approach related to the achievement of 

sales milestones ranging from 39 to 20 for the calendar years 2017 through 2020  the sales milestones could potentially range from 0 to an unlimited amount through december 31 2020  the contingent consideration was recognized at its estimated fair value of 254 million as of december 31 2016  

as previously disclosed in may 2010 we voluntarily disclosed to the us department of justice doj and the securities and exchange commission sec certain likely or potential violations of the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa effective november 3 2014 we entered into a nonprosecution agreement npa with the doj and consented to the entry of an order by the sec sec order which actions resolve both the doj and sec investigations as a result of the settlements with the doj and the sec during the fourth quarter of 2014 we paid a total of 551 million that included a penalty of 144 million 351 million in disgorgement and 56 million in interest on october 28 2016 the doj and sec informed biorad that they did not intend to extend the npa after it expired on november 2 2016 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the accompanying discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities and contingencies as of the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis we base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources however future events may cause us to change our assumptions and estimates which may require adjustment actual results could differ from these estimates we have determined that for the periods reported in this annual report on form 10k the following accounting policies and estimates are critical in understanding our financial condition and results of operations 

accounting for income taxes management is required to make estimates related to our income tax provision in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate this process involves estimating our current tax exposures as well as making judgments regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets in each jurisdiction deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect the tax effects of losses credits and temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes management assesses the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent management believes that recovery is not likely a valuation allowance must be established to the extent management establishes a valuation allowance or increases this allowance in a period an increase to expense within the provision for income taxes in the consolidated statements of income may result 

we have recorded a valuation allowance of 664 million and 583 million as of december 31 2016 and 2015  respectively due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize some of the deferred tax assets primarily consisting of certain foreign net operating losses carried forward the valuation allowance is based on management’s current estimates of taxable income for the jurisdictions in which we operate and the period over which the deferred tax assets will be recoverable in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or these estimates are adjusted in future periods an additional valuation allowance may need to be established which would increase the tax provision lowering income and impacting our financial position should realization of these deferred tax assets for which a valuation allowance has been provided occur the provision for income taxes may decrease raising income and positively impacting biorad’s financial position 

we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements on a particular tax position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon settlement the amount of unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted as appropriate for changes in facts and circumstances such as significant amendments to existing tax 

law new regulations or interpretations by the taxing authorities new information obtained during a tax examination or resolution of an examination we recognize both accrued interest and penalties where appropriate related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense our overall effective tax rate is subject to fluctuations because of changes in the geographic mix of earnings changes to statutory tax rates and tax laws and because of the impact of various tax audits and assessments as well as generation of tax credits 

valuation of goodwill and longlived assets goodwill represents the excess of the cost over the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses goodwill amounts are assigned to reporting units at the time of acquisition and are adjusted for any subsequent significant transfers of business between reporting units we assess the impairment of goodwill annually in the fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable we perform the impairment tests of goodwill at our reporting unit level which is one level below our operating segments the goodwill impairment test consists of a twostep process the first step of the goodwill impairment test used to identify potential impairment compares the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is not required the second step if required compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill the fair value of a reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the price paid to acquire the reporting unit if the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill exceeds its implied fair value an impairment charge is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 

we use a projected discounted cash flow model to determine the fair value of a reporting unit this discounted cash flow method for determining goodwill may be different from the fair value that would result from an actual transaction between a willing buyer and a willing seller projections such as discounted cash flow models are inherently uncertain and accordingly actual future cash flows may differ materially from projected cash flows management judgment is required in developing the assumptions for the discounted cash flow model these assumptions include revenue growth rates profit margins future capital expenditures working capital needs expected foreign currency rates discount rates and terminal values we estimate future cash flows using current and longerterm financial forecasts these forecasts take into account the current economic environment the discount rates used are compiled using independent sources current trends in similar businesses and other observable market data changes to these rates might result in material changes in the valuation and determination of the recoverability of goodwill for example an increase in the discount rate used to discount cash flows will decrease the computed fair value 

impairment tests are highly sensitive to changes in assumptions and minor changes to assumptions that could result in impairment losses our forecasts utilized in our 2016 impairment test assumed among other things sales growth from executing our sales and marketing programs new product introductions successful product development and timely registration of our products when required while controlling costs in addition external factors such as currency inflation rates and cost of capital could affect the determination of fair value of our reporting units aside from our gnubio inc reporting unit which reflected a carrying value that exceeded its fair value our impairment tests resulted in excessive fair value over book value ranging from 22 to more than 400 for our various reporting units if the initiatives mentioned above do not achieve the desired results or external factors change detrimentally future impairment losses may occur 

to validate the reasonableness of the reporting unit fair values we reconcile the aggregate fair values of the reporting units to the enterprise market capitalization in performing the reconciliation we may depending on the volatility of the market value of our stock price use either the stock price on the valuation date or the average stock price over a range of dates around the valuation date 

for purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment loss a longlived asset or assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities we assess the impairment of longlived assets including identifiable 

intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable factors that we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include 

 

when management determines that the carrying value of longlived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment we test for any impairment based on a projected undiscounted cash flow method projected future operating results and cash flows of the asset or asset group are used to establish the fair value used in evaluating the carrying value of longlived and intangible assets we estimate the future cash flows of the longlived assets using current and longterm financial forecasts the carrying amount of a longlived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset if this is the case an impairment loss would be recognized the impairment loss recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value in 2016 we fully impaired goodwill and inprocess research and development in the amounts of 135 million and 464 million respectively associated with our 2014 acquisition of gnubio inc the impairments were based upon a revision of our level 3 valuation inputs ie expected future cash flows also in 2016 we impaired intellectual property in the amount of 24 million associated with the termination of a research and development project there were no impairment losses recorded in 2015 in 2014 we impaired licenses of a discontinued product line in the amount of 64 million  this impairment charge included 58 million in cost of goods sold and 06 million in research and development expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of income 

we early adopted asu 201704 simplifying the test for goodwill impairment on january 1 2017 which removes step 2 of the goodwill impairment test for any impairments after january 1 2017 see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements 

valuation of inventories we value inventory at the lower of the actual cost to purchase andor manufacture the inventory or the current estimated net realizable value of the inventory we review inventory quantities on hand and reduce the cost basis of excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on an estimated forecast of product demand production requirements and the quality efficacy and potency of raw materials this review is done on a quarterly basis or if warranted by the circumstances more frequently in addition our industry is characterized by technological change frequent new product development and product obsolescence that could result in an increase in the amount of obsolete inventory quantities on hand our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate and if too high we may have overstated the carrying value of our inventory in the future if inventory is determined to be overvalued we would be required to write down the value of inventory to market and recognize such costs in our cost of goods sold at the time of such determination therefore although we make efforts to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand and perform procedures to safeguard overall inventory quality any significant unanticipated changes in demand technological developments regulations storage conditions or other economic or environmental factors affecting biological materials could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and reported results of operations 

we adopted asu 201511 simplifying the measurement of inventory on january 1 2017 which requires inventory measurement at the lower of cost and net realizable value see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements 

valuation of investments we regularly review our investments for factors that may indicate that a decline in the fair value of an investment below its carrying value is otherthantemporary some factors considered in evaluating whether or not a decline in fair value is otherthantemporary include our ability and intent to retain the investment 

for a period of time sufficient to allow for a recovery in value the duration and extent to which the fair value has been less than cost and the financial condition and prospects of the issuer such reviews are inherently uncertain in that the value of the investment may not fully recover or may decline further in future periods resulting in realized losses 

warranty reserves we warrant certain equipment against defects in design materials and workmanship generally for a period of one year upon delivery and on acceptance of that equipment we establish as part of cost of goods sold a provision for the expected costs of such warranty repairs based on historical experience specific warranty terms and customer feedback a review is performed on a quarterly basis to assess the adequacy of our warranty reserve and it is adjusted if necessary the warranty reserve is based on actual experience and expected future costs to be incurred should realized costs be higher than expected costs cost of goods sold would be lower in the period of estimation and higher when realized 

allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the collectability of our customer accounts the amount of the allowance is determined by analyzing known uncollectible accounts the age of our receivables economic conditions in the customers’ country or industry historical losses and our customers’ general creditworthiness amounts later determined and specifically identified to be uncollectible are charged or written off against this allowance uncertainty in the current economic environment if prolonged could result in greater amounts becoming uncollectible in the future should the estimates of losses be higher than the actual uncollectible accounts we would report lower profitability when the estimates are made and higher profitability when the receivable is collected 

litigation accruals we record as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets estimated amounts for claims that are probable and can be reasonably estimated the likelihood of a material change in these estimated liabilities is dependent on the possible outcome of settlement negotiations regulatory or judicial review and the development of facts and circumstances in extended litigation which could change claims or assessments when both the amount and range of loss on some outstanding litigation is uncertain we disclose in the footnotes of the financial statements when we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of a material liability that could result from unfavorable outcomes in litigation as events occur we will assess the potential liability related to our pending litigation and revise our estimates such revisions could materially impact our results of operations 

results of operations  sales gross margins and expenses 

the following shows cost of goods sold gross profit expense items and net income as a percentage of net sales 



net sales 

n et sales sales in 2016 were 207 billion  an increase of 24 compared to 202 billion in 2015  excluding the impact of foreign currency 2016 sales increased by approximately 40 compared to 2015  currency neutral sales growth was primarily reflected in all regions except europe 

the life science segment sales in 2016 were 7307 million  an increase of 51 compared to 2015  on a currency neutral basis sales increased 65 compared to 2015  the currency neutral sales increase was primarily in our droplet digital™ pcr and process media products the currency neutral sales increase was in all regions 

the clinical diagnostics segment sales in 2016 were 132 billion  an increase of 10 compared to 2015  on a currency neutral basis sales increased 26 compared to 2015  the currency neutral sales increase was primarily attributable to growth in quality control immunology blood typing and diabetes product lines on a geographic view currency neutral sales in 2016 increased most notably in the americas and asia while sales declined in europe 

sales in 2015 were 202 billion a decrease of 72 compared to 218 billion in 2014 excluding the impact of foreign currency 2015 sales increased by approximately 16 compared to 2014 currency neutral sales growth was primarily reflected in the united states and china 

the life science segment sales in 2015 were 6950 million a decrease of 46 compared to 2014 on a currency neutral basis sales increased 25 compared to 2014 the currency neutral sales increase was primarily in our droplet digital™ pcr western blotting process chromatography media and cell biology products the currency neutral sales increase was primarily in the united states and europe partially offset by lower sales in asia excluding china 

the clinical diagnostics segment sales in 2015 were 131 billion a decrease of 85 compared to 2014 on a currency neutral basis sales increased 11 compared to 2014 the clinical diagnostics segment had currency neutral sales growth from quality controls and immunology products partially offset by declines in blood typing and infectious disease products currency neutral sales growth was primarily in north america china and latin america while european markets were still experiencing consolidation and pricing pressures 

gross margin 

consolidated gross margins were 550 in 2016 compared to 555 in 2015  life science segment gross margins in 2016 decreased from 2015 by approximately 07 percentage points  primarily due to lower margins in protein quantification and cell biology higher service costs higher acquisition intangible amortization and 07 million of restructuring costs partially offset by higher margins in droplet digital™ pcr process media products and antibody products clinical diagnostics segment gross margins in 2016 decreased from 2015 by approximately 

05 percentage points  the decrease compared to 2015 was primarily driven by sales mix and pricing pressures along with higher period expenses and 14 million of restructuring costs partially offset by the suspension of the medical device tax 

beginning in 2013 the patient protection and affordable care act as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act ppaca among other initiatives provided for a 23 annual excise tax on the sales of certain medical devices in the us biorad has been paying this excise tax on most of our us clinical diagnostic sales which we accounted for as a period cost in cost of goods sold however the consolidated appropriations act 2016 pub l 114113 signed into law on december 18 2015 includes a two year moratorium on the medical device excise tax during the period beginning on january 1 2016 and ending on december 31 2017 

consolidated gross margins were 555 in 2015 compared to 542 in 2014 life science segment gross margins in 2015 increased from 2014 by approximately 09 percentage points primarily due to sales of higher gross margin products including droplet digital™ pcr gene expression and cell biology products in addition lower service costs in europe and costs associated with the closing of a manufacturing plant in 2014 contributed to higher margins clinical diagnostics segment gross margins in 2015 increased from 2014 by approximately 

18 percentage points the increase compared to 2014 was primarily due to the 2014 consolidation and closure of certain facilities and the discontinuation of an underperforming product line sales mix also contributed to the higher gross margins in 2015 

selling general and administrative expense 

consolidated selling general and administrative expenses sga increased to 8167 million or 395 of sales in 2016 compared to 7620 million or 377 of sales in 2015  increases to sga primarily included employeerelated expenses our largest cost which also included 104 million of restructuring costs 210 million for various legal matters including the wadler judgment as discussed further in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements professional fees software the revaluation of contingent consideration primarily associated with the cell sorting system and to a lesser extent the analytical flow cytometer platform travel facilities and recruitmentrelocation decreases to sga primarily included bad debt expense and a onetime distributor cost in 2015 

consolidated sga decreased to 7620 million or 377 of sales in 2015 compared to 8082 million or 372 of sales in 2014 underlying the overall decrease in sga was the impact of foreign currency an accrual of 195 million in 2014 associated with the sec and doj investigations relating to the fcpa investigation for which a final settlement was reached in the fourth quarter of 2014 and a reduction of 42 million from the revaluations of contingent consideration currency neutral increases in sga were primarily employeerelated expenses our largest cost facilities and professional fees partially offset by travel other increases in sga included 23 million of bad debt expense and a onetime distributor termination cost of 19 million 

research and development expense 

research and development expense increased to 2059 million or 100 of sales in 2016 compared to 1930 million or 96 of sales in 2015  life science segment research and development expense increased in 2016 from 2015 primarily due to increased project activities in droplet digital™ pcr protein quantification and cell biology clinical diagnostics segment research and development expense increased in 2016 from 2015 primarily from increased spending associated with the gnubio business 

research and development expense decreased to 1930 million or 96 of sales in 2015 compared to 2203 million or 101 of sales in 2014 life science segment research and development expense decreased in 2015 from 2014 primarily due to headcount reductions lower supplies and lower external product development spend clinical diagnostics segment research and development expense decreased in 2015 from 2014 primarily due to the wind down of spending on projects as they approach launch and the discontinuation of an underperforming product line in 2014 

results of operations – nonoperating 

interest expense 

interest expense in 2016 increased 12 to 219 million  relatively flat compared to 217 million in 2015  

interest expense in 2015 decreased 20 to 217 million compared to 2014 primarily due to 06 million in 2014 associated with our offer to settle the sec and doj investigations relating to the fcpa investigation for which a final settlement was reached in the fourth quarter of 2014 

  

foreign currency exchange gains and losses 

foreign currency exchange gains and losses consist of foreign currency transaction gains and losses on intercompany net receivables and payables and the change in fair value of our forward foreign exchange contracts used to manage our foreign currency exchange risk net foreign currency exchange losses for 2016  2015 and 2014 were 45 million  102 million and 93 million  respectively the 2016  2015 and 2014 net foreign currency exchange losses were attributable to market volatility increasing costs to hedge and the result of the estimating process inherent in the timing of shipments and payments of intercompany debt and our decision to reclassify a large percentage of our intercompany receivable from brazil to longterm towards the end of 2015 all years are affected by the economic hedging program we employ to hedge our intercompany receivables and payables 

other income and expense net 

other income and expense net includes investment and dividend income generally interest income on our cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and long term marketable securities other income expense net in 2016 increased to 149 million income compared to 111 million income in 2015  the increase was primarily due to higher dividend income in 2016 on the ordinary and preferred shares of our investment in sartorius ag and higher investment income 

other income expense net in 2015 decreased to 111 million income compared to 130 million income in 2014 the decrease was primarily due to lower interest and investment income primarily related to a weaker 2015 foreign currency exchange rate for ordinary and preferred dividends from our investment in sartorius ag and realized losses in 2015 compared to no realized losses in 2014 

effective tax rate 

our effective tax rate was 32  22 and 32 in 2016  2015 and 2014  respectively the effective tax rates for 2016 and 2015 included tax benefits from the repatriation of foreign earnings the effective tax rate for 2016 included additional tax liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits related to the nondeductibility of interest expense in our foreign jurisdictions the effective tax rate for 2014 included nondeductible penalties and losses that were nonrecurring our foreign taxes result primarily from income earned in france and switzerland many jurisdictions in which we operate including switzerland russia the uk and singapore have statutory tax rates that are significantly lower than the us statutory tax rate of 35  our effective tax rate may be impacted in the future either favorably or unfavorably by many factors including but not limited to changes to statutory tax rates changes in tax laws or regulations tax audits and settlements and generation of tax credits 

our income tax returns are audited by us federal state and foreign tax authorities we are currently under examination by many of these tax authorities the tax years open to examination include the years 2013 and forward for the us and the years 2010 and forward for certain foreign jurisdictions including france switzerland and germany there are differing interpretations of tax laws and regulations and as a result significant disputes may arise with these tax authorities involving issues of the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions we evaluate our exposures associated with our tax filing positions on a quarterly basis 

we record liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions we do not believe any currently pending uncertain tax positions will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements although an adverse resolution of one or more of these uncertain tax positions in any period may have a material impact on the results of operations for that period 

as of december 31 2016  based on the expected outcome of certain examinations or as a result of the expiration of statutes of limitation for certain jurisdictions we believe that within the next twelve months it is reasonably possible that our previously unrecognized tax benefits could decrease by approximately 35 million  substantially all such amounts will impact our effective income tax rate 

during 2017 we expect to proceed with the implementation of our european headquarters and related restructuring plans that could have a significant effect on our effective tax rate many of these plans are operational changes that may impact our jurisdictional mix of earnings in the future 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

biorad operates and conducts business globally primarily through subsidiary companies established in the markets in which we trade goods are manufactured in a small number of locations and are then shipped to local distribution facilities around the world our product mix is diversified and certain products compete largely on product efficacy while others compete on price gross margins are generally sufficient to exceed normal operating costs and funding for research and development of new products as well as routine outflows of capital expenditures interest and taxes in addition to the annual positive cash flow from operating activities additional liquidity is readily available via the sale of shortterm investments and access to our 2000 million unsecured credit agreement that we entered into in june 2014 borrowings under the credit agreement are on a revolving basis and can be used to make permitted acquisitions for working capital and for other general corporate purposes we had no outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement as of december 31 2016  however 08 million was utilized for domestic standby letters of credit that reduced our borrowing availability the credit agreement matures in june 2019 

at december 31 2016  we had available 8394 million in cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments of which approximately 28 was held in our foreign subsidiaries we believe that our holdings of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments in the us and in our foreign subsidiaries are sufficient to meet both the current and longterm needs of our global operations the amount of funds held in the united states can fluctuate due to the timing of receipts and payments in the ordinary course of business and due to other reasons such as businessdevelopment activities as part of our ongoing liquidity assessments we regularly monitor the mix of domestic and foreign cash flows both inflows and outflows repatriation of overseas funds will result in additional us federal and state income tax payments in general it is our practice and intention to indefinitely reinvest the cash generated by our foreign subsidiaries in our foreign subsidiaries operations 

under domestic and international lines of credit standby letters of credit and guarantee arrangements we had 2057 million available for borrowing and usage as of december 31 2016  which was reduced by 54 million that was utilized for standby letters of credit and guarantee arrangements issued by our banks to support our obligations management believes that this availability together with cash flow from operations will be adequate to meet our current objectives for operations research and development capital additions for manufacturing and distribution plant and equipment information technology systems and an acquisition of reasonable proportion to our existing total available capital 

while economic growth is somewhat improving instability still exists in developed nations and in the us such as the slowing rate of growth in the chinese economy and in emerging markets especially those oilproducing countries that have been affected by a decline in oil prices which may adversely affect our future results of cash flows demand for our products and services could change more dramatically than in previous years based on activity funding reimbursement constraints and support levels from government universities hospitals and private industry including diagnostic laboratories the need for certain sovereign nations with large annual deficits to curtail spending could lead to slower growth of or even a decline in our business sovereign nations either delaying payment for goods and services or renegotiating their debts could impact our liquidity the situation in these sovereign nations is continuously evolving and we have no greater knowledge of the situation other than what is publicly reported as of december 31 2016 and december 31 2015  we had accounts receivable net of an allowance for doubtful accounts in spain italy greece and portugal of 327 million and 407 million  respectively 

cash flows from operations 

net cash provided by operations was 2164 million  1862 million and 2733 million in 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively the net increase between 2016 and 2015 of 302 million primarily resulted from 

 

the net decrease between 2015 and 2014 of 871 million primarily resulted from 

 

we regularly review past due receivables to assess the allowance for doubtful accounts and believe net accounts receivable are fully realizable we also routinely review inventory for the impact of obsolescence and changes in market prices caused by the introduction of new products technologies and in government reimbursement policies cash flows from operations during the first quarter have historically had larger payments for royalties fourth quarter sales commissions to third parties and annual employee bonuses and we expect this pattern to recur in the first quarter of 2017  

cash flows from investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities was 2139 million  1669 million and 1905 million for 2016  2015 and 2014  respectively purchases net of sales and maturities of marketable securities and investments had an overall decrease of 132 million in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to a decrease in maturities and securities sales partially offset by a decrease in purchases purchases net of sales and maturities of marketable securities and investments had an overall decrease of 354 million in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to an increase in purchases partially offset by an increase in maturities and securities sales 

shortterm restricted investments of 456 million and 421 million in 2016 and 2015 respectively represent a money market fund for collateral that secures workers compensation and general liability insurance investment income accrues to us and is recorded in investment proceeds and miscellaneous receipts net in the consolidated statements of cash flows 

our investment objective is to maintain liquidity to meet anticipated operational and other corporate requirements in which capital is preserved and increased through investing in low risk high quality securities with commensurate returns consistent with our risk tolerance level 

purchases of intangible assets were higher in 2014 than in 2016 and 2015 primarily due to higher purchases of licenses payments for acquisitions net of cash received and longterm investments in 2016 and 2014 were primarily due to the following 

 

we continue to review possible acquisitions to expand both our life science and clinical diagnostics segments such as our acquisition of raindance in february 2017 we routinely meet with the principals or brokers of the subject companies we are currently in discussion and assessing a few possible acquisitions in which we expect our current reported cash and cash equivalents to be sufficient for any cash consideration for these possible acquisitions however it is not certain at this time that any of these discussions involving material or significant acquisitions will advance to completion 

capital expenditures in 2016 totaled 1414 million  compared to 1120 million and 1210 million in 2015 and 2014  respectively capital expenditures represent the addition and replacement of production machinery and research equipment ongoing manufacturing and facility additions for expansion regulatory environmental and compliance also included in capital expenditures are investments in business systems and data communication upgrades and enhancements all periods include equipment placed with clinical diagnostics segment customers who then contract to purchase our reagents for use as we continue to implement the remaining phases of the erp platform we expect capital expenditures to moderate in 2017 and then decline over the next couple of years capital expenditures were lower in 2015 compared to 2016 as the second phase was implemented in july 2015 and the third phase of the erp system ramped up in 2016 capital expenditures were higher in 2014 than in 2015 as we were in the development stages in which appropriate costs are capitalized of implementing the second phase of a global single instance erp platform the current estimated future project cost for global implementation for the single instance erp platform is projected to be 90 million to 130 million and is estimated to take approximately the next two to three years to fully implement 

cash flows from financing activities 

net cash provided by financing activities was 90 million  86 million and 117 million in 2016  2015 and 2014  respectively net cash provided by financing activities in 2016 2015 and 2014 was primarily from proceeds from issuance of our common stock additionally in 2016 2015 and 2014 there were payments of 35 million 

30 million and 24 million respectively to propel labs shareholders in contingent consideration for sales milestones that were associated with the valuation as of the 2012 acquisition date in 2014 there was also the payment of a shortterm borrowing 

we have outstanding senior notes of 4250 million which are not due until 2020 we believe the current cash is sufficient to meet normal operating costs and funding for research and development of new products as well as routine outflows of capital expenditures interest and taxes 

the board of directors has authorized the repurchase of up to 180 million of biorads common stock of which 33 million has yet to be repurchased as of december 31 2016  the credit agreement may limit our ability to repurchase our stock in accordance with the terms of awards under the 2007 incentive award plan in june 2012 we withheld 122 shares of our class a common stock and 917 shares of our class b common stock to satisfy tax obligations due upon the vesting of restricted stock of certain of our employees which is considered a repurchase of 

our stock all of the restricted stock vested as of december 31 2013 and therefore we do not anticipate any repurchasing of shares for this purpose we had no other repurchases of our stock during 2016  2015 or 2014  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements that have had or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

contractual obligations 

the following summarizes certain of our contractual obligations as of december 31 2016 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our cash flows in future periods in millions 



recent accounting standards updates 

in january 2017 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued accounting standards update no “asu” 201704 simplifying the test for goodwill impairment asu 201704 removes step 2 of the goodwill impairment test which requires a hypothetical purchase price allocation a goodwill impairment will be the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill asu 201704 is effective prospectively for annual and interim periods beginning after december 15 2019 early adoption is permitted for any impairment tests performed after january 1 2017 asu 201704 will provide a more streamlined approach to evaluating future goodwill impairment and we early adopted on january 1 2017 we have not assessed the impact that asu 201704 will have on our consolidated financial statements because a goodwill impairment has not occurred after january 1 2017 

in january 2017 the fasb issued asu 201701 clarifying the definition of a business asu 201701 changes the definition of a business to assist entities with evaluating when a set of transferred assets and activities is a business if substantially all of the fair value is concentrated in a single asset or a group of similar assets the acquired determining whether a set constitutes a business is critical because the accounting for a business combination differs significantly from that of an asset acquisition asu 201701 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2017 and interim periods within those years asu 201701 will be applied prospectively to any transactions occur 

set is not a business if this is not met the entity then evaluates whether the set meets the requirement that a business include at a minimum an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs ring within the period of adoption early adoption is permitted including for interim or annual periods in which the financial statements have not been issued or made available for issuance we early adopted asu 201701 on january 1 2017 for our acquisition of raindance technologies inc asu 201701 did not affect the conclusion of it being a business combination see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements 

in november 2016 the fasb issued asu 201618 restricted cash asu 201618 requires entities to show the changes in the total of cash cash equivalents restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents in the statement of cash flows as a result entities will no longer present transfers between cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents in the statement of cash flows asu 201618 will be applied retrospectively and is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2017 and interim periods within those years early adoption is permitted we have had a limited amount of restricted cash of 20 million and 14 million as of december 31 2016 and 2015 respectively which was reclassified from cash to either prepaid expenses other current assets or other assets in the consolidated balance sheets at the time of adoption we cannot assure whether these same restricted cash amounts will be held or what other restricted cash we may have or that historically reported amounts will be similar 

in october 2016 the fasb issued asu 201616 intraentity transfers of assets other than inventory asu 201616 requires immediate recognition of income tax consequences of intercompany asset transfers other than inventory transfers existing gaap prohibits recognition of income tax consequences of intercompany asset transfers whereby the seller defers any net tax effect and the buyer is prohibited from recognizing a deferred tax asset on the difference between the newly created tax basis of the asset in its tax jurisdiction and its financial statement carrying amount as reported in the consolidated financial statements asu 201616 specifically excludes from its scope intercompany inventory transfers whereby the recognition of tax consequences will take place when the inventory is sold to third parties asu 201616 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2017 and interim periods within those fiscal years early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of an annual reporting period for which financial statements have not been issued or made available for issuance we do not plan to early adopt asu 201616 we are currently evaluating the effect asu 201616 will have on our consolidated financial statements 

in august 2016 the fasb issued asu 201615 classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments asu 201615 is intended to reduce diversity in practice in how certain transactions are classified in the statement of cash flows asu 201615 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2017 and interim periods within those fiscal years with early adoption permitted we are currently evaluating the effect asu 201615 will have on our consolidated statements of cash flows if any 

in june 2016 the fasb issued asu 201613 measurement of credit losses on financial instruments asu 201613 will replace the current incurred loss approach with an expected loss model for trade and other receivables and instruments measured at amortized cost and require entities to record allowances for availableforsale debt securities rather than reduce the carrying amount under the current otherthantemporary impairment model asu 201613 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2019 and interim periods within those fiscal years early adoption is permitted for all entities for annual periods beginning after december 15 2018 and interim periods therein we are currently evaluating the effect asu 201613 will have on our consolidated financial statements 

in march 2016 the fasb issued asu 201609 improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting asu 201609 will require all income tax effects of awards to be recognized in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled it also will allow an employer to repurchase more of an employee’s shares than it can today for tax withholding purposes without triggering liability accounting and to make a policy election to account for forfeitures as they occur asu 201609 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2016 and interim periods 

within those fiscal years we adopted asu 201609 on january 1 2017 and made a policy election to account for forfeitures as they occur we do not expect asu 201609 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

in march 2016 the fasb issued asu 201607 simplifying the transition to the equity method of accounting which eliminates the requirement to retrospectively apply the equity method in previous periods when an investor initially obtains significant influence over an investee under current guidance an investor that does not consolidate an investment and initially accounts for it under a method other than the equity method is required to retrospectively apply the equity method in prior periods in which it held the investment when it subsequently obtained significant influence asu 201607 will be applied on a prospective basis and is effective for all entities for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2016 and interim periods within those years we adopted asu 201607 on january 1 2017 and do not expect it to materially affect our consolidated financial statements unless our situation changes regarding our ability to influence the investee in the future as a result of our cost method investment in sartorius ag see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements 

in february 2016 the fasb issued asu 201602 leases which will require among other items lease accounting to recognize most leases as assets and liabilities on the balance sheet qualitative and quantitative disclosures will be enhanced to better understand the amount timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases asu 201602 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2018 and interim periods within those fiscal years with early adoption permitted we do not plan to early adopt asu 201602 will be adopted on a modified retrospective basis with elective reliefs which requires application of asu 201602 for all periods presented we are currently gathering documenting and analyzing lease agreements related to this asu and anticipate material additions to the balance sheet for rightofuse assets offset by the associated liabilities 

in january 2016 the fasb issued asu 201601 recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities amendments under asu 201601 among other items require that all equity investments in unconsolidated entities other than those accounted for using the equity method of accounting will generally be measured at fair value through earnings there will no longer be an availableforsale classification for which changes in fair value are reported in other comprehensive income for equity securities with readily determinable fair values for equity investments without readily determinable fair values the cost method is also eliminated however entities will be able to elect to record equity investments without readily determinable fair values at cost less impairment and plus or minus subsequent adjustments for observable price changes changes in the basis of these equity investments will be reported in current earnings asu 201601 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2017 and interim periods within those fiscal years for equity securities that would be affected by asu 201601 see the availableforsale investments table in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements at the time of adoption we cannot assure whether these same equity securities will be held or what other equity securities we may have or that historically reported changes will be similar 

in september 2015 the fasb issued asu 201516 simplifying the accounting for measurementperiod adjustments which eliminates the requirement for an acquirer in a business combination to account for measurementperiod adjustments retrospectively under asu 201516 acquirers must recognize measurementperiod adjustments during the period in which they determine the amounts including the effect on earnings of any amounts they would have recorded in previous periods if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date the measurement period cannot exceed one year from the date of the acquisition asu 201516 was effective on january 1 2016 and we adopted it at the same time as a change in accounting policy which had no impact on our consolidated financial statements 

in july 2015 the fasb issued asu 201511 “simplifying the measurement of inventory” under current guidance an entity subsequently measures inventory at the lower of cost or market with market defined as replacement cost net realizable value nrv or nrv less a normal profit margin an entity uses current replacement cost provided that it is not above nrv ie the ceiling or below nrv less an “approximately normal profit margin” ie the floor asu 201511 eliminates this analysis and requires entities to measure most inventory “at the lower of cost and nrv” asu 201511 is effective prospectively for annual periods beginning after december 15 2016 and interim periods 

therein we adopted asu 201511 on january 1 2017 and do not expect it to have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements 

in april 2015 the fasb issued asu 201503 simplifying the presentation of debt issuance costs asu 201503 was issued to simplify the presentation of debt issuance costs by requiring debt issuance costs to be presented as a deduction from the corresponding debt liability this makes the presentation of debt issuance costs consistent with the presentation of debt discounts or premiums under prior us gaap debt issuance costs were reported on the balance sheet as assets and amortized as interest expense under asu 201503 debt issuance costs will continue to be amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method in august 2015 the fasb issued asu 201515 presentation and subsequent measurement of debt issuance costs associated with lineofcredit arrangements to clarify the sec staff’s position that it would not object to an entity deferring and presenting debt issuance costs as an asset and subsequently amortizing the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of the lineofcredit arrangement which is our current practice we adopted asu 201503 on january 1 2016 on a retrospective basis as a change in accounting policy the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2015 was retrospectively adjusted by decreasing other assets and longterm debt net of current maturities by 18 million respectively 

in may 2014 the fasb issued asu 201409 “revenue from contracts with customers” which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers asu 201409 will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in gaap when it becomes effective in august 2015 the fasb issued asu 201514 to defer the effective date for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2017 including interim periods within that reporting period early adoption is permitted as of the original effective date in asu 201409 which is annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2016 however we will not early adopt in december 2016 the fasb issued asu 201620 technical corrections and improvements to topic 606 revenue from contracts with customers which affect narrow aspects of the guidance issued in asu 201409 in may 2016 the fasb issued asu 201612 narrowscope improvements and practical expedients which amends and clarifies certain aspects in asu 201409 that include collectiblity presentation of sales and other taxes collected from customers noncash consideration contract modifications and completed contracts at transition in april 2016 the fasb issued asu 201610 identifying performance obligations and licensing which amends the guidance in asu 201409 on accounting for licenses of intellectual property and identifying performance obligations in march 2016 the fasb issued asu 201608 principal versus agent considerations reporting revenue gross versus net which amends the principal versus agent guidance in asu 201409 the standards are to be applied retrospectively and permit the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method we will use the cumulative effect transition method once we adopt asus 201409 201620 201612 201610 and 201608 on january 1 2018 we have completed revenue recognition diagnostic surveys across all regions in our decentralized sales contracting process which is based on local country commercial regulations and practices we have begun assessing individual contracts to identify performance obligations under these asu’s as compared with the deliverables and separate units of accounting previously identified under current us gaap to determine the effect that these asu’s will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures 

item 7a quantitive and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

financial risk management 

the main goal of biorad’s financial risk management program is to reduce the variance in expected cash flows arising from unexpected foreign exchange rate and interest rate changes financial exposures are managed through operational means and by using various financial instruments including cash and liquid resources borrowings and forward and spot foreign exchange contracts no derivative financial instruments are entered into for the purpose of trading or speculation company policy requires that all derivative positions are undertaken to manage the risks arising from underlying business activities these derivative transactions do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment derivative instruments used in these transactions are valued at fair value and changes in fair value are included in reported earnings 

foreign exchange risk we operate and conduct business in many countries and are exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates we face transactional currency exposures that arise when we enter into transactions denominated in currencies other than us dollars additionally our consolidated net equity is impacted by the conversion of the net assets of our international subsidiaries for which the functional currency is not the us dollar 

foreign currency exposures are managed on a centralized basis this allows for the netting of natural offsets and lowers transaction costs and net exposures where possible we seek to manage our foreign exchange risk in part through operational means including matching samecurrency revenues to samecurrency costs and samecurrency assets to samecurrency liabilities moreover weakening in one currency can often be offset by strengthening in another currency foreign exchange risk is also managed through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts positions are primarily in euro swiss franc british sterling singapore dollar brazilian real and japanese yen the majority of forward contracts are for periods of 90 days or less we record the change in value of our foreign currency receivables and payables as a foreign exchange gain loss on our consolidated statements of income along with the change in fair market value of the forward exchange contract used as an economic hedge of those assets or liabilities 

our forward contract holdings at yearend were analyzed to determine their sensitivity to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates all other variables were held constant market risk associated with derivative holdings is the potential change in fair value of derivative positions arising from an adverse movement in foreign exchange rates a decline of 10 on quoted foreign exchange rates would result in an approximate netpresentvalue loss of 30 million on our derivative position as of december 31 2016  this impact of a change in exchange rates excludes the offset derived from the change in value of the underlying assets and liabilities which could reduce the adverse effect significantly 

interest rate risk of debt instruments biorad centrally manages the shortterm cash surpluses and shortfalls of its subsidiaries our holdings of variable rate debt instruments at yearend were analyzed to determine their sensitivity to movements in interest rates due to the relatively small amount of shortterm variable rate debt we have outstanding there would not be a material impact to earnings or cash flows if interest rates moved adversely by 10 our longterm debt consists primarily of fixedrate instruments and is thus insulated from interest rate changes as of december 31 2016  the overall interest rate risk associated with our debt was not significant

general 

founded in 1952 and incorporated in 1957 biorad laboratories inc referred to in this report as “biorad” “we” “us” and “our” was initially engaged in the development and production of specialty chemicals used in biochemical pharmaceutical and other life science research applications we entered the field of clinical diagnostics with the development of our first test kit based on separation techniques and materials developed for life science research through internal research and development efforts and acquisitions we have expanded into various markets today biorad manufactures and supplies the life science research healthcare analytical chemistry and other markets with a broad range of products and systems used to separate complex chemical and biological materials and to identify analyze and purify their components 

as we broadened our product lines we also expanded our geographical market we have direct distribution channels in over 30  countries outside the united states through subsidiaries whose focus is sales customer service and product distribution in some regions sales efforts are supplemented by distributors and agents 

description of business 

business segments 

today biorad operates in two industry segments designated as life science and clinical diagnostics both segments operate worldwide our life science segment and our clinical diagnostics segment generated 34  and 65  respectively of our net sales for the year ended december 31 2015  we generated approximately 36  of our consolidated net sales for the year ended december 31 2015  from us sales and approximately 64  from sales in our remaining worldwide markets 

for a description of business and financial information on industry and geographic segments see note 14 of item 8 of part ii of this report 

life science segment 

our life science segment is at the forefront of discovery creating advanced tools to answer complex biological questions we are a leader in the life sciences market and develop manufacture and market a range of more than 5000 reagents apparatus and laboratory instruments that serve a global customer base many of our products are used in established research techniques biopharmaceutical production processes and food testing regimes these 

techniques are typically used to separate purify and identify biological materials such as proteins nucleic acids and bacteria within a laboratory or production setting we focus on selected segments of the life sciences market in proteomics the study of proteins genomics the study of genes biopharmaceutical production cell biology and food safety we estimate that the worldwide market for products in these selected segments was approximately 8 billion our principal life science customers include universities and medical schools industrial research organizations government agencies pharmaceutical manufacturers biotechnology researchers food producers and food testing laboratories 

clinical diagnostics segment 

our clinical diagnostics segment designs manufactures sells and supports test systems informatics systems test kits and specialized quality controls that serve clinical laboratories in the global diagnostics market our products currently address specific niches within the in vitro diagnostics ivd test market and we seek to focus on the higher margin higher growth segments of this market 

we supply more than 3000 different products that cover more than 300 clinical diagnostic tests to the ivd test market we estimate that the worldwide sales for products in the markets we serve were approximately 10 billion ivd tests are conducted outside the human body and are used to identify and measure substances in a patient’s tissue blood or urine our products consist of reagents instruments and software typically provided to our customers as an integrated package to allow them to generate reproducible test results revenue in this business is highly recurring as laboratories typically standardize test methodologies which are dependent on a particular supplier’s equipment reagents and consumable products an installed base of diagnostic test systems therefore typically creates an ongoing source of revenue through the sale of test kits for each sample analyzed on an installed system our principal clinical diagnostic customers include hospital laboratories reference laboratories transfusion laboratories and physician office laboratories 

raw materials and components 

we utilize a wide variety of chemicals biological materials electronic components machined metal parts optical parts computing and peripheral devices most of these materials and components are available from numerous sources and generally we have not experienced difficulty in securing adequate supplies however in certain instances we acquire components and materials from a sole supplier due to the regulatory environment in which we operate we may be unable to quickly establish additional or replacement sources for some components or materials 

patents trademarks and licenses 

we own numerous us and international patents and trademarks we also pay royalties on the sales of certain products under several patent license agreements we view these patents trademarks and license agreements as valuable assets however we believe that our ability to develop and manufacture our products depends primarily on our knowledge technology and special skills rather than our patent trademark and licensing positions 

seasonal operations and backlog 

our business is not inherently seasonal however the european custom of concentrating vacation during the summer months usually tempers third quarter sales volume and operating income 

for the most part we operate in markets characterized by short lead times and the absence of significant backlogs management has concluded that backlog information is not material to our business as a whole 

sales and marketing 

we conduct our worldwide operations through an extensive direct sales force and service network employing approximately 740  sales and service people around the world our sales force typically consists of experienced industry practitioners with scientific training and we maintain a separate specialist sales force for each of our segments we believe that this direct sales approach allows us to sell a broader range of our products and have more direct contact with our customers 

we also use a range of sales and marketing intermediaries smis in our international markets excluding western europe and canada the types of smis we utilize are distributors agents brokers and resellers we have programs and policies in place with our smis that require compliance with all applicable laws including adhering to our anticorruption standards to ensure a transparent sale to our customers 

our customer base is broad and diversified our worldwide customer base includes 1 prominent university and research institutions providing us access to more than 150000 scientists in the united states alone 2 hospital public health and commercial laboratories 3 other leading diagnostic manufacturers and 4 leading companies in the biotechnology pharmaceutical chemical and food industries in 2015  no single customer accounted for more than three  percent of our total net sales our sales are affected by a number of external factors for example a number of our customers particularly in the life science segment are substantially dependent on government grants and research contracts for their funding a significant reduction of government funding has in the past and could in the future have a detrimental effect on the results of this segment 

most of our international sales are generated by our whollyowned subsidiaries and their branch offices certain of these subsidiaries also have manufacturing facilities biorad’s international operations are subject to certain risks common to foreign operations in general such as changes in governmental regulations import restrictions and foreign exchange fluctuations 

competition 

the markets served by our product groups are highly competitive our competitors range in size from startups to large multinational corporations with significant resources and reach we seek to compete primarily in market segments where our products and technology offer customers specific advantages over the competition 

because of the breadth of its product lines our life science segment does not face the same competitors for all of its products competitors in this market include ge biosciences merck millipore and thermo fisher scientific we compete primarily based on meeting performance specifications and offering complete solutions 

major competitors of our clinical diagnostics segment include roche abbott laboratories siemens danaher thermo fisher becton dickinson biomérieux ortho clinical diagnostics tosoh immucor and diasorin 

research and development 

we conduct extensive research and development activities in all areas of our business employing approximately 745  people worldwide in these activities research and development has played a major role in biorad’s growth and is expected to continue to do so in the future our research teams are continuously developing new products and new applications for existing products in our development of new products and applications we interact with scientific and medical professionals at universities hospitals and medical schools and within our industry we spent approximately 1930 million  2203 million  and 2110 million  on research and development activities in 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively 

regulatory matters 

the development testing manufacturing marketing postmarket surveillance distribution advertising and labeling of certain of our products primarily diagnostic products are subject to regulation in the united states by the center for devices and radiological health of the us food and drug administration fda and in other jurisdictions by state and foreign government authorities fda regulations require that some new products have premarketing clearance or approval by the fda and require certain products to be manufactured in accordance with fda’s “good manufacturing practice” regulations to be extensively tested and to be properly labeled to disclose test results and performance claims and limitations after a product that is subject to fda regulation is placed on the market numerous regulatory requirements apply including for example the requirement that we comply with recordkeeping and reporting requirements such as the fda’s medical device reporting regulations and reporting of corrections and removals the fda enforces these requirements by inspection and market surveillance the fda has authority to take various administrative and legal actions against us for our or our products’ failure to comply with relevant legal or regulatory requirements including issuing warning letters initiating product seizures requesting or requiring product recalls or withdrawals and other civil or criminal sanctions among other things 

we are also subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business such laws include without limitation state and federal antikickback fraud and abuse false claims privacy and security and physician sunshine laws and regulations if our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to us we may be subject to penalties including without limitation civil and criminal penalties damages fines the curtailment or restructuring of our operations exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results 

sales of our products will depend in part on the extent to which our products or diagnostic tests using our products will be covered by thirdparty payors such as government health care programs commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations these thirdparty payors are increasingly reducing reimbursements for certain medical products and services in addition the us government state legislatures and foreign governments have continued implementing cost containment programs including price controls and restrictions on reimbursement adoption of price controls and costcontainment measures and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures could further limit our net revenue and results decreases in thirdparty reimbursement for our products or diagnostic tests using our products or a decision by a thirdparty payor to not cover our products could reduce or eliminate utilization of our products and have a material adverse effect on our sales results of operations and financial condition in addition healthcare reform measures have been and will be adopted in the future any of which could limit the amounts that governments will pay for healthcare products and services which could result in reduced demand for our products or additional pricing pressures 

as a multinational manufacturer and distributor of sophisticated instrumentation we must meet a wide array of electromagnetic compatibility and safety compliance requirements to satisfy regulations in the united states the european union and other jurisdictions 

our operations are subject to federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations that govern such activities as transportation of goods emissions to air and discharges to water as well as handling and disposal practices for solid hazardous and medical wastes in addition to environmental laws that regulate our operations we are also subject to environmental laws and regulations that create liabilities and cleanup responsibility for spills disposals or other releases of hazardous substances into the environment as a result of our operations or otherwise impacting real property that we own or operate the environmental laws and regulations could also subject us to claims by third parties for damages resulting from any spills disposals or releases resulting from our operations or at any of our properties 

these regulatory requirements vary widely among countries 

employees 

at december 31 2015  biorad had approximately 7770  employees approximately eight  percent of our approximately 3100  us employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement which will expire on november 8 2016 many of our nonus fulltime employees especially in france are covered by collective bargaining agreements we consider our employee relations in general to be good

in evaluating our business and whether to invest in any of our securities you should carefully read the following risk factors in addition to the other information contained in this annual report we believe that any of the following risks could have a material effect on our business results of operations or financial condition our industry or the trading price of our common stock we operate in a continually changing business environment and new risks and uncertainties emerge from time to time we cannot predict these new risks and uncertainties nor can we assess the extent to which any such new risks and uncertainties or the extent to which the risks and uncertainties set forth below may adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition our industry or the trading price of our common stock 

our settlement with government agencies in connection with violations by us of the us foreign corrupt practices act could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

as previously disclosed we entered into a nonprosecution agreement npa with the us department of justice doj and the securities and exchange commission sec and consented to the entry of an order by the sec sec order effective november 3 2014 which actions resolved both the doj and the sec investigations into our violations of the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa under the terms of the npa and the sec order we agreed to pay a financial penalty and certain amounts in disgorgement and interest as well as to compliance reporting and cooperation obligations to be performed for two years 

we cannot be certain that our remediation efforts will be sufficient to comply with the terms of the npa and the sec order our failure to comply with the npa and the sec order could result in future actions against us by the doj and the sec in addition whether by virtue of disclosure of the npa and the sec order or otherwise we may be subject to investigations by foreign governments or further claims by third parties arising from conduct subject to the investigation or our other international operations for additional information regarding further claims by third parties see part i item 3 of this annual report many of our customers in our significant international operations are government agencies or stateowned or statecontrolled universities hospitals and laboratories the disclosure of the npa and the sec order could harm our reputation with these customers which could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

our international operations expose us to additional costs and legal and regulatory risks which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we have significant international operations we have direct distribution channels in over 30  countries outside the united states and in 2015 our foreign subsidiaries generated 64  of our net sales compliance with complex foreign and us laws and regulations that apply to our international operations increases our cost of doing business these numerous and sometimes conflicting laws and regulations include among others data privacy requirements particularly with respect to the recent invalidation of the useuropean union safe harbor by the european court of justice labor relations laws tax laws anticompetition regulations import and trade restrictions export requirements us laws such as the fcpa and other us federal laws and regulations established by the office of foreign asset control local laws such as the uk bribery act 2010 or other local laws which prohibit corrupt payments to governmental officials or certain payments or remunerations to customers 

given the high level of complexity of these laws there is a risk that we may inadvertently breach some provisions for example through fraudulent or negligent behavior of individual employees our failure to comply with certain formal documentation requirements or otherwise our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate these risks and manage these challenges through policies procedures and internal controls however we have a dispersed international sales organization and we use distributors and agents in many of our international operations this structure makes it more difficult for us to ensure that our international selling operations comply with our global policies and procedures 

violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines criminal sanctions against us our officers or our employees requirements to obtain export licenses cessation of business activities in sanctioned countries implementation of compliance programs and prohibitions on the conduct of our business violations of laws and regulations also could result in prohibitions on our ability to offer our products in one or more countries and could materially damage our reputation our brand our international expansion efforts our ability to attract and retain employees or our business results of operations and financial condition see also our risk factor regarding government regulations below 

the industries and market segments in which we operate are highly competitive and we may not be able to compete effectively 

the life science and clinical diagnostics markets are each highly competitive some of our competitors have merged and some of our competitors have greater financial resources than we do and are less leveraged than we are making them better equipped to license technologies and intellectual property from third parties or to fund research and development manufacturing and marketing efforts for more information about our competitors see “competition” in part i item 1 of this annual report moreover competitive and regulatory conditions in many markets in which we operate restrict our ability to fully recover through price increases higher costs of acquired goods and services resulting from inflation and other drivers of cost increases many public tenders have become more competitive due to governments lengthening the commitments of their public tenders to multiple years which reduce the number of tenders in which we can participate annually because the value of these multipleyear tenders is so high our competitors have been more aggressive with their pricing our failure to compete effectively andor pricing pressures resulting from competition could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

we may not be able to grow our business because of our failure to develop new or improved products 

our future growth depends in part on our ability to continue to improve our product offerings and develop and introduce new product lines and extensions that integrate technological advances in particular we may not be able to keep up with changes in the clinical diagnostics industry such as the trend toward molecular diagnostics or pointofcare tests if we are unable to integrate technological advances into our product offerings or to design develop manufacture and market new product lines and extensions successfully and in a timely manner our business results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected we have experienced product launch delays in the past and may do so in the future we cannot assure you that our product and process development efforts will be 

successful or that new products we introduce will achieve market acceptance failure to launch successful new products or improvements to existing products may cause our products to become obsolete which could harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

we are subject to foreign currency exchange fluctuations which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

as stated above a significant portion of our operations and sales are outside of the united states when we make purchases and sales in currencies other than the us dollars we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar that may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition our international sales are largely denominated in local currencies as a result the strengthening of the us dollar negatively impacts our consolidated net sales expressed in us dollars conversely when the us dollar weakens our expenses at our international sites increase in addition the volatility of other currencies such as the swiss franc brazilian real and russian ruble may negatively impact our operations outside of the united states and increase our costs to hedge against currency fluctuations we cannot assure you that future shifts in currency exchange rates will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition for further information regarding our foreign exchange risk see “foreign currency exchange gains and losses” in part ii item 7 and “foreign exchange risk” in part ii item 7a of this annual report 

we may experience difficulties implementing our new global enterprise resource planning system 

we are engaged in a multiyear implementation of a new global enterprise resource planning system erp the erp is designed to efficiently maintain our books and records and provide information important to the operation of our business to our management team the erp will continue to require significant investment of human and financial resources in implementing the erp we may experience significant delays increased costs and other difficulties any significant disruption or deficiency in the design and implementation of the erp could adversely affect our ability to process orders ship product send invoices and track payments fulfill contractual obligations or otherwise operate our business for example we experienced system implementation issues in our clinical diagnostics segment during our first deployment that impacted invoicing and caused an increase in accounts receivable in our second deployment which we launched in july 2015 we experienced delays in manufacturing and logistics which adversely impacted our sales while we have invested significant resources in planning project management and training additional and significant implementation issues may arise particularly in the next few months as a result of our second deployment in addition our efforts to centralize various business processes and functions within our organization in connection with our erp implementation may disrupt our operations and negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition 

recent changes to our organizational structure and executive management team could negatively impact our business 

we made significant changes to our organizational structure in 2014 we functionalized our manufacturing and selling organizations globally and separated them from our marketing and research and development organizations specifically we combined our international selling organization with our north american selling divisions into one global selling group and consolidated our manufacturing procurement and logistics operations into one global supply chain group we also created new management positions to head each of these groups in addition we appointed new executives to head each of our life science and clinical diagnostics segments and we appointed a chief operating officer we also restructured our life science segment based on functional groups rather than product line divisions these changes may have unintended consequences such as distraction of our management and employees business disruption attrition of our workforce inability to attract or retain key employees and reduced employee morale or productivity 

our failure to establish and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could result in material misstatements in our financial statements our failure to meet our reporting obligations and cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information which in turn could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline 

maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to produce reliable financial statements as previously disclosed in connection with our assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements for the year ended december 31 2013 we identified a material weakness in the design of monitoring controls over operations at certain of our locations both within the united states and overseas as well as a lack of documentation required to operate these controls appropriately although we remediated this material weakness as of december 31 2014 we cannot assure you that additional material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting will not be identified in the future for example we previously identified different material weaknesses in internal controls at december 31 2012 and december 31 2010 both of which have been remediated 

such material weaknesses have adversely affected us in the past and could affect us in the future and the results of our periodic management evaluations and annual auditor attestation reports regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting required by section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 any failure to maintain new and more precise monitoring controls and improved detection and communication of financial misstatements across all levels of the organization could result in additional material weaknesses result in material misstatements in our financial statements and cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations this could cause us to lose public confidence and could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline for further information regarding our controls and procedures see part ii item 9a of this annual report 

breaches of our information systems could have material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

through our sales and ecommerce channels we collect and store confidential information that customers provide to among other things purchase products or services enroll in promotional programs and register on our web site we also acquire and retain information about suppliers and employees in the normal course of business we also create and maintain proprietary information that is critical to our business such as our product designs and manufacturing processes despite recent initiatives to improve our technology systems such as our enterprise resource planning implementation and the centralization of our global information technology organization we could experience a significant data security breach computer hackers may attempt to penetrate our or our vendors’ information systems and if successful misappropriate confidential customer supplier employee or other business information such as our intellectual property third parties could also gain control of our systems and use them for criminal purposes while appearing to be us as a result we could lose existing customers have difficulty attracting new customers be exposed to claims from customers financial institutions payment card associations employees and other persons have regulatory sanctions or penalties imposed incur additional expenses or lose revenues as a result of a data privacy breach or suffer other adverse consequences our operations and ability to process sales orders particularly through our ecommerce channels could also be disrupted any significant breakdown intrusion interruption corruption or destruction of our systems as well as any data breaches could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations see also our risk factors regarding our erp implementation above and our information technology systems below 

risks relating to intellectual property rights may negatively impact our business 

we rely on a combination of copyright trade secret patent and trademark laws and thirdparty nondisclosure agreements to protect our intellectual property rights and products however we cannot assure you that our intellectual property rights will not be challenged invalidated circumvented or rendered unenforceable or that meaningful protection or adequate remedies will be available to us for instance unauthorized third parties have attempted to copy our intellectual property reverse engineer or obtain and use information that we regard as 

proprietary or have developed equivalent technologies independently and may do so in the future additionally third parties have asserted patent copyright and other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to us and may do so in the future if we are unable to license or otherwise access protected technology used in our products or if we lose our rights under any existing licenses we could be prohibited from manufacturing and marketing such products from time to time we also must enforce our patents or other intellectual property rights or defend ourselves against claimed infringement of the rights of others through litigation as a result we could incur substantial costs be forced to redesign our products or be required to pay damages to an infringed party any of the foregoing matters could adversely impact our business results of operations and financial condition 

global economic conditions could continue to adversely affect our operations 

in recent years we have been faced with very challenging global economic conditions further deterioration in the global economic environment may result in decreased demand for our products increased competition downward pressure on the prices for our products and longer sales cycles a weakening of macroeconomic conditions may also adversely affect our suppliers which could result in interruptions in supply in the future we have also experienced delays in collecting receivables in certain countries in western europe and we may experience similar delays in these and other countries or regions experiencing liquidity problems as of december 31 2015  we had accounts receivable net of allowance for doubtful accounts in spain italy greece and portugal of 407 million  in addition a slowing of growth in the chinese economy and in emerging markets especially those oilproducing countries that have been affected by the recent decline in oil prices could adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

reductions in government funding and the capital spending programs of our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

our customers include universities clinical diagnostics laboratories government agencies hospitals and pharmaceutical biotechnology and chemical companies the capital spending programs of these institutions and companies have a significant effect on the demand for our products such programs are based on a wide variety of factors including the resources available to make such purchases the availability of funding from grants by governments or government agencies the spending priorities for various types of equipment and the policies regarding capital expenditures during industry downturns or recessionary periods if government funding to our customers were to decrease or if our customers were to decrease or reallocate their budgets in a manner adverse to us our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected for more information on our customers see “sales and marketing” in part i item 1 of this annual report 

changes in the healthcare industry could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

there have been and will continue to be significant changes in the healthcare industry in an effort to reduce costs these changes include 

 

 11 

diagnostic tests furnished to medicare feeforservice beneficiaries is made based on the medicare clinical laboratory fee schedule clfs a fee schedule established and adjusted from time to time by the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms some commercial payors are guided by the clfs in establishing their reimbursement rates clinicians may decide not to order clinical diagnostic tests if third party payments are inadequate and we cannot predict whether third party payors will offer adequate reimbursement for tests utilizing our products to make them commercially attractive legislation such as the patient protection and affordable care act as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act ppaca and the middle class tax relief and job creation act of 2012 has reduced the payments for clinical laboratory services paid under the clfs in addition the protecting access to medicare act of 2014 will make significant changes to the way medicare will pay for clinical laboratory services which will further reduce reimbursement rates 

 

to the extent that the healthcare industry seeks to address the need to contain costs stemming from reform measures such as those contained in the ppaca and the protecting access to medicare act of 2014 or in future legislation by limiting the number of clinical tests being performed or the amount of reimbursement available for such tests our business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected if these changes in the healthcare markets in the united states and europe continue we could be forced to alter our approach in selling marketing distributing and servicing our products 

we are subject to substantial government regulation and any changes in regulation or violations of regulations by us could adversely affect our business prospects results of operations or financial condition 

some of our products primarily our clinical diagnostic products production processes and marketing are subject to us federal state and local and foreign regulation including by the fda in the united states and its foreign counterparts the fda regulates our clinical diagnostic products as medical devices and we are subject to significant regulatory clearances or approvals to market our clinical diagnostic products and other requirements including for example recordkeeping and reporting requirements such as the fda’s medical device reporting regulations and reporting of corrections and removals the fda has broad regulatory and enforcement powers if the fda determines that we have failed to comply with applicable regulatory requirements it can impose a variety of enforcement actions ranging from public warning letters fines injunctions consent decrees and civil penalties to suspension or delayed issuance of approvals seizure or recall of our products total or partial shutdown of production withdrawal of approvals or clearances already granted and criminal prosecution for example the fda issued a warning letter in connection with its inspection of our manufacturing site in munich in february 2015 the scope of the inspection was for our products manufactured at this site which include collection devices and special chemistry tests we have taken action to remediate the issues identified in the letter and we submitted our official reply to the fda in september 2015 the fda has accepted the majority of our responses and a followup inspection required to close the warning letter is scheduled for april 2016 there has been no suspension of production or distribution activity as a result of this warning letter 

the fda can also require us to repair replace or refund the cost of devices that we manufactured or distributed 

in addition the fda may change its clearance and approval policies adopt additional regulations or revise existing regulations or take other actions which may prevent or delay approval or clearance of our products or impact our ability to modify our currently approved or cleared products on a timely basis changes in the fda’s review of certain clinical diagnostic products referred to as laboratory developed tests which are tests developed by a single laboratory for use only in that laboratory could affect some of our customers who use our life science instruments for laboratory developed tests in the past the fda has chosen to not enforce applicable regulations and has not reviewed such tests for approval however the fda has recently issued guidance that it will begin enforcing its medical device requirements including premarket submission requirements to such tests any delay in or failure 

to receive or maintain clearance or approval for our products could prevent us from generating revenue from these products and adversely affect our business operations and financial results additionally the fda and other regulatory authorities have broad enforcement powers regulatory enforcement or inquiries or other increased scrutiny on us could affect the perceived safety and efficacy of our products and dissuade our customers from using our products 

many foreign governments have similar rules and regulations regarding the importation registration labeling sale and use of our products such agencies may also impose new requirements that may require us to modify or reregister products already on the market or otherwise impact our ability to market our products in those countries for example europe is expected to publish broad changes to its regulations regarding in vitro diagnostic medical devices in 2016 including stricter product labeling requirements russia has recently enacted more stringent medical product registration and labeling regulations china has enacted stricter labeling requirements and we expect other countries such as brazil and india to impose more regulations that impact our product registrations due to these evolving and diverse requirements we face uncertain product approval timelines additional time and effort to comply reduced sales and potential fines for noncompliance increasing protectionism in such countries also impedes our ability to compete with local companies for example we may not be able to participate in certain public tenders in russia because of increasing measures to restrict access to such tenders for companies without local manufacturing capabilities specifically a resolution passed by russia in february 2015 prohibits the procurement of certain types of medical devices by russian state entities from foreign companies provided there are a sufficient number of russian manufacturers submitting tenders such regulations could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

we are also subject to government regulation of the use and handling of a number of materials and controlled substances the us drug enforcement administration establishes registration security recordkeeping reporting storage distribution and other requirements for controlled substances pursuant to the controlled substances act of 1970 failure to comply with present or future laws and regulations could result in substantial liability to us suspension or cessation of our operations restrictions on our ability to expand at our present locations or require us to make significant capital expenditures or incur other significant expenses 

we cannot assure you that we will be able to integrate acquired companies products or technologies into our company successfully or we may not be able to realize the anticipated benefits from the acquisitions 

as part of our overall business strategy we pursue acquisitions of and investments in complementary companies products and technologies for information about our recent acquisitions see “overview” in part ii item 7 of this annual report in order to be successful in these activities we must among other things 

 

the benefits of any acquisition may prove to be less than anticipated and may not outweigh the costs reported in our financial statements completing any potential future acquisitions could cause significant diversion of our management’s time and resources if we acquire new companies products or technologies we may be required to assume contingent liabilities or record impairment charges for goodwill and other intangible assets over time we cannot assure you that we will successfully overcome these risks or any other problems we encounter in connection 

with any acquisitions and any such acquisitions could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

product quality and liability issues could harm our reputation and negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition 

we must adequately address quality issues associated with our products including defects in our engineering design and manufacturing processes as well as defects in thirdparty components included in our products our instruments reagents and consumables are complex and identifying the root cause of quality issues especially those affecting reagents or thirdparty components is difficult we may incur significant costs and expend substantial time in researching and remediating such issues quality issues could also delay our launching or manufacturing of new products in addition quality issues unapproved uses of our products or inadequate disclosure of risks related to our products could result in product recalls or product liability or other claims being brought against us these issues could harm our reputation impair our relationship with existing customers and harm our ability to attract new customers which could negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition 

lack of key personnel could hurt our business 

our products are very technical in nature in general only highly qualified and welltrained scientists have the necessary skills to develop market and sell our products and many of our manufacturing positions require very specialized knowledge and skills in addition the global nature of our business also requires that we have sophisticated and experienced staff to comply with increasingly complex international laws and regulations we face intense competition for these professionals from our competitors customers marketing partners and other companies throughout our industry in particular the job market in northern california where many of our employees are located has improved significantly if we do not offer competitive compensation and benefits we may fail to retain or attract a sufficient number of qualified personnel which could impair our ability to properly run our business 

in some cases we rely on temporary personnel or consultants and we may do so in the future such temporary personnel or consultants may lack the knowledge andor specific skills necessary for our business require time to train without benefiting us through extended employment and increase our costs in addition as noted above our strategic initiatives such our internal restructuring and erp implementation may be burdensome and disruptive and lead to employee dissatisfaction and attrition 

a reduction or interruption in the supply of components and raw materials could adversely affect our manufacturing operations and related product sales 

the manufacture of many of our products requires the timely delivery of sufficient amounts of quality components and materials we manufacture our products in numerous manufacturing facilities around the world we acquire our components and materials from many suppliers in various countries we work closely with our suppliers to ensure the continuity of supply but we cannot guarantee these efforts will always be successful further while we seek to diversify our sources of components and materials in certain instances we acquire components and materials from a sole supplier in addition due to the regulatory environment in which we operate we may be unable to quickly establish additional or replacement sources for some components or materials if our supply is reduced or interrupted or of poor quality and we are unable to develop alternative sources for such supply our ability to manufacture our products in a timely or costeffective manner could be adversely affected which would adversely affect our ability to sell our products 

if our information technology systems are disrupted or if we fail to successfully implement manage and integrate our information technology and reporting systems our business results of operations and financial condition could be harmed 

our information technology it systems are an integral part of our business and a serious disruption of our it systems could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition we depend on our it systems to process orders manage inventory and collect accounts receivable our it systems also allow us to efficiently purchase products from our suppliers and ship products to our customers on a timely basis maintain costeffective operations and provide customer service we may experience disruption of our it systems due to redundancy issues with our network servers we cannot assure you that our contingency plans will allow us to operate at our current level of efficiency 

our ability to implement our business plan in a rapidly evolving market requires effective planning reporting and analytical processes we expect that we will need to continue to improve and further integrate our it systems reporting systems and operating procedures by training and educating our employees with respect to these improvements and integrations on an ongoing basis in order to effectively run our business we may suffer interruptions in service loss of data or reduced functionality when we upgrade or change systems if we fail to successfully manage and integrate our it systems reporting systems and operating procedures it could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition see also our risk factors regarding our erp implementation and data security above and events beyond our control below 

natural disasters terrorist attacks acts of war or other events beyond our control may cause damage or disruption to us and our employees facilities information systems security systems vendors and customers which could significantly impact our business results of operations and financial condition 

we have significant manufacturing and distribution facilities including in the western united states france switzerland germany and singapore in particular the western united states has experienced a number of earthquakes wildfires floods landslides and other natural disasters in recent years these occurrences could damage or destroy our facilities which may result in interruptions to our business and losses that exceed our insurance coverage in addition strikes or other labor unrest at any of our sites or surrounding areas could cause disruption to our business 

acts of terrorism bioterrorism violence or war could also affect the markets in which we operate our business operations and strategic plans political unrest may affect our sales in certain regions such as in southeast asia the middle east and eastern europe in particular the political turmoil in ukraine along with the response of the russian and us governments to this situation has the potential to impact our operations in russia any of these events could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

environmental health and safety regulations and enforcement proceedings may negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition 

our operations are subject to federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations that govern such activities as transportation of goods emissions to air and discharges to water as well as handling and disposal practices for solid hazardous and medical wastes in addition to environmental laws that regulate our operations we are also subject to environmental laws and regulations that create liability and cleanup responsibility for spills disposals or other releases of hazardous substances into the environment as a result of our operations or otherwise impacting real property that we own or operate the environmental laws and regulations also subject us to claims by third parties for damages resulting from any spills disposals or releases resulting from our operations or at any of our properties we must also comply with various health and safety regulations in the united states and abroad in connection with our operations 

we may in the future incur capital and operating costs to comply with currently existing laws and regulations and possible new statutory enactments and these expenditures may be significant we have incurred and may in the future incur fines related to environmental matters andor liability for costs or damages related to spills or other releases of hazardous substances into the environment at sites where we have operated or at offsite locations where we have sent hazardous substances for disposal we cannot assure you however that such matters or any future obligations to comply with environmental or health and safety laws and regulations will not adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

we may be subject to additional tax liabilities 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and many foreign jurisdictions we calculate our provision for income taxes in each jurisdiction in which we operate significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and in the ordinary course of business there are many tax positions taken where the ultimate resolution is uncertain we are subject to the examination of our tax positions in the united states and foreign jurisdictions taxing authorities have disagreed with our judgment in the past and may disagree with positions we take in the future resulting in assessments of additional taxes economic and political pressures to increase tax revenues in various jurisdictions may make resolving tax disputes more difficult for example in recent years the tax authorities in europe have disagreed with our tax positions related to hybrid debt research and development credits transfer pricing and indirect taxes among others we regularly assess the likelihood of the outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals the results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements in the period or periods for which that determination is made changes in factors outside of our control such as changes in tax laws or rates changes in the interpretation of tax laws or changes in the jurisdictional mix of our earnings could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations 

our debt may restrict our future operations 

we have substantial debt and have the ability to incur additional debt as of december 31 2015  we had approximately 4360 million  of outstanding indebtedness in addition we have a revolving credit facility that provides for up to 2000 million  08 million  of which has been utilized for domestic standby letters of credit our incurrence of substantial amounts of debt may have important consequences for instance it could 

 

our existing credit facility and the terms of our other debt instruments including agreements we may enter in the future contain or will contain covenants imposing significant restrictions on our business these restrictions may affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise these covenants place restrictions on our ability to among other things incur additional debt acquire other businesses or assets through merger or purchase create liens make investments enter into transactions with affiliates sell assets in the case of some of our subsidiaries guarantee debt and declare or pay dividends redeem stock or make other distributions to stockholders our existing credit facility also requires 

that we comply with certain financial ratios including a maximum consolidated leverage ratio test and a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio test 

our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control including prevailing economic financial and industry conditions the breach of any of these restrictions could result in a default an event of default under our debt agreements would permit some of our lenders to declare all amounts borrowed from them to be due and payable together with accrued and unpaid interest in addition acceleration of our other indebtedness may cause us to be unable to make interest payments on our outstanding notes and repay the principal amount of our outstanding notes or may cause the future subsidiary guarantors if any to be unable to make payments under the guarantees 

we are subject to healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations and could face substantial penalties if we are unable to fully comply with such laws 

we are subject to healthcare fraud and abuse regulation and enforcement by both the us federal government and the us states and foreign governments in which we conduct our business these healthcare laws and regulations include for example 

 

 

 

 

 

these laws will continue to impose administrative cost and compliance burdens on us the shifting compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust systems to comply with multiple jurisdictions with different compliance andor reporting requirements increases the possibility that a healthcare company may violate one or more of these requirements in addition any action against us for violation of these laws even if we successfully defend against it could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business if our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us we may be subject to penalties including civil and criminal penalties damages fines exclusion from the medicare and medicaid programs and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business results of operations and financial condition 

we may incur losses in future periods due to writedowns in the value of financial instruments 

we have positions in a variety of financial instruments including asset backed securities and other similar instruments financial markets are quite volatile and the markets for these securities can be illiquid the value of these securities will continue to be impacted by external market factors including default rates changes in the value of the underlying property such as residential or commercial real estate rating agency actions the prices at which observable market transactions occur and the financial strength of various entities such as financial guarantors who provide insurance for the securities should we need to convert these positions to cash we may not be able to sell these instruments without significant losses due to current debtor financial conditions or other market considerations 

regulations related to “conflict minerals” could adversely impact our business 

as part of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the sec adopted disclosure requirements regarding the use of certain minerals known as conflict minerals which are mined from the democratic republic of congo drc and adjoining countries as well as procedures regarding a manufacturers efforts to identify the sourcing of such minerals and metals produced from those minerals the european union is considering additional reporting obligations we have incurred and will continue to incur additional costs in order to comply with the sec’s disclosure requirements in addition we might incur further costs due to possible changes to our products processes or sources of supply as a consequence of our due diligence activities as our supply chain is complex we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins of the specified minerals used in our products through our due diligence procedures which may harm our reputation in addition we may encounter challenges to satisfy those customers who require that all of the components of our products be certified as “drc conflict free” which could place us at a competitive disadvantage if we do not do so we filed our report for the calendar year 2014 with the sec on june 1 2015 

risks related to our common stock 

  

a significant majority of our voting stock is held by the schwartz family which could lead to conflicts of interest 

we have two classes of voting stock class a common stock and class b common stock with a few exceptions holders of class a and class b common stock vote as a single class when voting as a single class each share of class a common stock is entitled to onetenth of a vote while each share of class b common stock has one vote in the election or removal of directors the classes vote separately and the holders of class a common stock are entitled to elect 25 of the board of directors with holders of class b common stock electing the remaining directors 

as a result of the schwartz familys ownership of our class a and class b common stock they are able to elect a majority of our directors effect fundamental changes in our direction and control matters affecting us including the determination of business opportunities that may be suitable for our company the schwartz family may exercise its control over us according to interests that are different from other investors’ or debtors’ interests in particular this concentration of ownership and voting power may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

this discussion should be read in conjunction with the information contained in our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes which are an integral part of the statements 

overview  we are a multinational manufacturer and worldwide distributor of our own life science research and clinical diagnostics products our business is organized into two primary segments life science and clinical diagnostics with the mission to provide scientists with specialized products needed for biological research and clinical diagnostics 

we sell more than 8000 products and services to a diverse client base comprised of scientific research healthcare education and government customers worldwide we do not disclose quantitative information about our different products and services as it is impractical to do so based primarily on the numerous products and services that we sell and the global markets that we serve 

we manufacture and supply our customers with a range of reagents apparatus and equipment to separate complex chemical and biological materials and to identify analyze and purify components because our customers require standardization for their experiments and test results much of our revenues are recurring 

we are impacted by the support of many governments for both research and healthcare the current global economic outlook is still uncertain as the need to control government social spending by many governments limits opportunities for growth approximately 36  of our 2015  consolidated net sales are derived from the united states and approximately 64  are derived from international locations with europe being our largest region overall the international sales are largely denominated in local currencies such as the euro swiss franc japanese yen chinese yuan and british sterling as a result our consolidated net sales expressed in dollars benefit when the us dollar weakens and suffer when the dollar strengthens when the us dollar strengthens we benefit from lower cost of sales from our own international manufacturing sites as well as nonus suppliers and from lower international operating expenses 

in january 2016 we acquired a high performance analytical flow cytometer platform from propel labs propel that will enable advanced and novice users to perform basic and multiparameter cytometry for a wide range of applications and chemistries the aggregate consideration for the instrument consisted of a cash payment in january 2016 of 100 million with payments of up to 200 million due upon the completion of certain technical milestones following the completion of these milestones semiannual performance payments to propel will be required based on a percentage of sales through 2020 biorad expects to launch the instrument later this year 

as previously disclosed in may 2010 we voluntarily disclosed to the us department of justice doj and the securities and exchange commission sec certain likely or potential violations of the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa effective november 3 2014 we entered into a nonprosecution agreement npa with the doj and consented to the entry of an order by the sec sec order which actions resolve both the doj and sec investigations as a result of the settlements with the doj and the sec during the fourth quarter of 2014 we paid a total of 551 million that included a penalty of 144 million  351 million  in disgorgement and 56 million  in interest 

in april 2014 we acquired 100 of the issued and outstanding stock of gnubio inc gnubio this acquisition was accounted for as a business combination and is included in our clinical diagnostics segments results of operations from the acquisition date the final fair values of the net assets acquired from gnubio as of the acquisition date were determined to be 464 million of indefinitelived intangible assets specifically inprocess research and development or iprd 135 million of goodwill and 95 million of net tangible liabilities 

the fair value of the consideration as of the acquisition date was 504 million which included 397 million paid in cash at the closing date and 107 million in contingent consideration potentially payable to gnubios shareholders the contingent consideration was based on a probabilityweighted income approach that could reach 700 million upon the achievement of all developmentregulatory and sales milestones the contingent consideration for the developmentregulatory milestones was valued at 107 million based on assumptions regarding the probability of achieving the milestones with such amounts discounted to present value the contingent consideration related to the developmentregulatory milestones was revalued to a fair value of 100 million as of december 31 2015 and 2014 and is included in other current liabilities the contingent consideration for the sales milestones at the acquisition date and at december 31 2015 was determined to be negligible using the riskneutral probability of being in the money based on a blackscholes framework the sales that are required under the purchase agreement have a low probability of obtaining the thresholds 

during the third quarter of 2012 we recognized a contingent consideration liability of 446 million  upon our acquisition of a new cell sorting system from propel labs inc the fair value of the contingent consideration was based on a probabilityweighted income approach related to the achievement of certain development and sales milestones the development milestone was achieved and paid in 2013 the first sales milestone was reached resulting in payments of 24 million  and 30 million  in the fourth quarter of 2014 and the first quarter of 2015 respectively during 2015 the contingent consideration was revalued by a decrease of 56 million  to its estimated fair value of 91 million  as of december 31 2015  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the accompanying discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities and contingencies as of the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis we base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources however future events may cause us to change our assumptions and estimates which may require adjustment actual results could differ from these estimates we have determined that for the periods reported in this annual report on form 10k the following accounting policies and estimates are critical in understanding our financial condition and results of operations 

accounting for income taxes   management is required to make estimates related to our income tax provision in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate this process involves estimating our current tax exposures as well as making judgments regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets in each jurisdiction deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect the tax effects of losses credits and temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes management assesses the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent management believes that recovery is not likely a valuation allowance must be established to the extent management establishes a valuation allowance or increases this allowance in a period an increase to expense within the provision for income taxes in the consolidated statements of income may result 

we have recorded a valuation allowance of 583 million  and 586 million  as of december 31 2015  and 2014  respectively due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize some of the deferred tax assets primarily consisting of certain foreign net operating losses carried forward the valuation allowance is based on management’s current estimates of taxable income for the jurisdictions in which we operate and the period over which the deferred tax assets will be recoverable in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or these estimates are adjusted in future periods an additional valuation allowance may need to be established which would increase the tax provision lowering income and impacting our financial position should realization of these deferred tax assets 

for which a valuation allowance has been provided occur the provision for income taxes may decrease raising income and positively impacting biorad’s financial position 

we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements on a particular tax position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon settlement the amount of unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted as appropriate for changes in facts and circumstances such as significant amendments to existing tax law new regulations or interpretations by the taxing authorities new information obtained during a tax examination or resolution of an examination we recognize both accrued interest and penalties where appropriate related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense our overall effective tax rate is subject to fluctuations because of changes in the geographic mix of earnings changes to statutory tax rates and tax laws and because of the impact of various tax audits and assessments as well as generation of tax credits 

valuation of goodwill and longlived assets   goodwill represents the excess of the cost over the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses goodwill amounts are assigned to reporting units at the time of acquisition and are adjusted for any subsequent significant transfers of business between reporting units we assess the impairment of goodwill annually in the fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable we perform the impairment tests of goodwill at our reporting unit level which is one level below our operating segments the goodwill impairment test consists of a twostep process the first step of the goodwill impairment test used to identify potential impairment compares the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is not required the second step if required compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill the fair value of a reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the price paid to acquire the reporting unit if the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill exceeds its implied fair value an impairment charge is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 

we use a projected discounted cash flow model to determine the fair value of a reporting unit this discounted cash flow method for determining goodwill may be different from the fair value that would result from an actual transaction between a willing buyer and a willing seller projections such as discounted cash flow models are inherently uncertain and accordingly actual future cash flows may differ materially from projected cash flows management judgment is required in developing the assumptions for the discounted cash flow model these assumptions include revenue growth rates profit margins future capital expenditures working capital needs expected foreign currency rates discount rates and terminal values we estimate future cash flows using current and longerterm high level financial forecasts these forecasts take into account the current economic environment the discount rates used are compiled using independent sources current trends in similar businesses and other observable market data changes to these rates might result in material changes in the valuation and determination of the recoverability of goodwill for example an increase in the discount rate used to discount cash flows will decrease the computed fair value 

impairment tests are highly sensitive to changes in assumptions and minor changes to assumptions that could result in impairment losses our forecasts utilized in our 2015  impairment test assumed among other things sales growth from executing our sales and marketing programs new product introductions successful product development and timely registration of our products when required while controlling costs in addition external factors such as currency inflation rates and cost of capital could affect the determination of fair value of our reporting units our impairment tests resulted in excessive fair value over book value ranging from 18 to more than 200 for our various reporting units if the initiatives mentioned above do not achieve the desired results or external factors change detrimentally future impairment losses may occur 

to validate the reasonableness of the reporting unit fair values we reconcile the aggregate fair values of the reporting units to the enterprise market capitalization in performing the reconciliation we may depending on the volatility of the market value of our stock price use either the stock price on the valuation date or the average stock price over a range of dates around the valuation date 

for purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment loss a longlived asset or assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities we assess the impairment of longlived assets including identifiable intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable factors that we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include 

 

when management determines that the carrying value of longlived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment we test for any impairment based on a projected undiscounted cash flow method projected future operating results and cash flows of the asset or asset group are used to establish the fair value used in evaluating the carrying value of longlived and intangible assets we estimate the future cash flows of the longlived assets using current and longterm financial forecasts the carrying amount of a longlived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset if this is the case an impairment loss would be recognized the impairment loss recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value there were no impairment losses recorded in 2015  and 2013  in 2014 we impaired licenses of a discontinued product line in the amount of 64 million  this impairment charge included 58 million  in cost of goods sold and 06 million  in research and development expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of income 

valuation of inventories   we value inventory at the lower of the actual cost to purchase andor manufacture the inventory or the current estimated net realizable value of the inventory we review inventory quantities on hand and reduce the cost basis of excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on an estimated forecast of product demand production requirements and the quality efficacy and potency of raw materials this review is done on a quarterly basis or if warranted by the circumstances more frequently in addition our industry is characterized by technological change frequent new product development and product obsolescence that could result in an increase in the amount of obsolete inventory quantities on hand our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate and if too high we may have overstated the carrying value of our inventory in the future if inventory is determined to be overvalued we would be required to write down the value of inventory to market and recognize such costs in our cost of goods sold at the time of such determination therefore although we make efforts to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand and perform procedures to safeguard overall inventory quality any significant unanticipated changes in demand technological developments regulations storage conditions or other economic or environmental factors affecting biological materials could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and reported results of operations 

valuation of investments   we regularly review our investments for factors that may indicate that a decline in the fair value of an investment below its carrying value is otherthantemporary some factors considered in evaluating whether or not a decline in fair value is otherthantemporary include our ability and intent to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for a recovery in value the duration and extent to which the fair value has been less than cost and the financial condition and prospects of the issuer such reviews are inherently uncertain in that the value of the investment may not fully recover or may decline further in future periods resulting in realized losses 

warranty reserves   we warrant certain equipment against defects in design materials and workmanship generally for a period of one year upon delivery and on acceptance of that equipment we establish as part of cost of goods sold a provision for the expected costs of such warranty repairs based on historical experience specific warranty terms and customer feedback a review is performed on a quarterly basis to assess the adequacy of our warranty reserve and it is adjusted if necessary the warranty reserve is based on actual experience and expected future costs to be incurred should realized costs be higher than expected costs cost of goods sold would be lower in the period of estimation and higher when realized 

allowance for doubtful accounts   we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the collectability of our customer accounts the amount of the allowance is determined by analyzing known uncollectible accounts the age of our receivables economic conditions in the customers’ country or industry historical losses and our customers’ general creditworthiness amounts later determined and specifically identified to be uncollectible are charged or written off against this allowance uncertainty in the current economic environment if prolonged could result in greater amounts becoming uncollectible in the future should the estimates of losses be higher than the actual uncollectible accounts we would report lower profitability when the estimates are made and higher profitability when the receivable is collected 

litigation accruals   we record as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets estimated amounts for claims that are probable and can be reasonably estimated the likelihood of a material change in these estimated liabilities is dependent on the possible outcome of settlement negotiations regulatory or judicial review and the development of facts and circumstances in extended litigation which could change claims or assessments when both the amount and range of loss on some outstanding litigation is uncertain we disclose in the footnotes of the financial statements when we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of a material liability that could result from unfavorable outcomes in litigation as events occur we will assess the potential liability related to our pending litigation and revise our estimates such revisions could materially impact our results of operations 

results of operations  sales gross margins and expenses 

the following shows cost of goods sold gross profit expense items and net income as a percentage of net sales 



net sales 

n et sales sales in 2015  were 202 billion  a decrease of 72  compared to 218 billion  in 2014  excluding the impact of foreign currency 2015  sales increased by approximately 16  compared to 2014  currency neutral sales growth was primarily reflected in the united states and china 

the life science segment sales in 2015  were 6950 million  a decrease of 46  compared to 2014  on a currency neutral basis sales increased 25  compared to 2014  the currency neutral sales increase was primarily in our droplet digital™ pcr western blotting process chromatography media and cell biology products the currency neutral sales increase was primarily in the united states and europe partially offset by lower sales in asia excluding china 

the clinical diagnostics segment sales in 2015  were 131 billion  a decrease of 85  compared to 2014  on a currency neutral basis sales increased 11  compared to 2014  the clinical diagnostics segment had currency neutral sales growth from quality controls and immunology products partially offset by declines in blood typing and infectious disease products currency neutral sales growth was primarily in north america china and latin america while european markets were still experiencing consolidation and pricing pressures 

n et sales sales in 2014 were 218 billion an increase of 20 compared to 213 billion in 2013 excluding the impact of foreign currency 2014 sales increased by approximately 33 compared to 2013 currency neutral sales growth was reflected in most regions primarily in the united states the emerging markets of eastern europe and china while currency neutral sales in japan decreased 

the life science segment sales in 2014 were 7283 million an increase of 26 compared to 2013 on a currency neutral basis sales increased 40 compared to 2013 the currency neutral sales increase was reflected across most product lines except for protein separations products currency neutral sales growth was primarily in north america europe and china partially offset by decreased sales in the rest of asia 

the clinical diagnostics segment sales in 2014 were 143 billion an increase of 17 compared to 2013 on a currency neutral basis sales increased 29 compared to 2013 clinical diagnostics had growth across most product lines on a currency neutral basis most notably from quality control products and blood typing sales growth was partially offset by lower sales for infectious disease in the serology product line primarily due to laboratory consolidation and pricing pressure in europe and north america    currency neutral sales growth was primarily in eastern europe and china partially offset by decreased sales in western europe 

gross margin 

consolidated gross margins were 555  in 2015  compared to 542  in 2014  life science segment gross margins in 2015  increased from 2014  by approximately 09 percentage points  primarily due to sales of higher gross margin products including droplet digital™ pcr gene expression and cell biology products in addition lower service costs in europe and costs associated with the closing of a manufacturing plant in 2014 contributed to higher margins clinical diagnostics segment gross margins in 2015  increased from 2014  by approximately 18 percentage points  the increase compared to 2014 was primarily due to the 2014 consolidation and closure of certain facilities and the discontinuation of an underperforming product line sales mix also contributed to the higher gross margins in 2015 

beginning in 2013 the patient protection and affordable care act as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act ppaca among other initiatives provided for a 23 annual excise tax on the sales of certain medical devices in the us biorad has been paying this excise tax on most of our us clinical diagnostic sales which we accounted for as a period cost in cost of goods sold however the consolidated appropriations act 2016 pub l 114113 signed into law on december 18 2015 includes a two year moratorium on the medical device excise tax during the period beginning on january 1 2016 and ending on december 31 2017 

  

consolidated gross margins were 542 in 2014 compared to 553 in 2013 life science segment gross margins in 2014 decreased from 2013 by approximately 01 percentage points essentially flat compared to 2013 lower margins were reflected in protein separation products and approximately 17 million of costs associated with the closing of a small manufacturing plant which were almost entirely offset by higher margins in process chromatography droplet digital™ pcr and food testing products clinical diagnostics segment gross margins in 2014 decreased from 2013 by approximately 15 percentage points the decrease primarily reflected approximately 83 million associated with the discontinuance of a product line in 2014 that was coupled with an increase in inventory reserves and the writedown of licenses for specific technology the decrease was also due to continued pricing pressure approximately 16 million associated with closing and consolidating certain facilities in 2014 and increased scrap for obsolete products 

selling general and administrative expense 

consolidated selling general and administrative expenses sga decreased to 7620 million  or 377  of sales in 2015  compared to 8082 million  or 372  of sales in 2014  underlying the overall decrease in sga was the impact of foreign currency an accrual of 195 million in 2014 associated with the sec and doj investigations relating to the fcpa investigation for which a final settlement was reached in the fourth quarter of 2014 and a reduction of 42 million from the revaluations of contingent consideration currency neutral increases in sga were primarily employeerelated expenses our largest cost facilities and professional fees partially offset by travel other increases in sga included 23 million of bad debt expense and a onetime distributor termination cost of 19 million 

consolidated sga represented 372 of sales in 2014 compared to 374 of sales in 2013 decreases in sga expense relative to sales were primarily driven by 

 

partially offsetting these decreased costs were 

 44 million 

 

research and development expense 

research and development expense decreased to 1930 million  or 96  of sales in 2015  compared to 2203 million  or 101  of sales in 2014  life science segment research and development expense decreased in 2015  from 2014  primarily due to headcount reductions lower supplies and lower external product development spend clinical diagnostics segment research and development expense decreased in 2015  from 2014  primarily due to the wind down of spending on projects as they approach launch and the discontinuation of an underperforming product line in 2014 

research and development expense increased to 2203 million or 101 of sales in 2014 compared to 2110 million or 99 of sales in 2013 life science segment research and development expense decreased slightly in 2014 from 2013 primarily due to projects nearing completion clinical diagnostics segment research and development expense increased in 2014 from 2013 primarily due to continued investments in diagnostic applications using the recently acquired droplet digital pcr technology and new instrument platforms and assays the increase also reflected approximately 31 million associated with the discontinuance of a product line in 2014 that included contractual costs and the writedown of equipment and licenses 

results of operations – nonoperating 

interest expense 

interest expense in 2015  decreased 20  to 217 million  compared to 2014  primarily due to 06 million in 2014 associated with our offer to settle the sec and doj investigations relating to the fcpa investigation for which a final settlement was reached in the fourth quarter of 2014 

interest expense in 2014 decreased 639 to 221 million compared to 2013 primarily due to the absence of interest expense of 187 million and 156 million associated with a call premium and expensing the remaining original bond discount and unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the 3000 million principal amount of senior subordinated notes 80 notes which were redeemed on september 30 2013 in addition interest expense in connection with reaching our final settlement with the sec and doj investigations relating to the fcpa was 06 million for 2014 compared to 50 million for 2013 

  

foreign currency exchange gains and losses 

foreign currency exchange gains and losses consist of foreign currency transaction gains and losses on intercompany net receivables and payables and the change in fair value of our forward foreign exchange contracts used to manage our foreign currency exchange risk net foreign currency exchange losses for 2015  2014  and 2013  were 102 million  93 million  and 86 million  respectively the 2015  2014  and 2013  net foreign currency exchange losses were attributable to market volatility increasing costs to hedge and the result of the estimating process inherent in the timing of shipments and payments of intercompany debt all years are affected by the economic hedging program we employ to hedge our intercompany receivables and payables 

other income and expense net 

other income and expense net includes investment and dividend income generally interest income on our cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and long term marketable securities other income expense net in 2015  decreased to 111 million  income compared to 130 million  income in 2014  the decrease was primarily due to lower interest and investment income primarily related to a weaker 2015 foreign currency exchange rate for ordinary and preferred dividends from our investment in sartorius ag and realized losses in 2015 compared to no realized losses in 2014 

other income expense net in 2014 increased to 130 million income compared to 128 million income in 2013 the increase was primarily due to higher dividends than in 2013 and realized gains in 2014 compared to realized losses in 2013 partially offset by lower interest on investment income than in 2013 sales of investments in 2013 were used to provide cash to redeem all of the 3000 million 80 senior subordinated notes 

effective tax rate 

our effective tax rate was 22  32  and 31  in 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively the effective tax rate for 2015 included a significant tax benefit from expected utilization of foreign tax credits in the us the effective tax rate for 2014 included nondeductible penalties and losses that were nonrecurring the effective tax rate for 2013 included a significant tax benefit related to the reinstated 2012 us federal research credit partially offset by an increase in tax liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits and audit settlements in our foreign jurisdictions 

our foreign taxes result primarily from income earned in france and switzerland many jurisdictions in which we operate including switzerland russia the uk and singapore have statutory tax rates that are significantly lower than the us statutory tax rate of 35  our effective tax rate may be impacted in the future either favorably or unfavorably by many factors including but not limited to changes to statutory tax rates changes in tax laws or regulations tax audits and settlements and generation of tax credits 

our income tax returns are audited by us federal state and foreign tax authorities we are currently under examination by many of these tax authorities the tax years open to examination include the years 2012 and forward for the us and the years 2008 and forward for certain foreign jurisdictions including france switzerland and germany there are differing interpretations of tax laws and regulations and as a result significant disputes may arise with these tax authorities involving issues of the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions we evaluate our exposures associated with our tax filing positions on a quarterly basis 

we record liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions we do not believe any currently pending uncertain tax positions will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements although an adverse resolution of one or more of these uncertain tax positions in any period may have a material impact on the results of operations for that period 

as of december 31 2015 based on the expected outcome of certain examinations or as a result of the expiration of statutes of limitation for certain jurisdictions we believe that within the next twelve months it is reasonably possible that our previously unrecognized tax benefits could decrease by approximately 40 million  substantially all such amounts will impact our effective income tax rate

biorad operates and conducts business globally primarily through subsidiary companies established in the markets in which we trade goods are manufactured in a small number of locations and are then shipped to local distribution facilities around the world our product mix is diversified and certain products compete largely on product efficacy while others compete on price gross margins are generally sufficient to exceed normal operating costs and funding for research and development of new products as well as routine outflows of capital expenditures interest and taxes in addition to the annual positive cash flow from operating activities additional liquidity is readily available via the sale of shortterm investments and access to our 2000 million unsecured credit agreement that we entered into in june 2014 borrowings under the credit agreement are on a revolving basis and can be used to make permitted acquisitions for working capital and for other general corporate purposes we had no outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement as of december 31 2015  however 08 million was utilized for domestic standby letters of credit that reduced our borrowing availability the credit agreement matures in june 2019 

at december 31 2015  we had available 7863 million  in cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments of which approximately 32  was held in our foreign subsidiaries we believe that our holdings of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments in the us and in our foreign subsidiaries are sufficient to meet both the current and longterm needs of our global operations the amount of funds held in the united states can fluctuate due to the timing of receipts and payments in the ordinary course of business and due to other reasons such as businessdevelopment activities as part of our ongoing liquidity assessments we regularly monitor the mix of domestic and foreign cash flows both inflows and outflows repatriation of overseas funds will result in additional us federal and state income tax payments in general it is our practice and intention to indefinitely reinvest the cash generated by our foreign subsidiaries in our foreign subsidiaries operations however during the fourth quarter of 2015 a foreign biorad entity repatriated approximately 107 million to the us 

under domestic and international lines of credit standby letters of credit and guarantee arrangements we had 2012 million  available for borrowing and usage as of december 31 2015  which was reduced by 26 million  that was utilized for standby letters of credit and guarantee arrangements issued by our banks to support our obligations management believes that this availability together with cash flow from operations will be adequate to meet our current objectives for operations research and development capital additions for manufacturing and distribution plant and equipment information technology systems and an acquisition of reasonable proportion to our existing total available capital 

while economic growth is somewhat improving instability still exists in developed nations and in the us such as the slowing rate of growth in the chinese economy and in emerging markets especially those oilproducing countries that have been affected by the recent decline in oil prices which may adversely affect our future results of cash flows demand for our products and services could change more dramatically than in previous years based on activity funding reimbursement constraints and support levels from government universities hospitals and private industry including diagnostic laboratories the need for certain sovereign nations with large annual deficits to curtail spending could lead to slower growth of or even a decline in our business sovereign nations either delaying payment for goods and services or renegotiating their debts could impact our liquidity the situation in these sovereign nations is continuously evolving and we have no greater knowledge of the situation other than what is publicly reported as of december 31 2015  and december 31 2014  we had accounts receivable net of allowance for doubtful accounts in spain italy greece and portugal of 407 million  and 454 million  respectively most of the decrease from december 31 2014  was the result of a weakening foreign currency 

cash flows from operations 

net cash provided by operations was 1862 million  2733 million  and 1691 million  in 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively the net decrease between 2015  and 2014  of 871 million  primarily resulted from 

 

the net increase between 2014 and 2013 of 1042 million  primarily resulted from 

 

we regularly review past due receivables to assess the allowance for doubtful accounts and believe net accounts receivable are fully realizable we also routinely review inventory for the impact of obsolescence and changes in market prices caused by the introduction of new products technologies and in government reimbursement policies cash flows from operations during the first quarter have historically had larger payments for royalties fourth quarter sales commissions to third parties and annual employee bonuses and expect this pattern to recur in the first quarter of 2016  

cash flows from investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities was 1669 million  and 1905 million  for 2015  and 2014  respectively and net cash provided by investing activities was 09 million  in 2013  purchases net of sales and maturities of marketable securities and investments had an overall decrease of 354 million in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to an increase in purchases partially offset by an increase in maturities and securities sales purchases of marketable securities and investments and proceeds from sales of marketable securities and investments were both lower in 2014 than 2013 primarily due to sales of securities to provide cash to redeem the 3000 million 80 senior subordinated notes in 2013 in addition we purchased longer dated securities to take advantage of higher returns on investments and therefore we experienced an additional decline in maturities and redemptions of securities in 2014 compared to 2013 

shortterm restricted investments of 421 million in 2015 represent a money market fund for collateral that secures workers compensation and general liability insurance investment income accrues to us and is recorded in investment proceeds and miscellaneous receipts net in the consolidated statements of cash flows 

our investment objective is to maintain liquidity to meet anticipated operational and other corporate requirements in which capital is preserved and increased through investing in low risk high quality securities with commensurate returns consistent with our risk tolerance level 

purchases of intangible assets were higher in 2014 than in 2015 and 2013 primarily due to higher purchases of licenses payments for acquisitions net of cash received and longterm investments in 2014 and 2013 were primarily due to the following 

 

we continue to review possible acquisitions or asset purchases to expand both our life science and clinical diagnostics segments such as our purchase of an instrument from propel in january 2016 we routinely meet with the principals or brokers of the subject companies it is not certain at this time that any of these discussions involving material or significant acquisitions will advance to completion 

capital expenditures in 2015  totaled 1120 million  compared to 1210 million  and 1067 million  in 2014  and 2013  respectively capital expenditures represent the addition and replacement of production machinery and research equipment ongoing manufacturing and facility additions for expansion regulatory environmental and compliance also included in capital expenditures are investments in business systems and data communication upgrades and enhancements all periods include equipment placed with clinical diagnostics segment customers who then contract to purchase our reagents for use as we continue to implement more phases of the erp platform and expand our ecommerce platform we expect capital expenditures to continue to remain historically higher for the next three years or more however capital expenditures were lower in 2015 as we expect the third phase of the erp system to ramp up in 2016 capital expenditures were higher in 2014 than in 2015 and 2013 as we were in the development stages in which appropriate costs are capitalized of implementing the second phase of a global single instance erp platform in april 2013 we implemented the first phase of the global single instance erp platform and hence for the remainder of 2013 costs were no longer capitalized the current estimated future project cost for global 

implementation for the single instance erp platform is projected to be 150 million to 200 million and is estimated to take more than three years to fully implement 

cash flows from financing activities 

net cash provided by financing activities was 86 million  and 117 million  in 2015  and 2014  respectively and net cash used in financing activities was 3117 million  in 2013  net cash provided by financing activities in 2015 was primarily from proceeds from issuance of our common stock additionally in 2015 there was a payment of 30 million  to propel labs shareholders in contingent consideration for a sales milestone that was associated with the valuation as of the 2012 acquisition date net cash provided by financing activities in 2014 was primarily from proceeds from issuance of our common stock net cash provided by financing activities in 2014 was partially offset by a payment of 24 million to propel labs shareholders in contingent consideration for a sales milestone that was associated with the valuation as of the 2012 acquisition date and the payment of a shortterm borrowing net cash used in financing activities in 2013 was primarily due to the early redemption of the 3000 million of 80 senior subordinated notes on september 30 2013 also in 2013 200 million was paid to propel labs shareholders in contingent consideration of which 199 million was associated with the valuation as of the 2012 acquisition date and the remainder was recognized in cash flows from operations additionally in 2013 60 million was paid to quantalife in contingent consideration of which 56 million was associated with the valuation as of the 2011 acquisition date and the remainder was recognized in cash flows from operations 

we have outstanding senior notes of 4250 million which are not due until 2020 we believe the current cash is sufficient to meet normal operating costs and funding for research and development of new products as well as routine outflows of capital expenditures interest and taxes 

the board of directors has authorized the repurchase of up to 180 million  of biorads common stock of which 33 million  has yet to be repurchased as of december 31 2015  the credit agreement may limit our ability to repurchase our stock in accordance with the terms of awards under the 2007 incentive award plan in june 2012 we withheld 122 shares  of our class a common stock and 917 shares  of our class b common stock to satisfy tax obligations due upon the vesting of restricted stock of certain of our employees which is considered a repurchase of our stock all of the restricted stock vested as of december 31 2013 and therefore we do not anticipate any repurchasing of shares for this purpose we had no other repurchases of our stock during 2015  2014  or 2013  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements that have had or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

contractual obligations 

the following summarizes certain of our contractual obligations as of december 31 2015  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our cash flows in future periods in millions 



recent accounting standards updates 

in february 2016 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued accounting standards update no “asu” 201602 leases which will require among other items lessees to recognize most leases as assets and liabilities on the balance sheet qualitative and quantitative disclosures will be enhanced to better understand the amount timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases asu 201602 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2018 and interim periods within those fiscal years with early adoption permitted asu 201602 will be adopted on a modified retrospective basis with elective reliefs which requires application of asu 201602 for all periods presented we are currently evaluating the effect asu 201602 will have on our consolidated financial statements 

in january 2016 the fasb issued asu 201601 recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities amendments under asu 201601 among other items require that all equity investments in unconsolidated entities other than those accounted for using the equity method of accounting will generally be measured at fair value through earnings there will no longer be an availableforsale classification for which changes in fair value are reported in other comprehensive income for equity securities with readily determinable fair values   for equity investments without readily determinable fair values the cost method is also eliminated however entities will be able to elect to record equity investments without readily determinable fair values at cost less impairment and plus or minus subsequent adjustments for observable price changes changes in the basis of these equity investments will be reported in current earnings asu 201601 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2017 and interim periods within those fiscal years we are currently evaluating the effect asu 201601 will have if any on our consolidated financial statements 

in november 2015 the fasb issued asu 201517 “balance sheet classification of deferred taxes” which requires entities to present deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities as noncurrent for each taxpaying jurisdiction in the balance sheet previous disclosures required entities to separate deferred tax assets and liabilities into a current amount and a noncurrent amount for each taxpaying jurisdiction asu 201517 will be effective for annual periods beginning after december 15 2016 and interim periods within those years asu 201517 can be early adopted for any period that has not been issued on a prospective or retrospective basis we early adopted asu 201517 during the fourth quarter of 2015 on a prospective basis as a change in accounting policy and therefore prior periods were not retrospectively adjusted 

in july 2015 the fasb issued asu 201511 “simplifying the measurement of inventory” under current guidance an entity subsequently measures inventory at the lower of cost or market with market defined as replacement cost net realizable value nrv or nrv less a normal profit margin an entity uses current replacement cost provided that it is not above nrv ie the ceiling or below nrv less an “approximately normal profit margin” ie the floor asu 201511 eliminates this analysis and requires entities to measure most inventory “at the lower of cost and nrv” asu 201511 is effective prospectively for annual periods beginning after december 15 2016 and interim periods therein with early adoption permitted we are currently evaluating the effect asu 201511 will have if any on our consolidated financial statements 

in april 2015 the fasb issued asu 201503 simplifying the presentation of debt issuance costs asu 201503 was issued to simplify the presentation of debt issuance costs by requiring debt issuance costs to be presented as a deduction from the corresponding debt liability this will make the presentation of debt issuance costs consistent with the presentation of debt discounts or premiums under current us gaap debt issuance costs are reported on the balance sheet as assets and amortized as interest expense under asu 201503 debt issuance costs will continue to be amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method in august 2015 the fasb issued asu 201515 presentation and subsequent measurement of debt issuance costs associated with lineofcredit arrangements to clarify the sec staff’s position that it would not object to an entity deferring and presenting debt issuance costs as an asset and subsequently amortizing the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of the lineofcredit arrangement which is our current practice asu 201503 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2015 and interim periods within those fiscal years with early adoption permitted we will not early adopt debt issuance costs were not material as of december 31 2015 

in may 2014 the fasb issued asu 201409 “revenue from contracts with customers” which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers asu 201409 will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in gaap when it becomes effective in august 2015 the fasb issued asu 201514 to defer the effective date for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2017 including interim periods within that reporting period early adoption is permitted as of the original effective date in asu 201409 which is annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2016 however we do not plan to early adopt the new standard is to be applied retrospectively and permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method we are currently evaluating the effect that asu 201409 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures and we have not yet selected a transition method 

item 7a quantitive and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

financial risk management 

the main goal of biorad’s financial risk management program is to reduce the variance in expected cash flows arising from unexpected foreign exchange rate and interest rate changes financial exposures are managed through operational means and by using various financial instruments including cash and liquid resources borrowings and forward and spot foreign exchange contracts no derivative financial instruments are entered into for the purpose of trading or speculation company policy requires that all derivative positions are undertaken to manage the risks arising from underlying business activities these derivative transactions do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment derivative instruments used in these transactions are valued at fair value and changes in fair value are included in reported earnings 

foreign exchange risk   we operate and conduct business in many countries and are exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates we face transactional currency exposures that arise when we enter into transactions denominated in currencies other than us dollars additionally our consolidated net equity is impacted by the conversion of the net assets of our international subsidiaries for which the functional currency is not the us dollar 

foreign currency exposures are managed on a centralized basis this allows for the netting of natural offsets and lowers transaction costs and net exposures where possible we seek to manage our foreign exchange risk in part through operational means including matching samecurrency revenues to samecurrency costs and samecurrency assets to samecurrency liabilities moreover weakening in one currency can often be offset by strengthening in another currency foreign exchange risk is also managed through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts positions are primarily in euro swiss franc british sterling singapore dollar brazilian real and japanese yen the majority of forward contracts are for periods of 90 days or less we record the change in value of our foreign currency receivables and payables as a foreign exchange gain loss on our consolidated statements of income along with the change in fair market value of the forward exchange contract used as an economic hedge of those assets or liabilities 

our forward contract holdings at yearend were analyzed to determine their sensitivity to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates all other variables were held constant market risk associated with derivative holdings is the potential change in fair value of derivative positions arising from an adverse movement in foreign exchange rates a decline of 10 on quoted foreign exchange rates would result in an approximate netpresentvalue loss of 27 million  on our derivative position as of december 31 2015  this impact of a change in exchange rates excludes the offset derived from the change in value of the underlying assets and liabilities which could reduce the adverse effect significantly 

interest rate risk of debt instruments   biorad centrally manages the shortterm cash surpluses and shortfalls of its subsidiaries our holdings of variable rate debt instruments at yearend were analyzed to determine their sensitivity to movements in interest rates due to the relatively small amount of shortterm variable rate debt we have outstanding there would not be a material impact to earnings or cash flows if interest rates moved adversely by 10 our longterm debt consists primarily of fixedrate instruments and is thus insulated from interest rate changes as of december 31 2015  the overall interest rate risk associated with our debt was not significant

tableend

general 

founded in 1952 and incorporated in 1957 biorad laboratories inc referred to in this report as “biorad” “we” “us” and “our” was initially engaged in the development and production of specialty chemicals used in biochemical pharmaceutical and other life science research applications we entered the field of clinical diagnostics with the development of our first test kit based on separation techniques and materials developed for life science research through internal research and development efforts and acquisitions we have expanded into various markets today biorad manufactures and supplies the life science research healthcare analytical chemistry and other markets with a broad range of products and systems used to separate complex chemical and biological materials and to identify analyze and purify their components 

as we broadened our product lines we also expanded our geographical market we have direct distribution channels in over 35 countries outside the united states through subsidiaries whose focus is sales customer service and product distribution in some regions sales efforts are supplemented by distributors and agents 

description of business 

business segments 

today biorad operates in two industry segments designated as life science and clinical diagnostics both segments operate worldwide our life science segment and our clinical diagnostics segment generated 33  and 66  respectively of our net sales for the year ended december 31 2014  we generated approximately 32  of our consolidated net sales for the year ended december 31 2014  from us sales and approximately 68  from sales in our remaining worldwide markets 

for a description of business and financial information on industry and geographic segments see note 14 of item 8 of part ii of this report 

life science segment 

our life science segment is at the forefront of discovery creating advanced tools to answer complex biological questions we are a leader in the life sciences market and develop manufacture and market a range of more than 5000 reagents apparatus and laboratory instruments that serve a global customer base many of our products are used in established research techniques biopharmaceutical production processes and food testing regimes these 

techniques are typically used to separate purify and identify biological materials such as proteins nucleic acids and bacteria within a laboratory or production setting we focus on selected segments of the life sciences market in proteomics the study of proteins genomics the study of genes biopharmaceutical production cell biology and food safety we estimate that the worldwide market for products in these selected segments was approximately 8 billion our principal life science customers include universities and medical schools industrial research organizations government agencies pharmaceutical manufacturers biotechnology researchers food producers and food testing laboratories 

clinical diagnostics segment 

our clinical diagnostics segment designs manufactures sells and supports test systems informatics systems test kits and specialized quality controls that serve clinical laboratories in the global diagnostics market our products currently address specific niches within the in vitro diagnostics ivd test market and we seek to focus on the higher margin higher growth segments of this market 

we supply more than 3000 different products that cover more than 300 clinical diagnostic tests to the ivd test market we estimate that the worldwide sales for products in the markets we serve were approximately 10 billion ivd tests are conducted outside the human body and are used to identify and measure substances in a patient’s tissue blood or urine our products consist of reagents instruments and software typically provided to our customers as an integrated package to allow them to generate reproducible test results revenue in this business is highly recurring as laboratories typically standardize test methodologies which are dependent on a particular supplier’s equipment reagents and consumable products an installed base of diagnostic test systems therefore typically creates an ongoing source of revenue through the sale of test kits for each sample analyzed on an installed system our principal clinical diagnostic customers include hospital laboratories reference laboratories transfusion laboratories and physician office laboratories 

raw materials and components 

we utilize a wide variety of chemicals biological materials electronic components machined metal parts optical parts computing and peripheral devices most of these materials and components are available from numerous sources and generally we have not experienced difficulty in securing adequate supplies however in certain instances we acquire components and materials from a sole supplier due to the regulatory environment in which we operate we may be unable to quickly establish additional or replacement sources for some components or materials 

patents trademarks and licenses 

we own numerous us and international patents and trademarks we also pay royalties on the sales of certain products under several patent license agreements we view these patents trademarks and license agreements as valuable assets however we believe that our ability to develop and manufacture our products depends primarily on our knowledge technology and special skills rather than our patent trademark and licensing positions 

seasonal operations and backlog 

our business is not inherently seasonal however the european custom of concentrating vacation during the summer months usually tempers third quarter sales volume and operating income 

for the most part we operate in markets characterized by short lead times and the absence of significant backlogs management has concluded that backlog information is not material to our business as a whole 

sales and marketing 

we conduct our worldwide operations through an extensive direct sales force and service network employing approximately 740  sales and service people around the world our sales force typically consists of experienced industry practitioners with scientific training and we maintain a separate specialist sales force for each of our segments we believe that this direct sales approach allows us to sell a broader range of our products and have more direct contact with our customers however we also use distributors and agents particularly in many of our international markets 

our customer base is broad and diversified our worldwide customer base includes 1 prominent university and research institutions providing us access to more than 150000 scientists in the united states alone 2 hospital public health and commercial laboratories 3 other leading diagnostic manufacturers and 4 leading companies in the biotechnology pharmaceutical chemical and food industries in 2014  no single customer accounted for more than three  percent of our total net sales our sales are affected by a number of external factors for example a number of our customers particularly in the life science segment are substantially dependent on government grants and research contracts for their funding a significant reduction of government funding has in the past and could in the future have a detrimental effect on the results of this segment 

most of our international sales are generated by our whollyowned subsidiaries and their branch offices certain of these subsidiaries also have manufacturing facilities biorad’s international operations are subject to certain risks common to foreign operations in general such as changes in governmental regulations import restrictions and foreign exchange fluctuations 

competition 

the markets served by our product groups are highly competitive our competitors range in size from startups to large multinational corporations with significant resources and reach we seek to compete primarily in market segments where our products and technology offer customers specific advantages over the competition 

because of the breadth of its product lines our life science segment does not face the same competitors for all of its products competitors in this market include ge biosciences merck millipore and thermo fisher scientific we compete primarily based on meeting performance specifications and offering complete solutions 

major competitors of our clinical diagnostics segment include roche abbott laboratories siemens danaher thermo fisher becton dickinson biomérieux ortho clinical diagnostics tosoh immucor and diasorin

we conduct extensive research and development activities in all areas of our business employing approximately 735  people worldwide in these activities research and development has played a major role in biorad’s growth and is expected to continue to do so in the future our research teams are continuously developing new products and new applications for existing products in our development of new products and applications we interact with scientific and medical professionals at universities hospitals and medical schools and within our industry we spent approximately 2203 million  2110 million  and 2092 million  on research and development activities in 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively 

regulatory matters 

the development testing manufacturing marketing postmarket surveillance distribution advertising and labeling of certain of our products primarily diagnostic products are subject to regulation in the united states by the center for devices and radiological health of the us food and drug administration fda and in other jurisdictions by state and foreign government authorities fda regulations require that some new products have premarketing clearance or approval by the fda and require certain products to be manufactured in accordance with fda’s “good manufacturing practice” regulations to be extensively tested and to be properly labeled to 

disclose test results and performance claims and limitations after a product that is subject to fda regulation is placed on the market numerous regulatory requirements apply including for example the requirement that we comply with recordkeeping and reporting requirements such as the fda’s medical device reporting regulations and reporting of corrections and removals the fda enforces these requirements by inspection and market surveillance the fda has authority to take various administrative and legal actions against us for our or our products’ failure to comply with relevant legal or regulatory requirements including issuing warning letters initiating product seizures requesting or requiring product recalls or withdrawals and other civil or criminal sanctions among other things 

we are also subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business such laws include without limitation state and federal antikickback fraud and abuse false claims privacy and security and physician sunshine laws and regulations if our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to us we may be subject to penalties including without limitation civil and criminal penalties damages fines the curtailment or restructuring of our operations exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results 

sales of our products will depend in part on the extent to which our products or diagnostic tests using our products will be covered by thirdparty payors such as government health care programs commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations these thirdparty payors are increasingly reducing reimbursements for certain medical products and services in addition the us government state legislatures and foreign governments have continued implementing cost containment programs including price controls and restrictions on reimbursement adoption of price controls and costcontainment measures and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures could further limit our net revenue and results decreases in thirdparty reimbursement for our products or diagnostic tests using our products or a decision by a thirdparty payor to not cover our products could reduce or eliminate utilization of our products and have a material adverse effect on our sales results of operations and financial condition in addition healthcare reform measures have been and will be adopted in the future any of which could limit the amounts that governments will pay for healthcare products and services which could result in reduced demand for our products or additional pricing pressures 

as a multinational manufacturer and distributor of sophisticated instrumentation we must meet a wide array of electromagnetic compatibility and safety compliance requirements to satisfy regulations in the united states the european union and other jurisdictions 

our operations are subject to federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations that govern such activities as transportation of goods emissions to air and discharges to water as well as handling and disposal practices for solid hazardous and medical wastes in addition to environmental laws that regulate our operations we are also subject to environmental laws and regulations that create liabilities and cleanup responsibility for spills disposals or other releases of hazardous substances into the environment as a result of our operations or otherwise impacting real property that we own or operate the environmental laws and regulations could also subject us to claims by third parties for damages resulting from any spills disposals or releases resulting from our operations or at any of our properties 

these regulatory requirements vary widely among countries 

employees 

at december 31 2014  biorad had approximately 7600  employees approximately eight  percent of our approximately 3100  us employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement which will expire on november 8 2016 many of our nonus fulltime employees especially in france are covered by collective bargaining agreements we consider our employee relations in general to be good

 item 1a risk factors 

in evaluating our business and whether to invest in any of our securities you should carefully read the following risk factors in addition to the other information contained in this annual report we believe that any of the following risks could have a material effect on our business results of operations or financial condition our industry or the trading price of our common stock we operate in a continually changing business environment and new risks and uncertainties emerge from time to time we cannot predict these new risks and uncertainties nor can we assess the extent to which any such new risks and uncertainties or the extent to which the risks and uncertainties set forth below may adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition our industry or the trading price of our common stock 

our settlement with government agencies in connection with violations by us of the us foreign corrupt practices act could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

as previously disclosed we entered into a nonprosecution agreement npa with the us department of justice doj and the securities and exchange commission sec and consented to the entry of an order by the sec sec order effective november 3 2014 which actions resolved both the doj and the sec investigations into our violations of the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa under the terms of the npa and the sec order we agreed to pay a financial penalty and certain amounts in disgorgement and interest as well as to compliance reporting and cooperation obligations to be performed for two years for additional information regarding this settlement and related legal proceedings see item 3 of this annual report 

we cannot be certain that our remediation efforts will be sufficient to comply with the terms of the npa and the sec order our failure to comply with the npa and the sec order could result in future actions against us by the doj and the sec in addition whether by virtue of announcement of the npa and the sec order or otherwise we may be subject to investigations by foreign governments or further claims by third parties arising from conduct subject to the investigation or our other international operations many of our customers in our significant international operations are government agencies or stateowned or statecontrolled universities hospitals and laboratories the announcement of the npa and the sec order may harm our reputation with these customers which could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

our international operations expose us to additional costs and legal and regulatory risks which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we have significant international operations we have direct distribution channels in over 35 countries outside the united states and in 2014 our foreign subsidiaries generated 68  of our net sales compliance with complex foreign and us laws and regulations that apply to our international operations increases our cost of doing business these numerous and sometimes conflicting laws and regulations include among others data privacy requirements labor relations laws tax laws anticompetition regulations import and trade restrictions export requirements us 

laws such as the fcpa and other us federal laws and regulations established by the office of foreign asset control local laws such as the uk bribery act 2010 or other local laws which prohibit corrupt payments to governmental officials or certain payments or remunerations to customers 

given the high level of complexity of these laws there is a risk that we may inadvertently breach some provisions for example through fraudulent or negligent behavior of individual employees our failure to comply with certain formal documentation requirements or otherwise our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate these risks and manage these challenges through policies procedures and internal controls however we have a dispersed international sales organization and we use distributors and agents in many of our international operations this structure makes it more difficult for us to ensure that our international selling operations comply with our global policies and procedures 

  

violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines criminal sanctions against us our officers or our employees requirements to obtain export licenses cessation of business activities in sanctioned countries implementation of compliance programs and prohibitions on the conduct of our business for example and as previously reported in 2014 our selling subsidiary in china was subject to an administrative penalty and disgorgement of profits of 03 million for providing free products pursuant to contractual obligations with customers during 2012 and 2013 which was deemed to be in violation of china’s antiunfair competition law violations of laws and regulations could result in prohibitions on our ability to offer our products in one or more countries and could materially damage our reputation our brand our international expansion efforts our ability to attract and retain employees or our business results of operations and financial condition see also our risk factor regarding government regulations below 

the industries and market segments in which we operate are highly competitive and we may not be able to compete effectively 

the life science and clinical diagnostics markets are each highly competitive some of our competitors have merged and some of our competitors have greater financial resources than we do and are less leveraged than we are making them better equipped to license technologies and intellectual property from third parties or to fund research and development manufacturing and marketing efforts for more information on our competitors see “competition” in item 1 of this annual report moreover competitive and regulatory conditions in many markets in which we operate restrict our ability to fully recover through price increases higher costs of acquired goods and services resulting from inflation and other drivers of cost increases many public tenders have become more competitive due to governments lengthening the commitments of their public tenders to multiple years which reduces the number of tenders in which we can participate annually because the value of these multipleyear tenders is so high our competitors have been more aggressive with their pricing our failure to compete effectively andor pricing pressures resulting from competition could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

we may not be able to grow our business because of our failure to develop new or improved products 

our future growth depends in part on our ability to continue to improve our product offerings and develop and introduce new product lines and extensions that integrate technological advances in particular we may not be able to keep up with changes in the clinical diagnostics industry such as the trend toward molecular diagnostics or pointofcare tests if we are unable to integrate technological advances into our product offerings or to design develop manufacture and market new product lines and extensions successfully and in a timely manner our business results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected we have experienced product launch delays in the past and may do so in the future we cannot assure you that our product and process development efforts will be successful or that new products we introduce will achieve market acceptance failure to launch successful new products or improvements to existing products may cause our products to become obsolete which could harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

our failure to establish and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could result in material misstatements in our financial statements our failure to meet our reporting obligations and cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information which in turn could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline 

maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to produce reliable financial statements in connection with our assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements for the year ended december 31 2013 we identified a material weakness in the design of monitoring controls over operations at certain of our locations both within the united states and overseas as well as a lack of documentation required to operate these controls appropriately although we have remediated this material weakness as of december 31 2014 we cannot assure you that additional material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting will not be identified in the future for example we previously identified different material weaknesses in internal controls at december 31 2012 and december 31 2010 both of which have been remediated 

such material weaknesses have adversely affected us in the past and could affect us in the future and the results of our periodic management evaluations and annual auditor attestation reports regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting required by section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 any failure to maintain new and more precise monitoring controls and improved detection and communication of financial misstatements across all levels of the organization could result in additional material weaknesses result in material misstatements in our financial statements and cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations this could cause us to lose public confidence and could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline for further information regarding our controls and procedures see item 9a of this annual report 

we are subject to foreign currency exchange fluctuations which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

as stated above a significant portion of our operations and sales are outside of the united states when we make purchases and sales in currencies other than the us dollars we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar that may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition our international sales are largely denominated in local currencies as a result the strengthening of the us dollar negatively impacts our consolidated net sales expressed in us dollars in 2014 our consolidated net sales grew by 33  compared to 2013 on a currency neutral basis however due to the strengthening of the us dollar relative to other currencies in which we sell products our consolidated net sales only grew by 20  as reported in us dollars conversely when the us dollar weakens our expenses at our international sites increase in addition the volatility of other currencies such as the swiss franc and russian ruble may negatively impact our operations outside of the united states and increase our costs to hedge against currency fluctuations we cannot assure you that future shifts in currency exchange rates will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition for further information regarding our foreign exchange risk see “foreign currency exchange gains and losses” in item 7 and “foreign exchange risk” in item 7a of this annual report 

recent changes to our organizational structure and executive management team could negatively impact our business 

we recently made significant changes to our organizational structure we functionalized our manufacturing and selling organizations globally and separated them from our marketing and research and development organizations specifically we combined our international selling organization with our north american selling divisions into one global selling group and consolidated our manufacturing divisions into one global manufacturing group we also created new management positions to head each of these groups in addition we recently appointed new executives to head each of our life science and clinical diagnostics segments and we appointed a chief operating officer we also recently restructured our life science segment based on functional groups rather than product line divisions these changes may have unintended consequences such as distraction of our management and 

employees business disruption attrition of our workforce inability to attract or retain key employees and reduced employee morale or productivity 

we may experience difficulties implementing our new global enterprise resource planning system 

we are engaged in a multiyear implementation of a new global enterprise resource planning system erp the erp is designed to efficiently maintain our books and records and provide information important to the operation of our business to our management team the erp will continue to require significant investment of human and financial resources in implementing the erp we may experience significant delays increased costs and other difficulties any significant disruption or deficiency in the design and implementation of the erp could adversely affect our ability to process orders ship product send invoices and track payments fulfill contractual obligations or otherwise operate our business for example we experienced system implementation issues in our clinical diagnostics segment during our first deployment that impacted invoicing and caused an increase in accounts receivable while we have invested significant resources in planning project management and training additional and significant implementation issues may arise in addition our efforts to centralize various business processes and functions within our organization in connection with our erp implementation may disrupt our operations and negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition 

breaches of our information systems could have material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

through our sales and ecommerce channels we collect and store confidential information that customers provide to among other things purchase products or services enroll in promotional programs and register on our web site we also acquire and retain information about suppliers and employees in the normal course of business we also create and maintain proprietary information that is critical to our business such as our product designs and manufacturing processes despite recent initiatives to improve our technology systems such as our enterprise resource planning implementation and the centralization of our global information technology organization we could experience a significant data security breach computer hackers may attempt to penetrate our or our vendors’ information systems and if successful misappropriate confidential customer supplier employee or other business information such as our intellectual property third parties could also gain control of our systems and use them for criminal purposes while appearing to be us as a result we could lose existing customers have difficulty attracting new customers be exposed to claims from customers financial institutions payment card associations employees and other persons have regulatory sanctions or penalties imposed incur additional expenses or lose revenues as a result of a data privacy breach or suffer other adverse consequences our operations and ability to process sales orders particularly through our ecommerce channels could also be disrupted any significant breakdown intrusion interruption corruption or destruction of our systems as well as any data breaches could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations see also our risk factors regarding our erp implementation above and our information technology systems below 

risks relating to intellectual property rights may negatively impact our business 

we rely on a combination of copyright trade secret patent and trademark laws and thirdparty nondisclosure agreements to protect our intellectual property rights and products however we cannot assure you that our intellectual property rights will not be challenged invalidated circumvented or rendered unenforceable or that meaningful protection or adequate remedies will be available to us for instance unauthorized third parties have attempted to copy our intellectual property reverse engineer or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary or have developed equivalent technologies independently and may do so in the future additionally third parties have asserted patent copyright and other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to us and may do so in the future if we are unable to license or otherwise access protected technology used in our products or if we lose our rights under any existing licenses we could be prohibited from manufacturing and marketing such products from time to time we also must enforce our patents or other intellectual property rights or defend ourselves against claimed infringement of the rights of others through litigation as a result we could incur substantial costs be forced to redesign our products or be required to pay damages to an infringed party any of the foregoing matters could adversely impact our business results of operations and financial condition 

global economic conditions could continue to adversely affect our operations 

in recent years we have been faced with very challenging global economic conditions further deterioration in the global economic environment may result in decreased demand for our products increased competition downward pressure on the prices for our products and longer sales cycles a weakening of macroeconomic conditions may also adversely affect our suppliers which could result in interruptions in supply in the future we have also experienced delays in collecting receivables in certain countries in western europe and we may experience similar delays in these and other countries or regions experiencing liquidity problems as of december 31 2014 we had accounts receivable net of allowance for doubtful accounts in spain italy greece and portugal of 454 million  in addition a slowing of growth in the chinese economy and in emerging markets especially those oilproducing countries that have been affected by the recent decline in oil prices could adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

reductions in government funding and the capital spending programs of our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

our customers include universities clinical diagnostics laboratories government agencies hospitals and pharmaceutical biotechnology and chemical companies the capital spending programs of these institutions and companies have a significant effect on the demand for our products such programs are based on a wide variety of factors including the resources available to make such purchases the availability of funding from grants by governments or government agencies the spending priorities for various types of equipment and the policies regarding capital expenditures during industry downturns or recessionary periods if government funding to our customers were to decrease or if our customers were to decrease or reallocate their budgets in a manner adverse to us our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially and adversely effected for more information on our customers see “sales and marketing” in item 1 of this annual report 

changes in the healthcare industry could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

there have been and will continue to be significant changes in the healthcare industry in an effort to reduce costs these changes include 

 

 11 

the payments for clinical laboratory services paid under the clfs in addition the protecting access to medicare act of 2014 will make significant changes to the way medicare will pay for clinical laboratory services which will further reduce reimbursement rates 

 

to the extent that the healthcare industry seeks to address the need to contain costs stemming from reform measures such as those contained in the ppaca and the protecting access to medicare act of 2014 or in future legislation by limiting the number of clinical tests being performed or the amount of reimbursement available for such tests our business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected if these changes in the healthcare markets in the united states and europe continue we could be forced to alter our approach in selling marketing distributing and servicing our products 

we are subject to substantial government regulation and any changes in regulation or violations of regulations by us could adversely affect our business prospects results of operations or financial condition 

some of our products primarily our clinical diagnostic products production processes and marketing are subject to us federal state and local and foreign regulation including by the fda in the united states and its foreign counterparts the fda regulates our clinical diagnostic products as medical devices and we are subject to significant regulatory clearances or approvals to market our clinical diagnostic products and other requirements including for example recordkeeping and reporting requirements such as the fda’s medical device reporting regulations and reporting of corrections and removals the fda has broad regulatory and enforcement powers if the fda determines that we have failed to comply with applicable regulatory requirements it can impose a variety of enforcement actions ranging from public warning letters fines injunctions consent decrees and civil penalties to suspension or delayed issuance of approvals seizure or recall of our products total or partial shutdown of production withdrawal of approvals or clearances already granted and criminal prosecution the fda can also require us to repair replace or refund the cost of devices that we manufactured or distributed 

in addition the fda may change its clearance and approval policies adopt additional regulations or revise existing regulations or take other actions which may prevent or delay approval or clearance of our products or impact our ability to modify our currently approved or cleared products on a timely basis changes in the fda’s review of certain clinical diagnostic products referred to as laboratory developed tests which are tests developed by a single laboratory for use only in that laboratory could affect some of our customers who use our life science instruments for laboratory developed tests in the past the fda has chosen to not enforce applicable regulations and has not reviewed such tests for approval however the fda has recently issued guidance that it will begin enforcing its medical device requirements including premarket submission requirements to such tests any delay in or failure to receive or maintain clearance or approval for our products could prevent us from generating revenue from these products and adversely affect our business operations and financial results additionally the fda and other regulatory authorities have broad enforcement powers regulatory enforcement or inquiries or other increased scrutiny on us could affect the perceived safety and efficacy of our products and dissuade our customers from using our products 

many foreign governments have similar rules and regulations regarding the importation registration labeling sale and use of our products such agencies may also impose new requirements that may require us to modify or reregister products already on the market or otherwise impact our ability to market our products in those countries for example europe is currently making its regulations for product labeling stricter russia has recently enacted more stringent medical product registration regulations and we expect china brazil and india to impose more regulations that impact our product registrations increasing protectionism in such countries also impedes our ability to compete with local companies for example we may not be able to participate in certain public tenders in russia because of increasing measures to restrict access to such tenders for companies without local manufacturing capabilities specifically a resolution passed by russia in february 2015 prohibits the procurement of certain types of medical devices by russian state entities from foreign companies provided there are a sufficient number of 

russian manufacturers submitting tenders such regulations could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

we are also subject to government regulation of the use and handling of a number of materials and controlled substances the us drug enforcement administration establishes registration security recordkeeping reporting storage distribution and other requirements for controlled substances pursuant to the controlled substances act of 1970 failure to comply with present or future laws and regulations could result in substantial liability to us suspension or cessation of our operations restrictions on our ability to expand at our present locations or require us to make significant capital expenditures or incur other significant expenses 

we cannot assure you that we will be able to integrate acquired companies products or technologies into our company successfully or we may not be able to realize the anticipated benefits from the acquisitions 

as part of our overall business strategy we pursue acquisitions of and investments in complementary companies products and technologies for information about our recent acquisitions see overview in item 7 of this annual report in order to be successful in these activities we must among other things 

 

the benefits of any acquisition may prove to be less than anticipated and may not outweigh the costs reported in our financial statements completing any potential future acquisitions could cause significant diversion of our management’s time and resources if we acquire new companies products or technologies we may be required to assume contingent liabilities or record impairment charges for goodwill and other intangible assets over time we cannot assure you that we will successfully overcome these risks or any other problems we encounter in connection with any acquisitions and any such acquisitions could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

product quality and liability issues could harm our reputation and negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition 

we must adequately address quality issues associated with our products including defects in our engineering design and manufacturing processes as well as defects in thirdparty components included in our products our instruments reagents and consumables are complex and identifying the root cause of quality issues especially those affecting reagents or thirdparty components is difficult we may incur significant costs and expend substantial time in researching and remediating such issues quality issues could also delay our launching of new products in addition quality issues unapproved uses of our products or inadequate disclosure of risks related to our products could result in product recalls or product liability or other claims being brought against us these issues could harm our reputation impair our relationship with existing customers and harm our ability to attract new customers which could negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition 

lack of key personnel could hurt our business 

our products are very technical in nature in general only highly qualified and welltrained scientists have the necessary skills to develop market and sell our products and many of our manufacturing positions require very specialized knowledge and skills in addition the global nature of our business also requires that we have sophisticated and experienced staff to comply with increasingly complex international laws and regulations we face intense competition for these professionals from our competitors customers marketing partners and other companies throughout our industry in particular the job market in northern california where many of our employees are located has improved significantly if we do not offer competitive compensation and benefits we may fail to retain or attract a sufficient number of qualified personnel which could impair our ability to properly run our business 

in some cases we rely on temporary personnel or consultants and we may do so in the future such temporary personnel or consultants may lack the knowledge andor specific skills necessary for our business require time to train without benefiting us through extended employment and increase our costs in addition as noted above our strategic initiatives such our internal restructuring and erp implementation may be burdensome and disruptive and lead to employee dissatisfaction and attrition 

a reduction or interruption in the supply of components and raw materials could adversely affect our manufacturing operations and related product sales 

the manufacture of many of our products requires the timely delivery of sufficient amounts of quality components and materials we manufacture our products in numerous manufacturing facilities around the world we acquire our components and materials from many suppliers in various countries we work closely with our suppliers to ensure the continuity of supply but we cannot guarantee these efforts will always be successful further while we seek to diversify our sources of components and materials in certain instances we acquire components and materials from a sole supplier in addition due to the regulatory environment in which we operate we may be unable to quickly establish additional or replacement sources for some components or materials if our supply is reduced or interrupted and we are unable to develop alternative sources for such supply our ability to manufacture our products in a timely or costeffective manner could be adversely affected which would adversely affect our ability to sell our products 

if our information technology systems are disrupted or if we fail to successfully implement manage and integrate our information technology and reporting systems our business results of operations and financial condition could be harmed 

our information technology it systems are an integral part of our business and a serious disruption of our it systems could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition we depend on our it systems to process orders manage inventory and collect accounts receivable our it systems also allow us to efficiently purchase products from our suppliers and ship products to our customers on a timely basis maintain costeffective operations and provide customer service we cannot assure you that our contingency plans will allow us to operate at our current level of efficiency 

our ability to implement our business plan in a rapidly evolving market requires effective planning reporting and analytical processes we expect that we will need to continue to improve and further integrate our it systems reporting systems and operating procedures by training and educating our employees with respect to these improvements and integrations on an ongoing basis in order to effectively run our business we may suffer interruptions in service loss of data or reduced functionality when we upgrade or change systems if we fail to successfully manage and integrate our it systems reporting systems and operating procedures it could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition see also our risk factors regarding our erp implementation and data security above 

natural disasters terrorist attacks acts of war or other events beyond our control may cause damage or disruption to us and our employees facilities information systems security systems vendors and customers which could significantly impact our business results of operations and financial condition 

we have significant manufacturing and distribution facilities including in the western united states france switzerland germany and singapore in particular the western united states has experienced a number of earthquakes wildfires floods landslides and other natural disasters in recent years these occurrences could damage or destroy our facilities which may result in interruptions to our business and losses that exceed our insurance coverage in addition strikes or other labor unrest at any of our sites or surrounding areas could cause disruption to our business for example we have experienced some delays in our supply of raw materials and shipments of products to customers due to recent labor unrest at the seaports in the western united states if the situation continues or worsens we may experience further disruption of our business or increased costs as we rely more on air freight acts of terrorism bioterrorism violence or war could also affect the markets in which we operate our business operations and strategic plans political unrest may affect our sales in certain regions such as in southeast asia the middle east and eastern europe in particular the recent political turmoil in ukraine along with the response of the russian and us governments to this situation has the potential to impact our operations in russia any of these events could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

environmental health and safety regulations and enforcement proceedings may negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition 

our operations are subject to federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations that govern such activities as transportation of goods emissions to air and discharges to water as well as handling and disposal practices for solid hazardous and medical wastes in addition to environmental laws that regulate our operations we are also subject to environmental laws and regulations that create liability and cleanup responsibility for spills disposals or other releases of hazardous substances into the environment as a result of our operations or otherwise impacting real property that we own or operate the environmental laws and regulations also subject us to claims by third parties for damages resulting from any spills disposals or releases resulting from our operations or at any of our properties we must also comply with various health and safety regulations in the united states and abroad in connection with our operations 

we may in the future incur capital and operating costs to comply with currently existing laws and regulations and possible new statutory enactments and these expenditures may be significant we have incurred and may in the future incur fines related to environmental matters andor liability for costs or damages related to spills or other releases of hazardous substances into the environment at sites where we have operated or at offsite locations where we have sent hazardous substances for disposal we cannot assure you however that such matters or any future obligations to comply with environmental or health and safety laws and regulations will not adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

we may be subject to additional tax liabilities 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and many foreign jurisdictions we calculate our provision for income taxes in each jurisdiction in which we operate significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and in the ordinary course of business there are many tax positions taken where the ultimate resolution is uncertain we are subject to the examination of our tax positions in the united states and many other foreign jurisdictions taxing authorities have disagreed with our judgment in the past and may disagree with positions we take in the future resulting in assessments of additional taxes economic and political pressures to increase tax revenues in various jurisdictions may make resolving tax disputes more difficult for example in recent years the tax authorities in europe have disagreed with our tax positions related to hybrid debt research and development credits transfer pricing and indirect taxes among others we regularly assess the likelihood of the outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals the results of an 

audit or litigation could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements in the period or periods for which that determination is made changes in factors outside of our control such as changes in tax laws or rates changes in the interpretation of tax laws or changes in the jurisdictional mix of our earnings could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations 

our debt may restrict our future operations 

we have substantial debt and have the ability to incur additional debt as of december 31 2014 we had approximately 4360 million  of outstanding indebtedness in addition we have a revolving credit facility that provides for up to 2000 million  50 million  of which has been utilized for domestic standby letters of credit our incurrence of substantial amounts of debt may have important consequences for instance it could 

 

our existing credit facility and the terms of our other debt instruments including agreements we may enter in the future contain or will contain covenants imposing significant restrictions on our business these restrictions may affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise these covenants place restrictions on our ability to among other things incur additional debt acquire other businesses or assets through merger or purchase create liens make investments enter into transactions with affiliates sell assets in the case of some of our subsidiaries guarantee debt and declare or pay dividends redeem stock or make other distributions to stockholders our existing credit facility also requires that we comply with certain financial ratios including a maximum consolidated leverage ratio test and a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio test 

our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control including prevailing economic financial and industry conditions the breach of any of these restrictions could result in a default an event of default under our debt agreements would permit some of our lenders to declare all amounts borrowed from them to be due and payable together with accrued and unpaid interest in addition acceleration of our other indebtedness may cause us to be unable to make interest payments on our outstanding notes and repay the principal amount of our outstanding notes or may cause the future subsidiary guarantors if any to be unable to make payments under the guarantees 

we are subject to healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations and could face substantial penalties if we are unable to fully comply with such laws 

we are subject to healthcare fraud and abuse regulation and enforcement by both the us federal government and the us states and foreign governments in which we conduct our business these healthcare laws and regulations include for example 

 16 

 

 

 

 

these laws will continue to impose administrative cost and compliance burdens on us the shifting compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust systems to comply with multiple jurisdictions with different compliance andor reporting requirements increases the possibility that a healthcare company may violate one or more of these requirements in addition any action against us for violation of these laws even if we successfully defend against it could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business if our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us we may be subject to penalties including civil and criminal penalties damages fines exclusion from the medicare and medicaid programs and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business results of operations and financial condition 

we may incur losses in future periods due to writedowns in the value of financial instruments 

we have positions in a variety of financial instruments including asset backed securities and other similar instruments financial markets are quite volatile and the markets for these securities can be illiquid the value of these securities will continue to be impacted by external market factors including default rates changes in the value of the underlying property such as residential or commercial real estate rating agency actions the prices at which observable market transactions occur and the financial strength of various entities such as financial guarantors who provide insurance for the securities should we need to convert these positions to cash we may not be able to sell these instruments without significant losses due to current debtor financial conditions or other market considerations 

regulations related to “conflict minerals” could adversely impact our business 

as part of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the sec adopted disclosure requirements regarding the use of certain minerals known as conflict minerals which are mined from the democratic republic of congo drc and adjoining countries as well as procedures regarding a manufacturers efforts to identify the sourcing of such minerals and metals produced from those minerals the european union is considering additional reporting obligations we have incurred and will continue to incur additional costs in order to comply with the sec’s disclosure requirements in addition we might incur further costs due to possible changes to our products processes or sources of supply as a consequence of our due diligence activities as our supply chain is complex we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins of the specified minerals used in our products through our due diligence procedures which may harm our reputation in addition we may encounter challenges to satisfy those customers who require that all of the components of our products be certified as “drc conflict free” which could place us at a competitive disadvantage if we do not do so we filed our report for the calendar year 2013 with the sec on may 30 2014 

risks related to our common stock 

  

a significant majority of our voting stock is held by the schwartz family which could lead to conflicts of interest 

we have two classes of voting stock class a common stock and class b common stock with a few exceptions holders of class a and class b common stock vote as a single class when voting as a single class each share of class a common stock is entitled to onetenth of a vote while each share of class b common stock has one vote in the election or removal of directors the classes vote separately and the holders of class a common stock are entitled to elect 25 of the board of directors with holders of class b common stock electing the remaining directors 

as of february 17 2015 the schwartz family collectively held approximately 15  of our class a common stock and 94  of our class b common stock as a result the schwartz family is able to elect a majority of the directors effect fundamental changes in our direction and control matters affecting us including the determination of business opportunities that may be suitable for our company the schwartz family may exercise its control over us according to interests that are different from other investors’ or debtors’ interests in particular this concentration of ownership and voting power may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

this discussion should be read in conjunction with the information contained in our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes which are an integral part of the statements 

overview  we are a multinational manufacturer and worldwide distributor of our own life science research and clinical diagnostics products our business is organized into two primary segments life science and clinical diagnostics with the mission to provide scientists with specialized products needed for biological research and clinical diagnostics 

we sell more than 8000 products and services to a diverse client base comprised of scientific research healthcare education and government customers worldwide we do not disclose quantitative information about our different products and services as it is impractical to do so based primarily on the numerous products and services that we sell and the global markets that we serve 

we manufacture and supply our customers with a range of reagents apparatus and equipment to separate complex chemical and biological materials and to identify analyze and purify components because our customers require standardization for their experiments and test results much of our revenues are recurring 

we are impacted by the support of many governments for both research and healthcare the current global economic outlook is still uncertain as the need to control government social spending by many governments limits opportunities for growth approximately 32  of our 2014  consolidated net sales are derived from the united states and approximately 68  are derived from international locations with europe being our largest region overall the international sales are largely denominated in local currencies such as the euro swiss franc japanese yen chinese yuan and british sterling as a result our consolidated net sales expressed in dollars benefit when the us dollar weakens and suffer when the dollar strengthens when the us dollar strengthens we benefit from lower cost of sales from our own international manufacturing sites as well as nonus suppliers and from lower international operating expenses 

as previously disclosed in may 2010 we voluntarily disclosed to the us department of justice doj and the securities and exchange commission sec certain likely or potential violations of the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa effective november 3 2014 we entered into a nonprosecution agreement npa with the doj and consented to the entry of an order by the sec sec order which actions resolve both the doj and sec investigations as a result of the settlements with the doj and the sec during the fourth quarter of 2014 we paid a total of 551 million that included a penalty of 144 million  351 million  in disgorgement and 56 million  in interest 

in april 2014 we acquired 100 of the issued and outstanding stock of gnubio inc gnubio this acquisition was accounted for as a business combination and is included in our clinical diagnostics segments results of operations from the acquisition date the excess of purchase consideration over the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired was recorded as goodwill the fair values assigned to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on management’s estimates and assumptions during the fourth quarter of 2014 we finalized the determination of fair values of certain acquired tax attributes and adjusted the preliminary carrying values of goodwill and certain other assets and liabilities in order to reflect final information received and the finalization of certain tax returns resulting in an overall reduction to goodwill of 17 million  these measurement period adjustments had no impact on our results of operations for the year ending december 31 2014 

the final fair values of the net assets acquired from gnubio as of the acquisition date were determined to be 464 million  of indefinitelived intangible assets specifically inprocess research and development or iprd 135 million  of goodwill and 95 million  of net tangible liabilities the fair value of the consideration as of the 

acquisition date was 504 million  which included 397 million  paid in cash at the closing date and 107 million  in contingent consideration potentially payable to gnubios shareholders the contingent consideration was based on a probabilityweighted income approach that could reach 700 million  upon the achievement of all developmentregulatory and sales milestones the contingent consideration for the developmentregulatory milestones was valued at 107 million  based on assumptions regarding the probability of achieving the milestones with such amounts discounted to present value during the fourth quarter of 2014 the contingent consideration related to the developmentregulatory milestones was revalued to a fair value of 100 million  as of december 31 2014  the contingent consideration for the sales milestones at the acquisition date was determined to be negligible using the riskneutral probability of being in the money based on a blackscholes framework we believe that gnubios innovative dna workflow is wellsuited for the clinical diagnostics sequencing market and will leverage our leadership role in the area of droplet digital pcr 

in january 2013 we acquired 100 of the outstanding shares of abd serotec a division of morphosys ag for total consideration of 622 million net of cash received of 73 million this acquisition was accounted for as a business combination and is included in our life science segments results of operations from the acquisition date the final fair values of the net assets acquired consist of definitelived intangible assets of 440 million goodwill of 149 million and net tangible assets of 33 million we believe that with abd serotecs comprehensive catalog of antibodies we are able to offer our customers total assay solutions that can be validated on many of our research platforms for western blotting multiplex protein expression elisa and cell sorting 

in september 2013 we redeemed all of our 3000 million 80 senior subordinated notes for 3120 million including a call premium of 120 million and expensed the remaining original issuance bond discount of 25 million and unamortized bond issuance costs of 11 million all of which are included in interest expense in our condensed consolidated statements of income 

during the third quarter of 2014 we identified errors in the consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2013 the consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 and for all interim periods therein and in the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets and statements of cash flows as of and for the three months ended march 31 2014 and the three and six months ended june 30 2014 all related to the recorded amounts of inventories and property plant and equipment net during these periods we inappropriately reduced inventories by all of the intercompany profit on intercompany transactions related to certain equipment however a portion of that profit should have reduced capital additions and been reflected in property plant and equipment net the equipment is a biorad product provided to customers under reagent rental agreements whereby biorad retains ownership of the equipment and charges the customer for test kits purchased for use with this equipment depreciation was calculated correctly and there is no impact to net income for any period presented 

the effect of correcting these errors was to increase total inventories and decrease property plant and equipment net at december 31 2013 by 150 million  as a result of this adjustment 53 million  of prepaid income taxes that were included in prepaid expenses on the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2013 were reclassified from shortterm to longterm other assets the overall effect of the adjustments to total inventories and prepaid expenses increased total current assets by 96 million  these adjustments did not change total assets 

the associated reclassification entries within the statements of cash flows were to increase cash paid to suppliers and employees and decrease capital expenditures by 63 million  and 95 million  for the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively these reclassifications resulted in a decrease in net cash provided by operating activities and a decrease in net cash used in investing activities by 63 million  and 95 million  for the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively there was no change to the net increase or decrease in cash and cash equivalents for any period presented 

management evaluated the materiality of the errors described above from a qualitative and quantitative perspective in accordance with the requirements of the securities and exchange commission sec staff accounting bulletin no 99 materiality sab 99 based on such evaluation we have concluded that while these errors were 

significant to the periods impacted their correction would not be material to any individual prior period nor did they have an effect on financial results accordingly we are correcting these errors in every affected period in our consolidated financial statements 

during the third quarter of 2012 we recognized a contingent consideration liability of 446 million  upon our acquisition of a new cell sorting system from propel labs inc the fair value of the contingent consideration was based on a probabilityweighted income approach related to the achievement of certain development and sales milestones the development milestone was achieved and paid in 2013 in the third quarter of 2014 the first sales milestone was reached with cell sorting system purchase orders resulting in a payment of 24 million  in the fourth quarter of 2014 effective as of december 31 2014  we have amended certain key terms impacting the future payment of contingent consideration on the acquisition of the new cell sorting system from propel labs inc these include a clarification of the performance period to include an additional four  months and the seller agreeing to support an expansion of our offerings to address the request from customers for customization the amended sales milestones range from 39  of annual invoices for the 2015 and 2016 annual calendar year performance periods to 40  for the extended september 1 2013 to december 31 2014 performance period the contingent consideration was revalued by a net reduction of 07 million  in 2014 to selling general and administrative expense to its estimated fair value of 177 million  as of december 31 2014  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the accompanying discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities and contingencies as of the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis we base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources however future events may cause us to change our assumptions and estimates which may require adjustment actual results could differ from these estimates we have determined that for the periods reported in this annual report on form 10k the following accounting policies and estimates are critical in understanding our financial condition and results of operations 

accounting for income taxes   management is required to make estimates related to our income tax provision in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate this process involves estimating our current tax exposures as well as making judgments regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets in each jurisdiction deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect the tax effects of losses credits and temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes management assesses the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent management believes that recovery is not likely a valuation allowance must be established to the extent management establishes a valuation allowance or increases this allowance in a period an increase to expense within the provision for income taxes in the consolidated statements of income may result 

we have recorded a valuation allowance of 586 million  and 640 million  as of december 31 2014  and 2013  respectively due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize some of the deferred tax assets primarily consisting of certain foreign net operating losses carried forward the valuation allowance is based on management’s current estimates of taxable income for the jurisdictions in which we operate and the period over which the deferred tax assets will be recoverable in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or these estimates are adjusted in future periods an additional valuation allowance may need to be established which would increase the tax provision lowering income and impacting our financial position should realization of these deferred tax assets for which a valuation allowance has been provided occur the provision for income taxes may decrease raising income and positively impacting biorad’s financial position 

we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements on a particular tax position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon settlement the amount of unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted as appropriate for changes in facts and circumstances such as significant amendments to existing tax law new regulations or interpretations by the taxing authorities new information obtained during a tax examination or resolution of an examination we recognize both accrued interest and penalties where appropriate related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense our overall effective tax rate is subject to fluctuations because of changes in the geographic mix of earnings changes to statutory tax rates and tax laws and because of the impact of various tax audits and assessments as well as generation of tax credits 

valuation of goodwill and longlived assets   goodwill represents the excess of the cost over the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses goodwill amounts are assigned to reporting units at the time of acquisition and are adjusted for any subsequent significant transfers of business between reporting units we assess the impairment of goodwill annually in the fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable we perform the impairment tests of goodwill at our reporting unit level which is one level below our operating segments the goodwill impairment test consists of a twostep process the first step of the goodwill impairment test used to identify potential impairment compares the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is not required the second step if required compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill the fair value of a reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the price paid to acquire the reporting unit if the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill exceeds its implied fair value an impairment charge is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 

we use a projected discounted cash flow model to determine the fair value of a reporting unit this discounted cash flow method for determining goodwill may be different from the fair value that would result from an actual transaction between a willing buyer and a willing seller projections such as discounted cash flow models are inherently uncertain and accordingly actual future cash flows may differ materially from projected cash flows management judgment is required in developing the assumptions for the discounted cash flow model these assumptions include revenue growth rates profit margins future capital expenditures working capital needs expected foreign currency rates discount rates and terminal values we estimate future cash flows using current and longerterm high level financial forecasts these forecasts take into account the current economic environment the discount rates used are compiled using independent sources current trends in similar businesses and other observable market data changes to these rates might result in material changes in the valuation and determination of the recoverability of goodwill for example an increase in the discount rate used to discount cash flows will decrease the computed fair value 

we have not identified any events that lead us to believe that goodwill is impaired however impairment tests are highly sensitive to changes in assumptions and minor changes to assumptions that could result in impairment losses our forecasts utilized in our 2014 impairment test assumed among other things sales growth from executing our sales and marketing programs new product introductions successful product development and timely registration of our products when required while controlling costs in addition external factors such as currency inflation rates and cost of capital could affect the determination of fair value of our business units our impairment tests resulted in excessive fair value over book value ranging from 17 to more than 200 for our various business units two of our business units had an excess of 17 and 28 respectively if the initiatives mentioned above do not achieve the desired results or external factors change detrimentally future impairment losses may occur 

to validate the reasonableness of the reporting unit fair values we reconcile the aggregate fair values of the reporting units to the enterprise market capitalization in performing the reconciliation we may depending on the volatility of the market value of our stock price use either the stock price on the valuation date or the average stock price over a range of dates around the valuation date 

for purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment loss a longlived asset or assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities we assess the impairment of longlived assets including identifiable intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable factors that we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include 

 

when management determines that the carrying value of longlived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment we test for any impairment based on a projected undiscounted cash flow method projected future operating results and cash flows of the asset or asset group are used to establish the fair value used in evaluating the carrying value of longlived and intangible assets we estimate the future cash flows of the longlived assets using current and longterm financial forecasts the carrying amount of a longlived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset if this is the case an impairment loss would be recognized the impairment loss recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value there were no impairment losses recorded in 2013  and 2012  in 2014 we impaired licenses of a discontinued product line in the amount of 64 million  this impairment charge included 58 million  in cost of goods sold and 06 million  in research and development expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of income 

valuation of inventories   we value inventory at the lower of the actual cost to purchase andor manufacture the inventory or the current estimated net realizable value of the inventory we review inventory quantities on hand and reduce the cost basis of excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on an estimated forecast of product demand production requirements and the quality efficacy and potency of raw materials this review is done on a quarterly basis or if warranted by the circumstances more frequently in addition our industry is characterized by technological change frequent new product development and product obsolescence that could result in an increase in the amount of obsolete inventory quantities on hand our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate and if too high we may have overstated the carrying value of our inventory in the future if inventory is determined to be overvalued we would be required to write down the value of inventory to market and recognize such costs in our cost of goods sold at the time of such determination therefore although we make efforts to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand and perform procedures to safeguard overall inventory quality any significant unanticipated changes in demand technological developments regulations storage conditions or other economic or environmental factors affecting biological materials could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and reported results of operations 

valuation of investments   we regularly review our investments for factors that may indicate that a decline in the fair value of an investment below its carrying value is otherthantemporary some factors considered in evaluating whether or not a decline in fair value is otherthantemporary include our ability and intent to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for a recovery in value the duration and extent to which the fair value has been less than cost and the financial condition and prospects of the issuer such reviews are inherently uncertain in that the value of the investment may not fully recover or may decline further in future periods resulting in realized losses 

warranty reserves   we warrant certain equipment against defects in design materials and workmanship generally for a period of one year upon delivery and on acceptance of that equipment we establish as part of cost of goods sold a provision for the expected costs of such warranty repairs based on historical experience specific warranty terms and customer feedback a review is performed on a quarterly basis to assess the adequacy of our warranty reserve and it is adjusted if necessary the warranty reserve is based on actual experience and expected future costs to be incurred should realized costs be higher than expected costs cost of goods sold would be lower in the period of estimation and higher when realized 

allowance for doubtful accounts   we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the collectability of our customer accounts the amount of the allowance is determined by analyzing known uncollectible accounts the age of our receivables economic conditions in the customers’ country or industry historical losses and our customers’ general creditworthiness amounts later determined and specifically identified to be uncollectible are charged or written off against this allowance uncertainty in the current economic environment if prolonged could result in greater amounts becoming uncollectible in the future should the estimates of losses be higher than the actual uncollectible accounts we would report lower profitability when the estimates are made and higher profitability when the receivable is collected 

litigation accruals   we record as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets estimated amounts for claims that are probable and can be reasonably estimated the likelihood of a material change in these estimated liabilities is dependent on the possible outcome of settlement negotiations regulatory or judicial review and the development of facts and circumstances in extended litigation which could change claims or assessments when both the amount and range of loss on some outstanding litigation is uncertain we disclose in the footnotes of the financial statements when we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of a material liability that could result from unfavorable outcomes in litigation as events occur we will assess the potential liability related to our pending litigation and revise our estimates such revisions could materially impact our results of operations 

results of operations  sales gross margins and expenses 

the following shows cost of goods sold gross profit expense items and net income as a percentage of net sales 



net sales 

n et sales sales in 2014  were 218 billion  an increase of 20  compared to 213 billion  in 2013  excluding the impact of foreign currency 2014  sales increased by approximately 33  compared to 2013  currency neutral sales growth was reflected in most regions primarily in the united states the emerging markets of eastern europe and china while currency neutral sales in japan decreased 

the life science segment sales in 2014  were 7283 million  an increase of 26  compared to 2013  on a currency neutral basis sales increased 40  compared to 2013  the currency neutral sales increase was reflected across most product lines except for protein separations products currency neutral sales growth was primarily in north america europe and china partially offset by decreased sales in the rest of asia 

the clinical diagnostics segment sales in 2014  were 143 billion  an increase of 17  compared to 2013  on a currency neutral basis sales increased 29  compared to 2013  clinical diagnostics had growth across most product lines on a currency neutral basis most notably from quality control products and blood typing sales growth was partially offset by lower sales for infectious disease in the serology product line primarily due to laboratory consolidation and pricing pressure in europe and north america    currency neutral sales growth was primarily in eastern europe and china partially offset by decreased sales in western europe 

n et sales sales in 2013 were 213 billion compared to 207 billion in 2012 excluding the impact of foreign currency 2013 sales increased by approximately 39 compared to 2012 currency neutral sales growth was reflected in most regions primarily in the americas the emerging markets of eastern europe and the pacific rim while currency neutral sales in western europe decreased 

the life science segment sales in 2013 were 7100 million an increase of 31 compared to 2012 on a currency neutral basis sales increased 45 compared to 2012 the sales increase was primarily driven by sales from the newly acquired abd serotec our droplet digital™ pcr and cell biology product lines currency neutral sales increased in europe and the americas while asia declined a government austerity program had slowed japanese market growth 

the clinical diagnostics segment sales in 2013 were 141 billion an increase of 31 compared to 2012 on a currency neutral basis sales increased 36 compared to 2012 clinical diagnostics had growth across most product lines on a currency neutral basis most notably from quality controls diabetes and bioplex® 2200 system currency neutral sales growth was primarily in eastern europe china asia pacific and the americas while currency neutral sales in western europe declined 

gross margin 

consolidated gross margins were 542  in 2014  compared to 553  in 2013  life science segment gross margins in 2014  decreased from 2013  by approximately 01 percentage points  essentially flat compared to 2013 lower margins were reflected in protein separation products and approximately 17 million of costs associated with the closing of a small manufacturing plant which were almost entirely offset by higher margins in process chromatography droplet digital™ pcr and food testing products clinical diagnostics segment gross margins in 2014  decreased from 2013  by approximately 15 percentage points  the decrease primarily reflected approximately 83 million associated with the discontinuance of a product line in 2014 that was coupled with an increase in inventory reserves and the writedown of licenses for specific technology the decrease was also due to continued pricing pressure approximately 16 million associated with closing and consolidating two small manufacturing plants in 2014 and increased scrap for obsolete products 

beginning in 2013 the patient protection and affordable health care and the health care and education reconciliation acts of 2010 among other initiatives provided for a 23 annual excise tax on the sales of certain medical devices in the us biorad was required to pay this excise tax on most of our us clinical diagnostic sales which we accounted for as a period cost in cost of goods sold 

consolidated gross margins were 553 in 2013 compared to 558 in 2012 life science segment gross margins in 2013 increased from 2012 by approximately 05 percentage points primarily due to an incremental royalty accrual related to a dispute with a third party as well as a 38 million soil remediation expense associated with a manufacturing plant both of which occurred in 2012 the increase was partially offset by an increase in costs related to inventory sold with a higher cost due to purchase accounting and an increase in purchased intangibles amortization expense of 61 million primarily related to the abd serotec and cell sorting system acquisitions clinical diagnostics segment gross margins in 2013 decreased from 2012 by approximately 12 percentage points primarily due to some large low margin government tenders a less favorable product mix and an increase in obsolescence charges gross margins also decreased by approximately 036 due to the excise tax on the sales of certain medical devices in the us that went into effect in 2013 clinical diagnostics segment lower gross margins 

were partially offset by a foreign supplemental tax associated with social benefits of 41 million that occurred in 2012 and a 06 million french competitiveness tax credit that was recorded in 2013 

selling general and administrative expense 

consolidated selling general and administrative expenses sga represented 372  of sales in 2014  compared to 374  of sales in 2013  decreases in sga expense relative to sales were primarily driven by 

 

partially offsetting these decreased costs were 

 44 million 

 

consolidated selling general and administrative expenses sga represented 374 of sales in 2013 compared to 329 of sales in 2012 increases in sga expense relative to sales were primarily driven by 

 

research and development expense 

research and development expense increased to 2203 million  or 101  of sales in 2014  compared to 2110 million  or 99  of sales in 2013  life science segment research and development expense decreased slightly in 2014  from 2013  primarily due to projects nearing completion clinical diagnostics segment research and development expense increased in 2014  from 2013  primarily due to continued investments in diagnostic applications using the recently acquired droplet digital pcr technology and new instrument platforms and assays 

the increase also reflected approximately 31 million associated with the discontinuance of a product line in 2014 that included contractual costs and the writedown of equipment and licenses 

research and development expense increased to 2110 million or 99 of sales in 2013 compared to 

2092 million or 101 of sales in 2012 life science segment research and development expense decreased in 2013 from 2012 primarily due to projects nearing completion clinical diagnostics segment research and development expense increased in 2013 from 2012 primarily due to lower refundable french rd tax credits and a broadening of ongoing development across a wider range of products 

results of operations – nonoperating 

interest expense 

interest expense in 2014 decreased 639  to 221 million  compared to 2013 primarily due to the absence of interest expense of 187 million and 156 million associated with a call premium and expensing the remaining original bond discount and unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the 3000 million principal amount of senior subordinated notes 80 notes which were redeemed on september 30 2013 in addition interest expense in connection with reaching our final settlement with the sec and doj investigations relating to the fcpa was 06 million for 2014 compared to 50 million for 2013 

interest expense in 2013 increased 199 to 613 million compared to 2012 primarily due to the early redemption of our 80 notes on september 30 2013 resulting in a 156 million expense the redemption included a call premium of 120 million the expensing of 25 million of the remaining original issuance bond discount and the expensing of unamortized debt issuance costs of 11 million in addition interest expense included an expense of 50 million of interest expense associated with our initial efforts to resolve the doj and sec investigations relating to the fcpa that was recorded in the latter half of 2013 the increase was partially offset by estimated interest expense of 12 million included in the first quarter of 2012 that was associated with a foreign supplemental tax related to social benefits and interest on back royalties in 2012 

  

foreign currency exchange gains and losses 

foreign currency exchange gains and losses consist of foreign currency transaction gains and losses on intercompany net receivables and payables and the change in fair value of our forward foreign exchange contracts used to manage our foreign currency exchange risk net foreign currency exchange losses for 2014  2013  and 2012  were 93 million  86 million  and 50 million  respectively the 2014  2013  and 2012  net foreign currency exchange losses were attributable to market volatility increasing costs to hedge and the result of the estimating process inherent in the timing of shipments and payments of intercompany debt all years are affected by the economic hedging program we employ to hedge our intercompany receivables and payables 

other income and expense net 

other income and expense net includes investment and dividend income generally interest income on our cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and long term marketable securities other income expense net in 2014 increased to 130 million  income compared to 128 million  income in 2013 the increase was primarily due to higher dividends than in 2013 and realized gains in 2014 compared to realized losses in 2013 partially offset by lower interest on investment income than in 2013 sales of investments in 2013 were used to provide cash to redeem all of the 3000 million 80 senior subordinated notes 

other income expense net in 2013 decreased to 128 million income compared to 219 million income in 2012 the decrease was primarily due to higher realized gains associated with the sale of equity investments in 2012 compared to realized losses in 2013 and a 2012 gain of 43 million on the sale of a building in our clinical diagnostics segment sales of investments in 2013 were used to provide cash to redeem all of the 3000 million 80 senior subordinated notes 

effective tax rate 

our effective tax rate was 32  31  and 28  in 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively the effective tax rates for 2014 and 2013 are approximately the same the effective tax rate for 2014 includes a lower tax benefit of research tax credits because the effective tax rate for 2013 included a significant tax benefit related to the 2012 us federal research credit which was retroactively reinstated on january 2 2013 the additional tax benefit of research credits in 2013 was offset by an increase in tax liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits and audit settlements in our foreign jurisdictions 

the effective tax rates for all three periods were lower than the us statutory rate primarily due to tax benefits from differences between us and foreign statutory tax rates and research and development tax credits our foreign income is earned primarily in switzerland and france jurisdictions in which we operate that have statutory tax rates that are significantly lower than the us statutory tax rate of 35  include switzerland russia the uk and singapore 

our effective tax rate may be impacted in the future either favorably or unfavorably by many factors including but not limited to changes to statutory tax rates changes in tax laws or regulations tax audits and settlements and generation of tax credits 

liquidity and capital resources 

biorad operates and conducts business globally primarily through subsidiary companies established in the markets in which we trade goods are manufactured in a small number of locations and are then shipped to local distribution facilities around the world our product mix is diversified and certain products compete largely on product efficacy while others compete on price gross margins are generally sufficient to exceed normal operating costs and funding for research and development of new products as well as routine outflows of capital expenditures interest and taxes in addition to the annual positive cash flow from operating activities additional liquidity is readily available via the sale of shortterm investments and access to our 2000 million unsecured credit agreement that we entered into in june 2014 borrowings under the credit agreement are on a revolving basis and can be used to make permitted acquisitions for working capital and for other general corporate purposes we had no outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement as of december 31 2014  however 50 million was utilized for domestic standby letters of credit that reduced our borrowing availability the credit agreement matures in june 2019 

at december 31 2014  we had available 6976 million  in cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments of which approximately 43  was held in our foreign subsidiaries we believe that our holdings of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments in the us and in our foreign subsidiaries are sufficient to meet both the current and longterm needs of our global operations the amount of funds held in the united states can fluctuate due to the timing of receipts and payments in the ordinary course of business and due to other reasons such as businessdevelopment activities as part of our ongoing liquidity assessments we regularly monitor the mix of domestic and foreign cash flows both inflows and outflows repatriation of overseas funds will result in additional us federal and state income tax payments in general it is our practice and intention to indefinitely reinvest the cash generated by our foreign subsidiaries in our foreign subsidiaries operations 

under domestic and international lines of credit we had 2333 million  available for borrowing as of december 31 2014  which was reduced by 76 million  that was utilized for standby letters of credit issued by our banks to support our obligations mostly to meet the deductible amount under insurance policies for our benefit management believes that this availability together with cash flow from operations will be adequate to meet our current objectives for operations research and development capital additions for manufacturing and distribution plant and equipment information technology systems and an acquisition of reasonable proportion to our existing total available capital 

while economic growth is somewhat improving instability still exists in developed nations and in the us which may adversely affect our future results of cash flows demand for our products and services could change more dramatically than in previous years based on activity funding reimbursement constraints and support levels from government universities hospitals and private industry including diagnostic laboratories the need for certain sovereign nations with large annual deficits to curtail spending could lead to slower growth of or even a decline in our business sovereign nations either delaying payment for goods and services or renegotiating their debts could impact our liquidity the situation in these sovereign nations is continuously evolving and we have no greater knowledge of the situation other than what is publicly reported as of december 31 2014  and december 31 2013  we had accounts receivable net of allowance for doubtful accounts in spain italy greece and portugal of 454 million  and 660 million  respectively approximately 120 million  of the decrease from december 31 2013 was from currency in addition to customer payments most notably from spain of approximately 11 million from public agencies in the first quarter of 2014 

cash flows from operations 

net cash provided by operations was 2733 million  1691 million  and 2665 million  in 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively the net increase between 2014  and 2013  of 1042 million  primarily resulted from 

 

the net decrease between 2013 and 2012 of 973 million  primarily resulted from 

 

we regularly review past due receivables to assess the allowance for doubtful accounts and believe net accounts receivable are fully realizable we also routinely review inventory for the impact of obsolescence and changes in market prices caused by the introduction of new products technologies and in government reimbursement policies we expect the first quarter of 2015  cash flows from operations to be lower than the fourth quarter of 2014  as biorad historically has made larger payments for royalties fourth quarter sales commissions to third parties and annual employee bonuses during this period 

cash flows from investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities was 1905 million  and 4004 million  for 2014  and 2012  respectively and net cash provided by investing activities was 09 million  in 2013  purchases of marketable securities and investments and proceeds from sales of marketable securities and investments were both lower in 2014 than 2013 primarily due to sales of securities to provide cash to redeem the 3000 million 80 senior subordinated notes we therefore expected purchases to decline markedly year over year due to reduced amounts of cash to invest in addition we purchased longer dated securities to take advantage of higher returns on investments and therefore we experienced an additional decline in maturities and redemptions of securities purchases for marketable securities and investments in 2013  were lower than 2012  primarily due to reallocating funds proceeds from the sale of marketable securities and investments was higher in 2013  than 2012  primarily to provide cash to redeem all of the 3000 million 80 senior subordinated notes 

our investment objective is to maintain liquidity to meet anticipated operational and other corporate requirements in which capital is preserved and increased through investing in low risk high quality securities with commensurate returns consistent with our risk tolerance level 

purchases of intangible assets were higher in 2014 than in 2013 and 2012 primarily due to the purchases of licenses payments for acquisitions net of cash received and longterm investments in 2014 2013 and 2012 were primarily due to the following 

 

we continue to review possible acquisitions to expand both our life science and clinical diagnostics segments we routinely meet with the principals or brokers of the subject companies it is not certain at this time that any of these discussions involving material or significant acquisitions will advance to completion 

capital expenditures in 2014  totaled 1210 million  compared to 1067 million  and 1429 million  in 2013  and 2012  respectively capital expenditures represent the addition and replacement of production machinery and research equipment ongoing manufacturing and facility additions for expansion regulatory environmental and compliance also included in capital expenditures are investments in business systems and data communication upgrades and enhancements all periods include equipment placed with clinical diagnostics segment customers who then contract to purchase our reagents for use capital expenditures were higher in 2014  and 2012 as we were in the development stages in which costs are capitalized of implementing the second and first phases respectively of a global single instance erp platform in april 2013 we implemented the first phase of the global single instance erp platform and hence for the remainder of 2013 costs were no longer capitalized as we continue to implement more phases of the erp platform and expand our ecommerce platform we expect capital expenditures to continue to remain historically higher for the next four years or more the current estimated global implementation cost for the single instance erp platform will exceed 300 million and is estimated to take approximately four or more years to fully implement 

capital expenditures were lower in 2013  than in 2012  as we placed in service the first phase of a global single instance erp platform in 2013  during 2012 we were largely capitalizing development costs throughout the year 

cash flows from financing activities 

net cash provided by financing activities was 117 million  and 126 million  in 2014  and 2012  respectively and net cash used in financing activities was 3117 million  in 2013  net cash provided by financing activities in 2014 was primarily from proceeds from issuance of our common stock net cash provided by financing activities in 2014 was partially offset by a payment of 24 million to propel labs shareholders in contingent consideration for a sales milestone that was associated with the valuation as of the 2012 acquisition date and the payment of a shortterm borrowing net cash used in financing activities in 2013 was primarily due to the early redemption of the 3000 million of 80 senior subordinated notes on september 30 2013 also in 2013 200 million was paid to propel labs shareholders in contingent consideration of which 199 million was associated with the valuation as of the 2012 acquisition date and the remainder was recognized in cash flows from operations additionally in 2013 60 million was paid to quantalife in contingent consideration of which 56 million was associated with the valuation as of the 2011 acquisition date and the remainder was recognized in cash flows from operations net cash provided in 2012 was primarily from proceeds from issuance of our common stock 

we have outstanding senior notes of 4250 million which are not due until 2020 as indicated above we redeemed all of the senior subordinated notes of 300 million on september 30 2013 we believe the current cash is sufficient to meet normal operating costs and funding for research and development of new products as well as routine outflows of capital expenditures interest and taxes 

the board of directors has authorized the repurchase of up to 180 million  of biorads common stock of which 33 million  has yet to be repurchased as of december 31 2014  the credit agreement may limit our ability to repurchase our stock in accordance with the terms of awards under the 2007 incentive award plan in june 2012 we withheld 122 shares  of our class a common stock and 917 shares  of our class b common stock to satisfy tax obligations due upon the vesting of restricted stock of certain of our employees which is considered a repurchase of our stock all of the restricted stock vested as of december 31 2013 and therefore we do not anticipate any repurchasing of shares for this purpose we had no other repurchases of our stock during 2014  2013  or 2012  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements that have had or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

contractual obligations 

the following summarizes certain of our contractual obligations as of december 31 2014  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our cash flows in future periods in millions 



item 7a quantitive and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

financial risk management 

the main goal of biorad’s financial risk management program is to reduce the variance in expected cash flows arising from unexpected foreign exchange rate and interest rate changes financial exposures are managed through operational means and by using various financial instruments including cash and liquid resources borrowings and forward and spot foreign exchange contracts no derivative financial instruments are entered into for the purpose of trading or speculation company policy requires that all derivative positions are undertaken to manage the risks arising from underlying business activities these derivative transactions do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment derivative instruments used in these transactions are valued at fair value and changes in fair value are included in reported earnings 

foreign exchange risk   we operate and conduct business in many countries and are exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates we face transactional currency exposures that arise when we enter into transactions denominated in currencies other than us dollars additionally our consolidated net equity is impacted by the conversion of the net assets of our international subsidiaries for which the functional currency is not the us dollar 

foreign currency exposures are managed on a centralized basis this allows for the netting of natural offsets and lowers transaction costs and net exposures where possible we seek to manage our foreign exchange risk in part through operational means including matching samecurrency revenues to samecurrency costs and samecurrency assets to samecurrency liabilities moreover weakening in one currency can often be offset by strengthening in another currency foreign exchange risk is also managed through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts positions are primarily in euro swiss franc british sterling singapore dollar brazilian real and japanese yen the majority of forward contracts are for periods of 90 days or less we record the change in value of our foreign currency receivables and payables as a foreign exchange gain loss on our consolidated statements of income 

along with the change in fair market value of the forward exchange contract used as an economic hedge of those assets or liabilities 

our forward contract holdings at yearend were analyzed to determine their sensitivity to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates all other variables were held constant market risk associated with derivative holdings is the potential change in fair value of derivative positions arising from an adverse movement in foreign exchange rates a decline of 10 on quoted foreign exchange rates would result in an approximate netpresentvalue loss of 32 million  on our derivative position as of december 31 2014  this impact of a change in exchange rates excludes the offset derived from the change in value of the underlying assets and liabilities which could reduce the adverse effect significantly 

interest rate risk of debt instruments   biorad centrally manages the shortterm cash surpluses and shortfalls of its subsidiaries our holdings of variable rate debt instruments at yearend were analyzed to determine their sensitivity to movements in interest rates due to the relatively small amount of shortterm variable rate debt we have outstanding there would not be a material impact to earnings or cash flows if interest rates moved adversely by 10 our longterm debt consists primarily of fixedrate instruments and is thus insulated from interest rate changes as of december 31 2014  the overall interest rate risk associated with our debt was not significant

not applicable 




 i tem 9a controls and procedures 

 

we maintain “disclosure controls and procedures” as such term is defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended “exchange act” that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in securities and exchange commission rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer ceo and chief financial officer cfo as appropriate to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure in designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures management recognized that disclosure controls and procedures no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met additionally in designing disclosure controls and procedures our management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the costbenefit relationship of possible disclosure controls and procedures the design of any disclosure controls and procedures also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions 

  

subject to the limitations noted above our management with the participation of our ceo and cfo has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the year covered by this annual report on form 10k based on that evaluation the ceo and cfo have concluded that as 

of such date our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to meet the objective for which they were designed and operate at the reasonable assurance level 

b management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the company as defined in rule 13a15f or 15d15f of the exchange act internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that i pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets ii provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors and iii provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

our management assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2014 using the criteria established in internal control  integrated framework 1992 issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso based on this assessment and those criteria management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 2014 our internal control over financial reporting has been audited by kpmg llp an independent registered public accounting firm as stated in their report which appears in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

c changes in internal control over financial reporting 

in connection with our preparation of our financial statements for 2013 and our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting we determined that we had a material weakness at december 31 2013 in the design of monitoring controls over operations at certain of our locations both within the united states and overseas as well as a lack of documentation required to operate these controls appropriately at december 31 2014 management believes it has sufficient evidence to conclude that the changes listed below which were initiated throughout the year and which were designed to remediate the material weakness were completely implemented during the threemonth period ended december 31 2014 changes designed to remediate the material weakness that were implemented during 2014 include the following

clinical diagnostics segment 

our clinical diagnostics segment designs manufactures sells and supports test systems informatics systems test kits and specialized quality controls that serve clinical laboratories in the global diagnostics market our products currently address specific niches within the in vitro diagnostics ivd test market and we focus on the higher margin higher growth segments of this market 

we supply more than 3000 different products that cover more than 300 clinical diagnostic tests to the ivd test market based on the most recent studies we estimate that the worldwide sales for products in the markets we serve were approximately 100 billion ivd tests are conducted outside the human body and are used to identify and measure substances in a patient’s tissue blood or urine our products consist of reagents instruments and software typically provided to our customers as an integrated package to allow them to generate reproducible test results revenue in this business is highly recurring as laboratories typically standardize test methodologies which are dependent on a particular supplier’s equipment reagents and consumable products an installed base of diagnostic test systems creates an ongoing source of revenue through the sale of test kits for each sample analyzed on an installed system our principal clinical diagnostic customers include hospital laboratories reference laboratories transfusion laboratories and physician office laboratories 

raw materials and components 

we utilize a wide variety of chemicals biological materials electronic components machined metal parts optical parts minicomputers and peripheral devices most of these materials and components are available from numerous sources and we have not experienced difficulty in securing adequate supplies 

patents and trademarks 

we own numerous us and international patents and patent licenses we believe however that our ability to develop and manufacture our products depends primarily on our knowledge technology and special skills we pay royalties on the sales of certain products under several patent license agreements we view these patents and license agreements as valuable assets 

seasonal operations and backlog 

our business is not inherently seasonal however the european custom of concentrating vacation during the summer months usually tempers third quarter sales volume and operating income 

for the most part we operate in markets characterized by short lead times and the absence of significant backlogs management has concluded that backlog information is not material to our business as a whole 

sales and marketing 

we conduct our worldwide operations through an extensive direct sales force and service network employing approximately 1000 sales and service people around the world our sales force typically consists of experienced industry practitioners with scientific training and we maintain a separate specialist sales force for each of our segments our direct sales approach contrasts with the distributor approach used by some of our competitors allowing us to sell a broader range of our products and have more direct contact with our customers 

our customer base is broad and diversified our worldwide customer base includes 1 prominent university and research institutions providing us access to more than 150000 scientists in the us alone 2 hospital public health and commercial laboratories 3 other leading diagnostic manufacturers and 4 leading companies in the biotechnology pharmaceutical chemical and food industries in 2011  no single customer accounted for more than two  percent of our total net sales our sales are affected by certain external factors for example a number of our customers particularly in the life science segment are substantially dependent on government grants and research contracts for their funding a significant reduction of government funding would have a detrimental effect on the results of this segment 

most of our international sales are generated by our whollyowned subsidiaries and their branch offices certain of these subsidiaries also have manufacturing facilities biorad’s international operations are subject to certain risks common to foreign operations in general such as changes in governmental regulations import restrictions and foreign exchange fluctuations however our international operations are principally in developed nations which we regard as presenting no significantly greater risks to our operations than are present in the united states 

competition 

the markets served by our product groups are highly competitive our competitors range in size from startups to large multinational corporations with significant resources and reach reliable independent information on sales and market share of products produced by our competitors is not generally available we believe however based on our own estimates no one company is so dominant that it prevents other companies including biorad from competing effectively we compete mainly in market segments where our products and technology offer customers specific advantages over the competition 

because of the breadth of its product lines the life science segment does not face the same competitors for all of its products competitors in this market include ge biosciences life technologies merck millipore and thermo fisher scientific we compete primarily based on meeting performance specifications 

major competitors in the clinical diagnostics segment include roche abbott laboratories diagnostic division siemens medical diagnostics solutions danaher thermo fisher becton dickinson biomérieux ortho clinical diagnostics tosoh immucor and diasorin 

research and development 

we conduct extensive research and development activities in all areas of our business employing approximately 850  people worldwide in these activities research and development have played a major role in biorads growth and are expected to continue to do so in the future our research teams are continuously developing new products and new applications for existing products in our development of new products and applications we interact with scientific and medical professionals at universities hospitals and medical schools and within our industry we spent approximately 1864 million  1723 million  and 1636 million  on research and development activities during the years ended december 31 2011  2010  and 2009  respectively 

regulatory matters 

the manufacturing marketing and labeling of certain of our products primarily diagnostic products are subject to regulation in the united states by the center for devices and radiological health of the united states food and drug administration fda and in other jurisdictions by state and foreign government authorities fda regulations require that some new products have premarketing approval by the fda and require certain products to be manufactured in accordance with “good manufacturing practices” to be extensively tested and to be properly labeled to disclose test results and performance claims and limitations 

as a multinational manufacturer and distributor of sophisticated instrumentation we must meet a wide array of electromagnetic compatibility and safety compliance requirements to satisfy regulations in the united states the european community and other jurisdictions 

our operations are subject to federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations that govern such activities as transportation of goods emissions to air and discharges to water as well as handling and disposal practices for solid hazardous and medical wastes in addition to environmental laws that regulate our operations we are also subject to environmental laws and regulations that create liabilities and cleanup responsibility for spills disposals or other releases of hazardous substances into the environment as a result of our operations or otherwise impacting real property that we own or operate the environmental laws and regulations could also subject us to claims by third parties for damages resulting from any spills disposals or releases resulting from our operations or at any of our properties 

these regulatory requirements vary widely among countries 

employees 

at december 31 2011  biorad had approximately 7030  fulltime employees fewer than seven  percent of biorads approximately 2950  us employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement which will expire on november 7 2012 many of biorads nonus fulltime employees especially in france are covered by collective bargaining agreements we consider our employee relations in general to be good

 item 1a risk factors 

the following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating our business and the forwardlooking information contained in this annual report on form 10k we believe that any of the following risks could have a material affect on our business operations industry financial position or our future financial performance while we believe that we have identified and discussed below the key risk factors affecting our business there may be additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known or that are not currently believed to be significant that may adversely affect our business operations industry financial position and financial performance in the future 

the ongoing investigation by our audit committee and by government agencies of possible violations by us of the united states foreign corrupt practices act and similar laws could have a material adverse effect on our business 

based on an internal review we have identified conduct in certain of our overseas operations that may have violated the antibribery provisions of the united states foreign corrupt practices act fcpa and is likely to have violated the fcpa’s books and records and internal controls provisions and our own internal policies in may 2010 we voluntarily disclosed these matters to the us department of justice doj and the securities and exchange commission sec each of which commenced an investigation the audit committee of our board of directors audit committee has assumed direct responsibility for reviewing these matters and has hired experienced independent counsel to conduct an investigation and provide legal advice we have provided and intend to continue to provide additional information to the doj and the sec as the audit committee’s investigation progresses 

the audit committee’s investigation and the doj and sec investigations are continuing and we are presently unable to predict the duration scope or results of the audit committee’s investigation of the investigations by the doj or the sec or whether either agency will commence any legal actions the doj and the sec have a broad range of civil and criminal sanctions under the fcpa and other laws and regulations including but not limited to injunctive relief disgorgement fines penalties modifications to business practices including the termination or modification of existing business relationships the imposition of compliance programs and the retention of a monitor to oversee compliance with the fcpa we are unable to estimate the outcome of this matter however the imposition of any of these sanctions or remedial measures could have a material adverse effect on our business 

including our results of operations cash balance and credit rates we have not to date determined whether any of the activities in question violated the laws of the foreign jurisdictions in which they took place 

we previously identified significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that when considered and taken together had constituted a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting although we have remediated those significant deficiencies to the extent that they no longer when considered and taken together constitute a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting some remain significant deficiencies and we have identified other significant deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting any failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could result in our failure to meet our reporting obligations and cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information which in turn could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline 

in connection with our audit committee’s investigation of our compliance with the fcpa discussed above our management had identified three significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that when considered and taken together had constituted a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2010 and through the first three quarters of 2011 a significant deficiency is defined as a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting that is less severe than a material weakness yet important enough to merit attention by those responsible for oversight of our financial reporting a material weakness is defined as a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis 

the three significant deficiencies that we identified were the result of i a number of entitylevel control deficiencies including our lack of a comprehensive fcpa policy and training program our lack of a formal effective disclosure committee to facilitate our compliance with section 302 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 inadequate policies regarding enterprisewide risk assessment and management related to doing business in highrisk emerging markets our failure to perform background checks on certain parties prior to entering into material contracts with such parties our lack of compliance with our existing code of business ethics and conduct in certain countries and ineffective disclosure of significant exceptions to compliance with company policies through our quarterly management subcertification process ii a number of control deficiencies related to our expenditure processes at certain of our international subsidiaries and iii a number of control deficiencies related to our revenue and accounts receivable process at certain of our international subsidiaries 

in response to and following identification of the material weakness management has enhanced the operation of a number of existing controls related to biorads internal control over financial reporting including our previously existing controls and processes for fcpa compliance and implemented additional controls we have determined that these actions have remediated significant deficiencies that when considered and taken together constituted the material weakness described above to the extent that a material weakness no longer exists however we continue to have a significant deficiency related to our revenue process and we have identified two additional significant deficiencies with respect to i reagent rentals at certain of our international subsidiaries and ii multiple controls for various business processes at a more limited number of minor international subsidiaries 

we cannot assure you that we will be able to remediate these significant deficiencies or that additional significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting will not be identified in the future such significant deficiencies or material weaknesses could result in material misstatements in our financial statements and cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations which in turn could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline any such failure could also adversely affect the results of our periodic management evaluations and annual auditor attestation reports regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting required by section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 

on april 13 2011 a shareholder derivative lawsuit was filed against each of our directors in the superior court for contra costa county california the case which also names the company as a nominal defendant is captioned city of riviera beach general employees’ retirement system v david schwartz et al case no msc1100854 

in the complaint the plaintiff alleges that our directors breached their fiduciary duties by failing to ensure that we had sufficient internal controls and systems for compliance with the fcpa purportedly seeking relief on our behalf the plaintiff seeks an award of unspecified compensatory and punitive damages costs and expenses including attorneys’ fees and a declaration that our directors have breached their fiduciary duties we and the individual defendants filed a demurrer requesting dismissal of the complaint in this case as well as a motion to stay this matter pending resolution of the abovereferenced investigations by the doj and sec following a hearing on september 30 2011 the court sustained our demurrer and dismissed the complaint without prejudice and granted the plaintiff until february 29 2012 to file an amended complaint the parties subsequently agreed to extend that date to march 29 2012 subject to court approval the court denied our motion to stay this matter because it dismissed the complaint 

adverse changes in general domestic and worldwide economic conditions and instability and disruption of credit markets could adversely affect our operating results financial condition or liquidity 

the continuing slow economic growth in developed nations may adversely affect our future results of operations demand for our products and services could change more dramatically than in previous years based on activity funding reimbursement constraints and support levels from government universities hospitals and private industry including diagnostic laboratories the need for certain sovereign nations with large annual deficits to curtail spending could lead to slower growth of or even a decline in our business although signs of limited recovery may exist in some markets there are continued concerns about systemic economic imbalance the availability and cost of credit declining asset values and geopolitical issues that contribute to increased market volatility and uncertain expectations for the global economy these conditions combined with greater volatility in business activity levels and consumer confidence high unemployment and volatile oil prices contributed to unprecedented levels of volatility in the capital markets in recent years continuing or recurring disruptions in the capital and credit markets may adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

as a result of these market conditions the cost and availability of credit has been and may continue to be adversely affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads concern about the stability of the markets generally and the strength of counterparties specifically has led many private sector investors to reduce and in some cases cease to provide credit to governments businesses and consumers these factors have led to depressed spending by some governments businesses and consumers our customers and suppliers may experience cash flow concerns and as a result customers may modify delay or cancel plans to purchase our products and suppliers may increase their prices reduce their output or change terms of sales additionally if customers’ or suppliers’ operating and financial performance deteriorates or if they are unable to make scheduled payments or obtain credit customers may not be able to pay or may delay payment of amounts owed to us sovereign nations either delaying payment for goods and services or renegotiating their debts could impact our liquidity the situation in these sovereign nations is continuously developing and we have no greater knowledge of the situation other than what is being reported in the media as of december 31 2011 we had accounts receivable net of allowance for doubtful accounts in spain italy greece and portugal of 813 million 

suppliers may restrict credit or impose less favorable payment terms any inability of current andor potential customers to pay us for our products or any demands by suppliers for accelerated payment terms may adversely affect our earnings and cash flow additionally strengthening of the us dollar associated with the global financial crisis may adversely affect the results of our international operations when those results are translated into us dollars 

furthermore the disruption in the credit markets could impede our access to capital especially if we are unable to maintain our current credit ratings should we have limited access to additional financing sources when needed we may decide to defer capital expenditures or seek other higher cost sources of liquidity which may or may not be available to us on acceptable terms continued turbulence in the us and international markets and economies and prolonged declines in business and consumer spending may adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition and the liquidity and financial condition of our customers including our ability to refinance maturing liabilities and access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs 

we cannot assure you that we will be able to integrate acquired companies products or technologies into our company successfully or we may not be able to realize the anticipated benefits from the acquisitions 

as part of our overall business strategy we pursue acquisitions of and investments in complementary companies products and technologies in order to be successful in these activities we must among other things 

 

the benefits of any acquisition may prove to be less than anticipated and may not outweigh the costs reported in our financial statements completing any potential future acquisition could cause significant diversion of our management’s time and resources if we acquire new companies products or technologies we may be required to assume contingent liabilities or record impairment charges for goodwill and other intangible assets over time we cannot assure you that we will successfully overcome these risks or any other problems we encounter in connection with any acquisitions and any such acquisitions could adversely affect our business financial position or operating results 

the industries and market segments in which we operate are highly competitive and we may not be able to compete effectively with larger companies with greater financial resources than we have 

the life science and clinical diagnostics markets are each highly competitive some of our competitors have greater financial resources than we do and are less leveraged than we are making them better equipped to license technologies and intellectual property from third parties or to fund research and development manufacturing and marketing efforts moreover competitive and regulatory conditions in many markets in which we operate restrict our ability to fully recover through price increases higher costs of acquired goods and services resulting from inflation and other drivers of cost increases our competitors can be expected to continue to improve the design and performance of their products and to introduce new products with competitive price and performance characteristics maintaining these advantages will require us to continue to invest in research and development sales and marketing and customer service and support we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient resources to continue to make such investments or that we will be successful in maintaining such advantages 

we have significant international operations which subject us to various risks such as general economic and market conditions in the countries in which we operate 

a significant portion of our sales are made outside of the united states our foreign subsidiaries generated 70  of our net sales for the year ended december 31 2011  our international operations are subject to risks common to foreign operations such as general economic and market conditions in the countries in which we operate changes in governmental regulations political instability import restrictions additional scrutiny over certain financial instruments and currency exchange rate risks we cannot assure you that shifts in currency exchange rates especially significant strengthening of the us dollar compared to the euro will not have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

we are dependent on government funding and the capital spending programs of our customers and the effect of healthcare reform on government funding and our customers’ ability to purchase our products is uncertain 

our customers include universities clinical diagnostics laboratories government agencies hospitals and pharmaceutical biotechnology and chemical companies the capital spending programs of these institutions and companies have a significant effect on the demand for our products such programs are based on a wide variety of factors including the resources available to make such purchases the availability of funding from grants by governments or government agencies the spending priorities among various types of equipment and the policies regarding capital expenditures during industry downturns or recessionary periods if government funding to our customers were to decrease or if our customers were to decrease or reallocate their budgets in a manner adverse to us our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

healthcare reform and the growth of managed care organizations have been and continue to be significant factors in the clinical diagnostics market the trend towards managed care together with healthcare reform of the delivery system in the united states and efforts to reform in europe has resulted in increased pressure on healthcare providers and other participants in the healthcare industry to reduce costs consolidation among healthcare providers has resulted in fewer more powerful groups whose purchasing power gives them cost containment leverage these competitive forces place constraints on the levels of overall pricing and thus could have a material adverse effect on our profit margins for products we sell in clinical diagnostics markets to the extent that the healthcare industry seeks to address the need to contain costs by limiting the number of clinical tests being performed our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected if these changes in the healthcare markets in the united states and europe continue we could be forced to alter our approach in selling marketing distributing and servicing our products 

our failure to improve our product offerings and develop and introduce new products may negatively impact our business 

our future success depends on our ability to continue to improve our product offerings and develop and introduce new product lines and extensions that integrate new technological advances if we are unable to integrate technological advances into our product offerings or to design develop manufacture and market new product lines and extensions successfully and in a timely manner our operating results will be adversely affected we cannot assure you that our product and process development efforts will be successful or that new products we introduce will achieve market acceptance 

if we experience a disruption of our information technology systems or if we fail to successfully implement manage and integrate our information technology and reporting systems it could harm our business 

our information technology it systems are an integral part of our business and a serious disruption of our it systems could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations we depend on our it systems to process orders manage inventory and collect accounts receivable our it systems also allow us to efficiently purchase products from our suppliers and ship products to our customers on a timely basis maintain costeffective operations and provide customer service we cannot assure you that our contingency plans will allow us to operate at our current level of efficiency 

our ability to implement our business plan in a rapidly evolving market requires effective planning reporting and analytical processes we expect that we will need to continue to improve and further integrate our it systems reporting systems and operating procedures by training and educating our employees with respect to these improvements and integrations on an ongoing basis in order to effectively run our business if we fail to successfully manage and integrate our it systems reporting systems and operating procedures it could adversely affect our business or operating results 

risks relating to intellectual property rights may negatively impact our business 

we rely on a combination of copyright trade secret patent and trademark laws and thirdparty nondisclosure agreements to protect our intellectual property rights and products however we cannot assure you that our intellectual property rights will not be challenged invalidated circumvented or rendered unenforceable or that meaningful protection or adequate remedies will be available to us for instance it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy our intellectual property to reverse engineer or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary or to develop equivalent technologies independently additionally third parties may assert patent copyright and other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to us if we are unable to license or otherwise access protected technology used in our products or if we lose our rights under any existing licenses we could be prohibited from manufacturing and marketing such products we may find it necessary to enforce our patents or other intellectual property rights or to defend ourselves against claimed infringement of the rights of others through litigation which could result in substantial costs to us and divert our resources we also could incur substantial costs to redesign our products to defend any legal action taken against us or to pay damages to an infringed party the foregoing matters could adversely impact our business 

we are subject to substantial government regulation 

some of our products primarily diagnostic products production processes and marketing are subject to federal state local and foreign regulation including the fda and its foreign counterparts we are also subject to government regulation of the use and handling of a number of materials and controlled substances failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in substantial liability to us suspension or cessation of our operations restrictions on our ability to expand at our present locations or require us to make significant capital expenditures or incur other significant expenses 

we are currently subject to environmental regulations and enforcement proceedings 

our operations are subject to federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations that govern such activities as transportation of goods emissions to air and discharges to water as well as handling and disposal practices for solid hazardous and medical wastes in addition to environmental laws that regulate our operations we are also subject to environmental laws and regulations that create liability and cleanup responsibility for spills disposals or other releases of hazardous substances into the environment as a result of our operations or otherwise impacting real property that we own or operate the environmental laws and regulations also subject us to claims by third parties for damages resulting from any spills disposals or releases resulting from our operations or at any of our properties 

we may in the future incur capital and operating costs to comply with currently existing laws and regulations and possible new statutory enactments and these expenditures may be significant we have incurred and may in the future incur fines related to environmental matters and liability for costs or damages related to spills or other releases of hazardous substances into the environment at sites where we have operated or at offsite locations where we have sent hazardous substances for disposal we can provide no assurance however that such matters or any future obligations to comply with environmental laws and regulations will not have a material impact on our operations or financial condition 

loss of key personnel could hurt our business 

our products and services are highly technical in nature in general only highly qualified and trained scientists have the necessary skills to develop and market our products and provide our services in addition some of our manufacturing positions are highly technical we face intense competition for these professionals from our competitors customers marketing partners and other companies throughout our industry we generally do not enter into employment agreements requiring these employees to continue in our employment for any period of time any failure on our part to hire train and retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel could substantially damage our business additionally if we were to lose a sufficient number of our research and development 

scientists and were unable to replace them or satisfy our needs for research and development through outsourcing it could adversely affect our business 

a significant majority of our voting stock is held by the schwartz family which could lead to conflicts of interest 

we have two classes of voting stock class a common stock and class b common stock with a few exceptions holders of class a and class b common stock vote as a single class when voting as a single class each share of class a common stock is entitled to onetenth of a vote while each share of class b common stock has one vote in the election or removal of directors the classes vote separately and the holders of class a common stock are entitled to elect 25 of the board of directors with holders of class b common stock electing the remaining directors 

as of february 14 2012 the schwartz family collectively held approximately 16  of our class a common stock and 91  of our class b common stock as a result the schwartz family is able to elect a majority of the directors effect fundamental changes in our direction and control matters affecting us including the allocation of business 

opportunities that may be suitable for our company in addition this concentration of ownership and voting power may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company 

the schwartz family may exercise its control over us according to interests that are different from other investors’ or debtors’ interests 

natural disasters terrorist attacks or acts of war may cause damage or disruption to us and our employees facilities information systems security systems vendors and customers which could significantly impact our net sales costs and expenses and financial condition 

we have significant manufacturing and distribution facilities particularly in the western united states france and switzerland in particular the western united states has experienced a number of earthquakes wildfires floods landslides and other natural disasters in recent years the occurrences could damage or destroy our facilities which may result in interruptions to our business and losses that exceed our insurance coverage terrorist attacks such as those that occurred on september 11 2001 have contributed to economic instability in the united states and further acts of terrorism bioterrorism violence or war could affect the markets in which we operate our business operations our expectations and other forwardlooking statements contained or incorporated in this document any of these events could cause a decrease in our revenue earnings and cash flows 

we may incur losses in future periods due to writedowns in the value of financial instruments 

we have positions in a variety of financial instruments including asset backed securities and other similar instruments financial markets are quite volatile and the markets for these securities can be illiquid the value of these securities will continue to be impacted by external market factors including default rates changes in the value of the underlying property such as residential or commercial real estate rating agency actions the prices at which observable market transactions occur and the financial strength of various entities such as financial guarantors who provide insurance for the securities should we need to convert these positions to cash we may not be able to sell these instruments without significant losses due to current debtor financial conditions or other market considerations 

we have substantial debt and have the ability to incur additional debt the principal and interest payment obligations of such debt may restrict our future operations and impair our ability to meet our obligations under our notes 

as of december 31 2011  we and our subsidiaries had approximately 7325 million  of outstanding indebtedness in addition we are permitted to incur additional debt provided we comply with the limitation on the incurrence of additional indebtedness and disqualified capital stock covenants contained in the indenture governing our 80 senior subordinated notes due 2016 80 notes 

the following chart shows certain important credit statistics 



our incurrence of substantial amounts of debt may have important consequences for instance it could 

 

our ability to satisfy our obligations and to reduce our total debt depends on our future operating performance and on economic financial competitive and other factors many of which are beyond our control our business may not generate sufficient cash flow and future financings may not be available to provide sufficient net proceeds to meet these obligations or to successfully execute our business strategy 

our existing credit facility the indenture governing our 80 notes and the terms of our other debt instruments including agreements we may enter in the future contain or will contain covenants imposing significant restrictions on our business these restrictions may affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise these covenants place restrictions on our ability to among other things 

 

our existing credit facility also requires that we meet certain financial tests and maintain certain financial ratios including a maximum consolidated leverage ratio test minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio test and a minimum net worth test 

our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control including prevailing economic financial and industry conditions the breach of any of these restrictions could result in a default an event of default under our debt agreements would permit some of our lenders to declare all amounts borrowed from 

them to be due and payable together with accrued and unpaid interest if we were unable to repay debt to our senior secured lenders these lenders could proceed against the collateral securing that debt the collateral is substantially all of our personal property assets the assets of our domestic subsidiaries and 65 of the capital stock of certain of our foreign subsidiaries in addition acceleration of our other indebtedness may cause us to be unable to make interest payments on our outstanding notes and repay the principal amount of our outstanding notes or may cause the future subsidiary guarantors if any to be unable to make payments under the guarantees

 item 3 legal proceedings 

tableend

based on an internal review we have identified conduct in certain of our overseas operations that may have violated the antibribery provisions of the united states foreign corrupt practices act fcpa and is likely to have violated the fcpa’s books and records and internal controls provisions and our own internal policies in may 2010 we voluntarily disclosed these matters to the us department of justice doj and the securities and exchange 

commission sec each of which commenced an investigation the audit committee of our board of directors audit committee has assumed direct responsibility for reviewing these matters and has hired experienced independent counsel to conduct an investigation and provide legal advice we have provided and intend to continue to provide additional information to the doj and the sec as the audit committee’s investigation progresses 

the audit committee’s investigation and the doj and sec investigations are continuing and we are presently unable to predict the duration scope or results of the audit committee’s investigation of the investigations by the doj or the sec or whether either agency will commence any legal actions the doj and the sec have a broad range of civil and criminal sanctions under the fcpa and other laws and regulations including but not limited to injunctive relief disgorgement fines penalties modifications to business practices including the termination or modification of existing business relationships the imposition of compliance programs and the retention of a monitor to oversee compliance with the fcpa we are unable to estimate the outcome of this matter however the imposition of any of these sanctions or remedial measures could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition we have not to date determined whether any of the activities in question violated the laws of the foreign jurisdictions in which they took place 

on april 13 2011 a shareholder derivative lawsuit was filed against each of our directors in the superior court for contra costa county california the case which also names the company as a nominal defendant is captioned city of riviera beach general employees’ retirement system v david schwartz et al case no msc1100854 in the complaint the plaintiff alleges that our directors breached their fiduciary duties by failing to ensure that we had sufficient internal controls and systems for compliance with the fcpa purportedly seeking relief on our behalf the plaintiff seeks an award of unspecified compensatory and punitive damages costs and expenses including attorneys’ fees and a declaration that our directors have breached their fiduciary duties we and the individual defendants filed a demurrer requesting dismissal of the complaint in this case as well as a motion to stay this matter pending resolution of the abovereferenced investigations by the doj and sec following a hearing on september 30 2011 the court sustained our demurrer and dismissed the complaint without prejudice and granted the plaintiff until february 29 2012 to file an amended complaint the parties subsequently agreed to extend that date to march 29 2012 subject to court approval the court denied our motion to stay this matter because it dismissed the complaint 

in addition we are party to various other claims legal actions and complaints arising in the ordinary course of business we do not believe at this time that any ultimate liability resulting from any of these other matters will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or liquidity however we cannot give any assurance regarding the ultimate outcome of these other matters and their resolution could be material to our operating results for any particular period depending on the level of income for the period

this discussion should be read in conjunction with the information contained in our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes which are an integral part of the statements 

other than statements of historical fact statements made in this annual report include forward looking statements such as statements with respect to our future financial performance operating results plans and objectives that involve risk and uncertainties forwardlooking statements generally can be identified by the use of forwardlooking terminology such as “believe” “expect” “may” “will” “intend” “estimate” “continue” or similar expressions or the negative of those terms or expressions such statements involve risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to vary materially from those expressed in or indicated by the forwardlooking statements we have based these forward looking statements on our current expectations and projections about future events however actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated depending on a variety of risk factors including among other things changes in general domestic and worldwide economic conditions our 

ability to successfully develop and market new products our reliance on and access to necessary intellectual property our ability to successfully integrate any acquired business our substantial leverage and ability to service our debt competition in and government regulation of the industries in which we operate and the monetary policies of various countries we caution you not to place undue reliance on forwardlooking statements which reflect an analysis only and speak only as of the date hereof we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise except as required by federal securities law 

overview  we are a multinational manufacturer and worldwide distributor of our own life science research and clinical diagnostics products our business is organized into two primary segments life science and clinical diagnostics with the mission to provide scientists with specialized tools needed for biological research and clinical diagnostics 

we sell more than 8000 products and services to a diverse client base comprised of scientific research healthcare education and government customers worldwide we manufacture and supply our customers with a range of reagents apparatus and equipment to separate complex chemical and biological materials and to identify analyze and purify components because our customers require standardization for their experiments and test results much of our revenues are recurring 

we are impacted by the support of many governments for both research and healthcare the current global economic outlook is becoming increasingly uncertain as the need to control government social spending by many governments limits opportunities for growth approximately 30  of our 2011 consolidated net sales are derived from the united states and approximately 70  are derived from international locations the international sales are largely denominated in local currencies such as euros swiss franc japanese yen singapore dollar and british sterling as a result our consolidated net sales expressed in dollars benefit when the us dollar weakens and suffer when the dollar strengthens when the us dollar strengthens we benefit from lower cost of sales from our own international manufacturing sites as well as nonus suppliers and from lower international operating expenses 

in october 2011 we acquired all the issued and outstanding stock of quantalife inc quantalife the fair value of the consideration as of the acquisition date was 1794 million  which comprised of 1503 million  paid in cash at the closing date a 50 million  holdback of cash until the completion of certain postclosing matters and 241 million  in contingent consideration potentially payable to quantalife shareholders the contingent consideration could reach 48 million  upon the achievement of certain sales and development milestones the pretax loss from operations of quantalife was 70 million for the period from acquisition october 4 2011 through december 31 2011 these results of operations of quantalife are included in the results of operations of our life science segment this transaction was accounted for as the acquisition of a business integrating the acquired quantalife business into biorad is expected to expand our current stateoftheart methods of quantitative polymerase chain reaction pcr and we believe it will complement biorads existing amplification business 

the determination of the fair value of net assets acquired of quantalife was based upon valuation information estimates and assumptions available at october 4 2011 we are still finalizing our analysis of a limited number of acquired tax attributes which could affect the fair values of certain deferred tax assets and goodwill as a result as of december 31 2011 our accounting for the acquisition was preliminary 

in january 2012 we purchased certain assets from a current raw materials supplier for approximately 155 million the asset acquisition will be included in the clinical diagnostics segments results of operations from the acquisition date and will be accounted for as a business combination we believe this acquisition will allow us to secure the supply of critical raw materials and lower our overall costs in the clinical diagnostics segment 

the following shows cost of goods sold gross profit expense items and net income as a percentage of net sales 



we intend that the discussions of critical accounting policies and estimates and recent accounting pronouncements that follow will assist you in understanding how such principles estimates and accounting pronouncements affect our financial condition and results of operations as well as significant factors that caused changes in our financial condition and results of operations for the years ended december 31 2011  and 2010  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the accompanying discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities and contingencies as of the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis we base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources however future events may cause us to change our assumptions and estimates which may require adjustment actual results could differ from these estimates we have determined that for the periods reported in this annual report on form 10k the following accounting policies and estimates are critical in understanding our financial condition and results of operations 

accounting for income taxes   management is required to make estimates related to our income tax provision in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate this process involves estimating our current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within our consolidated balance sheets management then assesses the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent management believes that recovery is not likely a valuation allowance must be established to the extent management establishes a valuation allowance or increases this allowance in a period an increase to expense within the provision for income taxes in the consolidated statements of income may result 

we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements on a particular tax position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon settlement the amount of unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted as appropriate for changes in facts and circumstances such as significant amendments to existing tax law new regulations or interpretations by the taxing authorities new information obtained during a tax examination or resolution of an examination we recognize both accrued interest and penalties where appropriate related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 

significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded in connection with the deferred tax assets we have recorded a valuation allowance of 489 million  and 370 million  as of december 31 2011  and 2010  respectively due to 

uncertainties related to our ability to utilize some of the deferred tax assets primarily consisting of certain foreign net operating losses carried forward the valuation allowance is based on management’s current estimates of taxable income for the jurisdictions in which we operate and the period over which the deferred tax assets will be recoverable in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or these estimates are adjusted in future periods an additional valuation allowance may need to be established which would increase the tax provision lowering income and impacting our financial position should realization of these deferred tax assets for which a valuation allowance has been provided occur the provision for income taxes may decrease raising income and positively impacting biorad’s financial position 

valuation of goodwill and longlived assets   goodwill represents the excess of the cost over the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses goodwill amounts are assigned to reporting units at the time of acquisition and are adjusted for any subsequent significant transfers of business between reporting units we assess the impairment of goodwill annually in the fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable we perform the impairment tests of goodwill at our reporting unit level which is one level below our reporting segments the goodwill impairment test consists of a twostep process the first step of the goodwill impairment test used to identify potential impairment compares the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is not required the second step if required compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill the fair value of a reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the price paid to acquire the reporting unit if the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill exceeds its implied fair value an impairment charge is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 

we use a projected discounted cash flow model to determine the fair value of a reporting unit this discounted cash value method for determining goodwill may be different from the fair value that would result from an actual transaction between a willing buyer and a willing seller projections such as discounted cash flow models are inherently uncertain and accordingly actual future cash flows may differ materially from projected cash flows management judgment is required in developing the assumptions for the discounted cash flow model these assumptions include revenue growth rates profit margins future capital expenditures working capital needs expected foreign currency rates discount rates and terminal values we estimate future cash flows using current and longerterm high level financial forecasts these forecasts take into account the current economic environment the discount rates used are compiled using independent sources current trends in similar businesses and other observable market data changes to these rates might result in material changes in the valuation and determination of the recoverability of goodwill for example an increase in the discount rate used to discount cash flows will decrease the computed fair value in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test we apply a 10 decrease to the fair value of each reporting unit 

to validate the reasonableness of the reporting unit fair values we reconcile the aggregate fair values of the reporting units to the enterprise market capitalization including an implied control premium in performing the reconciliation we may depending on the volatility of the market value of our stock price use either the stock price on the valuation date or the average stock price over a range of dates around the valuation date we compare the implied control premium to premiums paid in observable recent transactions of comparable companies to determine if the accumulated fair values of all the reporting units are reasonable 

for purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment loss a longlived asset or assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities we assess the impairment of longlived assets including identifiable intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable factors that we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include 

 20 

overall business 

 

when management determines that the carrying value of longlived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment we test for any impairment based on a projected undiscounted cash flow method projected future operating results and cash flows of the asset or asset group are used to establish the fair value used in evaluating the carrying value of longlived and intangible assets we estimate the future cash flows of the longlived assets using current and longterm financial forecasts the carrying amount of a longlived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset if this is the case an impairment loss would be recognized the impairment loss recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value 

in 2009  our reviews indicated an impairment charge of 38 million  related to the developed technology intangible assets of certain product lines that were acquired in 2006 there were no impairment losses recorded in 2011  and 2010  

valuation of inventories   we value inventory at the lower of the actual cost to purchase andor manufacture the inventory or the current estimated net realizable value of the inventory we review inventory quantities on hand and reduce the cost basis of excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on an estimated forecast of product demand production requirements and the quality efficacy and potency of raw materials this review is done on a quarterly basis or if warranted by the circumstances more frequently in addition our industry is characterized by technological change frequent new product development and product obsolescence that could result in an increase in the amount of obsolete inventory quantities on hand our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate and if too high we may have overstated the carrying value of our inventory in the future if inventory is determined to be overvalued we would be required to write down the value of inventory to market and recognize such costs in our cost of goods sold at the time of such determination therefore although we make efforts to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand and perform procedures to safeguard overall inventory quality any significant unanticipated changes in demand technological developments regulations storage conditions or other economic or environmental factors affecting biological materials could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and reported results of operations 

valuation of investments   we regularly review our investments for factors that may indicate that a decline in the fair value of an investment below its carrying value is otherthantemporary some factors considered in evaluating whether or not a decline in fair value is otherthantemporary include our ability and intent to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for a recovery in value the duration and extent to which the fair value has been less than cost and the financial condition and prospects of the issuer such reviews are inherently uncertain in that the value of the investment may not fully recover or may decline further in future periods resulting in realized losses 

warranty reserves   we warrant certain equipment against defects in design materials and workmanship generally for a period of one year upon delivery and on acceptance of that equipment we establish as part of cost of goods sold a provision for the expected costs of such warranty repairs based on historical experience specific warranty terms and customer feedback a review is performed on a quarterly basis to assess the adequacy of our warranty reserve and it is adjusted if necessary the warranty reserve is based on actual experience and expected future costs to be incurred should realized costs be higher than expected costs cost of goods sold would be lower in the period of estimation and higher when realized 

allowance for doubtful accounts   we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the collectability of our customer accounts the amount of the allowance is determined by analyzing known uncollectible accounts the age of our receivables economic conditions in the customers’ country or industry historical losses and our customers’ general creditworthiness amounts later determined and specifically identified to be uncollectible are charged or written off against this allowance uncertainty in the current economic 

environment if prolonged could result in greater amounts becoming uncollectible in the future should the estimates of losses be higher than the actual uncollectible accounts we would report lower profitability when the estimates are made and higher profitability when the receivable is collected 

litigation accruals   we record as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets estimated amounts for claims that are probable and can be reasonably estimated the likelihood of a material change in these estimated reserves is dependent on the possible outcome of settlement negotiations regulatory or judicial review and the development of facts and circumstances in extended litigation which could change claims or assessments when both the amount and range of loss on some outstanding litigation is uncertain we disclose in the footnotes of the financial statements when we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of a material liability that could result from unfavorable outcomes in litigation as events occur we will assess the potential liability related to our pending litigation and revise our estimates such revisions could materially impact our results of operations 

results of operations  sales gross margins and expenses 

net sales 

n et sales sales in 2011 increased to 207 billion  from 193 billion  in 2010 a sales increase of 76  excluding the impact of foreign currency 2011 sales increased by approximately 31  compared to 2010 currency neutral sales growth was achieved in many regions except for europe 

the life science segment sales in 2011 were 6947 million  an increase of 72  compared to 2010 on a currency neutral basis sales increased 34  compared to 2010 product groups showing growth included process chromatography media imaging systems amplification and electrophoresis currency neutral sales growth in the life science segment was primarily in the us latin america and the pacific rim in many developed countries constraints in government budgets have limited sales growth opportunities 

the clinical diagnostics segment sales in 2011 were 136 billion  an increase of 78  compared to 2010 on a currency neutral basis sales increased 29  compared to 2010 clinical diagnostics product lines generating growth were immunohematology quality controls bioplex 2200 diabetes monitoring and clinical microbiology currency neutral sales growth was primarily in the pacific rim partially offset by weaker sales in europe due to spending constraints in several countries national healthcare systems 

sales in 2010 increased 80 to 193 billion from 178 billion in 2009 with biotest contributing approximately 561 million to the growth in sales foreign currency had minimal impact on total sales growth excluding the additional sales from the biotest acquisition 2010 sales grew by 48 on a currency neutral basis currency neutral sales growth excluding biotest was achieved in all regions but was primarily driven by growth in the pacific rim eastern europe and latin america 

the life science segment sales in 2010 were 6481 million an increase of 26 or 22 on a currency neutral basis compared to 2009 sales growth was primarily attributed to realtime pcr products and a new product line tc 10 ™     automated cell counter partially offset by general market weakness especially in europe currency neutral sales growth in the life science segment was primarily in the pacific rim eastern europe latin america and north america while european sales declined 

the clinical diagnostics segment reported sales in 2010 of 127 billion an increase of 110 compared to 2009 with biotest contributing approximately 49 to the sales growth on a currency neutral basis sales in 2010 increased 113 including biotest compared to 2009 clinical diagnostics realized growth in its quality controls product line and in immunohematology before the inclusion of biotest diabetes and bioplex ®  2200 instruments and reagents sales growth was primarily in the pacific rim eastern europe and latin america and to a lesser extent north america 

gross margin 

consolidated gross margins were 568  in 2011 compared to 566  in 2010 and were relatively unchanged for both the life science segment and the clinical diagnostics segment 

consolidated gross margins were 566 in 2010 compared to 560 in 2009 life science segment gross margins in 2010 improved from 2009 by approximately 24 the increase was primarily due to improved manufacturing overhead absorption reduction in costs and a favorable product mix toward higher margin products clinical diagnostics segment gross margins in 2010 decreased by approximately 04 from 2009 the biotest acquisition had a negative impact on clinical diagnostics segment gross margins due to higher inventory values resulting from purchase accounting and overall lower margins than historically achieved by the segment partially offsetting this decrease in gross margins was a favorable settlement of intellectual property disputes and lower royalty expenses 

selling general and administrative expense 

consolidated selling general and administrative expenses sga represented 336  of sales in 2011 compared to 330  of sales in 2010 growth in sga was greater than the rate of sales growth increases were primarily driven by employeerelated costs our largest cost professional services bad debt provisions primarily associated with public agencies in southern europe facilities travel information technology and marketing 

consolidated sga represented 330 of sales in 2010 compared to 337 of sales in 2009 the growth rate in absolute sga spending was less than the rate of sales growth moderation in spending for employee related costs and third party commissions lowered the rate of sga spending to sales absolute dollar increases in sga were primarily in employeerelated costs travel and related costs and professional services 

research and development expense 

research and development expense increased to 1864 million  or 90  of sales in 2011 compared to 1723 million  or 89  of sales in 2010 life science segment research and development expense increased in 2011 from 2010 in part due to the acquisition of quantalife in october 2011 life science segment efforts were concentrated on genomics proteomics and process chromatography applications clinical diagnostics segment research and development expense increased in 2011 from 2010 with efforts concentrated on diabetes and immunohematology and is focused mainly on the development and cost reduction of instruments 

research and development expense was 1723 million in 2010 or 89 of sales compared to 1636 million or 92 of sales in 2009 both the life science and clinical diagnostics segments research and development expense increased in absolute dollars however as a percent of sales clinical diagnostics segment expense decreased from 2009 life science segment efforts concentrated on genomics proteomics process chromatography and food diagnostics applications the majority of the clinical diagnostics segment increase was related to an additional emphasis in diabetes monitoring clinical microbiology expanded blood virus diagnostic tests and improved automation

interest expense 

interest expense in 2011 decreased 166 to 531 million  compared to 2010 primarily due to the refinancing of a portion of our debt in december 2010 through january 2011 lowering our overall borrowing rate the interest rates on our current borrowings for our 3000 million of 80 senior subordinated notes are fixed through 2016 at 80 and for our 4250 million of 4875 senior notes are fixed through 2020 at 4875 

interest expense in 2010 increased 355 to 637 million compared to 2009 the increase in interest expense in 2010 from 2009 was primarily due to the payment of a call premium and the expensing of unamortized debt issuance costs for the redemption of the 2000 million of 6125 senior subordinated notes in december 2010 

and the interest associated with the 3000 million of 80 senior subordinated notes that were issued in may 2009 our other principal debt obligation was the 2250 million 75 senior subordinated notes which were redeemed in january 2011 

foreign currency exchange gains and losses 

foreign currency exchange gains and losses consist of foreign currency transaction gains and losses on intercompany net receivables and payables and the change in fair value of our forward foreign exchange contracts used to manage our foreign currency exchange risk net foreign currency exchange losses for 2011  2010  and 2009  were 138 million  39 million  and 50 million  respectively the 2011  2010  and 2009  net foreign currency exchange losses were attributable to market volatility increasing costs to hedge and the result of the estimating process inherent in the timing of shipments and payments of intercompany debt in addition approximately 46 million of the 2011 loss was attributable to entering into larger forward foreign exchange contracts than required all years are affected by the economic hedging program we employ to hedge our intercompany receivables and payables 

other income and expense net 

other income and expense net includes investment and dividend income generally interest income on our cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and long term marketable securities other income expense net for in 2011 increased to 76 million  income compared to 39 million  income in 2010 the increase was primarily due to higher investment income which included dividend income from holdings in sartorius ag whose dividends almost doubled from 2010 and a settlement of a legal dispute in the third quarter of 2010 partially offset by higher otherthantemporary impairment losses on certain investments during 2011 than in 2010 

other income net in 2010 was 39 million compared to 69 million in 2009 the decrease primarily resulted from nonrecurring income of 46 million in 2009 related to the relief of a foreign nonincome based tax obligation partially offset by higher otherthantemporary impairment of investments in 2009 than in 2010 

effective tax rate 

our effective tax rate was 24  and 15  in 2011 and 2010 respectively the effective tax rates for both periods were lower than the us statutory rate due to tax benefits for nontaxable dividend income research and development tax credits differences between us and foreign statutory tax rates and discrete events recorded in the period the lower effective tax rate in 2010 was primarily due to a benefit of approximately 224 million that related to us foreign tax credits associated with a 1639 million distribution of earnings from our foreign affiliates to the us 

our effective tax rate was 15 and 20 in 2010 and 2009 respectively the effective tax rates in 2010 and 2009 both reflected tax benefits for nontaxable dividend income research and development tax credits and differences between us and foreign rates the lower effective tax rate in 2010 was primarily due to a benefit of approximately 224 million that related to us foreign tax credits associated with a 1639 million distribution of earnings from our foreign affiliates to the us 

our effective tax rate may be impacted in the future either favorably or unfavorably by many factors including but not limited to changes to statutory tax rates changes in tax laws or regulations tax audits and settlements and generation of tax credits 

liquidity and capital resources 

biorad operates and conducts business globally primarily through subsidiary companies established in the markets in which we trade goods are manufactured in a small number of locations and are then shipped to local distribution facilities around the world our product mix is diversified and certain products compete largely on product efficacy while others compete on price gross margins are generally sufficient to exceed normal operating 

costs and funding for research and development of new products as well as routine outflows of capital expenditure interest and taxes in addition to the annual positive cash flow from operating activities additional liquidity is readily available via the sale of shortterm investments and access to our 2000 million amended and restated credit agreement credit agreement that we entered into in june 2010 borrowings under the credit agreement are on a revolving basis and can be used to make acquisitions for working capital and for other general corporate purposes we had no outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement as of december 31 2011  the credit agreement expires on june 21 2014 

the continuing slow economic growth in developed nations may adversely affect our future results of operations demand for our products and services could change more dramatically than in previous years based on activity funding reimbursement constraints and support levels from government universities hospitals and private industry including diagnostic laboratories the need for certain sovereign nations with large annual deficits to curtail spending could lead to slower growth of or even a decline in our business sovereign nations either delaying payment for goods and services or renegotiating their debts could impact our liquidity the situation in these sovereign nations is continuously developing and we have no greater knowledge of the situation other than what is being reported in the media as of december 31 2011 we had accounts receivable net of allowance for doubtful accounts in spain italy greece and portugal of 813 million 

at december 31 2011  we had available 8131 million  in cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments under domestic and international lines of credit we had 2205 million  available for borrowing as of december 31 2011  of which 126 million  is reserved for standby letters of credit issued by our banks to guarantee our obligations mostly to meet the deductible amount under insurance policies for our benefit management believes that this availability together with cash flow from operations will be adequate to meet our current objectives for operations research and development capital additions for manufacturing and distribution plant and equipment information technology systems and an acquisition of reasonable proportion to our existing total available capital 

the instability in credit markets along with inadequate capitalization in some parts of the financial services industry could impact both our ability and our customer’s ability to access the necessary capital for acquisition equipment and technology modernization and the financing of inventory and receivables without this crucial intermediary function manufacturers and end users may have to renegotiate existing arrangements reduce activity levels or seek other business partners 

cash flows from operations 

net cash provided by operations was 2598 million  2259 million  and 3251 million  in 2011  2010  and 2009  respectively the net increase between 2011 and 2010 of 339 million  primarily represented higher cash received from customers due to higher sales a decline in interest expense due to the refinancing of a portion of our debt in december 2010 and january 2011 and a decline in income taxes paid that was caused by timing differences partially offset by an increase in the amount paid to suppliers and employees during the second quarter of 2010 biorad made a large payment of 226 million euros to a certain licensor covering royalties for multiple years we continue to focus on cash flow improvements as a global companywide goal 

the net decrease between 2010 and 2009 of 992 million primarily represented an increase in cash paid to suppliers including royalty payments covering multiple years and payments to settle intellectual property disputes higher payments on income taxes and higher interest payments primarily from the call premium and the redemption of the 2000 million of 6125 senior subordinated notes in december 2010 and the interest associated with the 3000 million of 80 senior subordinated notes that were issued in may 2009 partially offsetting this decrease was an increase in cash received from customers compared to 2009 however cash received from customers was at a slower rate than expected in 2010 due to a slowdown in cash collections as many governments especially in europe addressed the need for deficit reductions and sovereign borrowings 

we regularly review the allowance for uncollectible receivables and believe net accounts receivable are fully realizable we also routinely review inventory for the impact of obsolescence and changes in market prices caused by the introduction of new products technologies and in government reimbursement policies we expect the first quarter of 2012 cash flows from operations to be lower than the fourth quarter of 2011 as biorad historically makes larger payments for royalties fourth quarter sales commissions to third parties and annual employee bonuses during this period 

cash flows from investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities including capital expenditures was 3834 million  2165 million  and 1760 million  for 2011  2010  and 2009  respectively capital expenditures in 2011  totaled 1029 million  compared to 885 million  and 680 million  in 2010  and 2009  respectively capital expenditures represent the addition and replacement of production machinery and research equipment ongoing manufacturing and facility additions for expansion regulatory and environmental and compliance also included in capital expenditures are investments in business systems and data communication upgrades and enhancements all periods include equipment placed with clinical diagnostics segment customers who then contract to purchase our reagents for use capital expenditures have increased and we anticipate them to continue to increase in future periods due to the implementation of a global single instance enterprise resource planning erp platform and to expand our ecommerce platform internationally the erp software was purchased in december 2010 the estimated global implementation cost for the single instance erp platform could reach approximately 150 million and is estimated to take approximately four more years to implement 

in october 2011 we acquired all the issued and outstanding stock of quantalife for a total consideration of 1794 million  that was comprised of 1503 million  in cash a 50 million  holdback of cash until the completion of certain postclosing matters and contingent consideration potentially payable to quantalife shareholders the contingent consideration was recognized at its estimated fair value of 241 million  and could reach 48 million  upon the achievement of certain sales and development milestones this transaction was accounted for as the acquisition of a business and the operating results of quantalife are included in our life science segment from the acquisition date integrating the acquired quantalife business into biorad is expected to expand our current stateoftheart methods of quantitative pcr and we believe it will complement biorads existing amplification business 

  

in january 2012 we purchased certain assets from a current raw materials supplier for approximately 155 million the asset acquisition will be included in the clinical diagnostics segments results of operations from the acquisition date and will be accounted for as a business combination we believe this acquisition will allow us to secure the supply of critical raw materials and lower our overall costs in the clinical diagnostics segment 

in june 2011 we acquired the remaining outstanding shares of diamed sea limited diamed thailand from multiple noncontrolling shareholders for approximately 02 million in cash in february 2011 we acquired an additional 39 of distribuidora de analitica para medicina ibérica sa diamed spain from multiple noncontrolling shareholders increasing our ownership in diamed spain to 90 for approximately 25 million euros or approximately 34 million in cash in september 2010  we acquired the remaining noncontrolling interests of diamed france sa for 102 million  euros or approximately 129 million  in cash in january 2010 we acquired certain diagnostic businesses of biotest ag for 45 million euros or approximately 649 million in cash in october 2007  we began acquiring the outstanding shares of diamed holding ag with the final shares purchased in february 2010 for a total consideration over the years of 4643 million of which 86 of the outstanding shares payment was in october 2007 all of these acquisitions are included in our clinical diagnostics segment 

in january 2010  we acquired certain diagnostic businesses of biotest ag biotest for 45 million  euros approximately 649 million  in cash the operating results of these businesses are included in our clinical diagnostics segment 

we continue to review possible acquisitions to expand both our life science and clinical diagnostics segments we routinely meet with the principals or brokers of the subject companies it is not certain that any of these discussions will advance beyond the preliminary stages to completion at this time 

cash flows from financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities was 2136 million  in 2011  and net cash provided by financing activities was 2287 million  and 2939 million  in 2010  and 2009  respectively cash used in 2011 was attributable to the redemption in january 2011 of our 2250 million 75 senior subordinated notes including a call premium of 28 million that was recorded in interest expense in the consolidated statements of income cash provided in 2010 was primarily due to issuing 4250 million senior notes that were used to retire our 2014 bonds and our 2013 bonds in december 2010 and january 2011 respectively net cash provided by financing activities in 2009 was primarily due to biorad issuing 3000 million of 80 senior subordinated notes in may 2009 which yielded net proceeds of 2948 million at an effective rate of 83 we have outstanding senior notes of 4250 million and senior subordinated notes of 3000 million which are not due until 2020 and 2016 respectively 

the credit agreement that was entered into in june 2010 is secured by substantially all of our personal property assets the assets of our domestic subsidiaries and 65 of the capital stock of certain foreign subsidiaries it is guaranteed by all of our existing and future material domestic subsidiaries and expires in june 2014 

the board of directors has authorized the repurchase of up to 18 million of biorads common stock over an indefinite period of time of which 33 million has yet to be repurchased the credit agreement and the indenture governing our 80 senior subordinated notes restrict our ability to repurchase our stock we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock during 2011  2010  or 2009

we do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements that have had or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

contractual obligations 

the following summarizes certain of our contractual obligations as of december 31 2011  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our cash flows in future periods in millions 



recent accounting standards updates 

in may 2011 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued guidance in regard to fair value measurement the new guidance results in a consistent definition of fair value and common requirements for measurement of and disclosure about fair value between gaap and international financial reporting standards ifrs this guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december 15 2011 we do not anticipate that the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

in june 2011 the fasb issued guidance in regard to the presentation of comprehensive income in the new guidance an entity has the option to present the total of comprehensive income the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements in december 2011 the fasb deferred the new requirement to present components of reclassifications of other comprehensive income on the face of the income statement this guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december 15 2011 biorad is currently evaluating the alternative presentations however the adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements as it relates to required disclosures and presentation only 

in september 2011 the fasb issued guidance in regard to goodwill impairment the new guidance is intended to reduce the cost and complexity of the annual goodwill impairment test by providing entities with the option of performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary an entity can choose to perform the qualitative assessment on none some or all of its reporting units moreover an entity can bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to step one of the impairment test and then perform the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period the new guidance is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2011 if adopted we do not expect this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 




 

item 7a quantitive and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

financial risk management 

the main goal of biorad’s financial risk management program is to reduce the variance in expected cash flows arising from unexpected foreign exchange rate and interest rate changes financial exposures are managed through operational means and by using various financial instruments including cash and liquid resources borrowings and forward and spot foreign exchange contracts no derivative financial instruments are entered into for the purpose of trading or speculation company policy requires that all derivative positions are undertaken to manage the risks arising from underlying business activities these derivative transactions do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment per general standards for derivatives and hedging derivative instruments used in these transactions are valued at fair value and changes in fair value are included in reported earnings 

foreign exchange risk   we operate and conduct business in many countries and are exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates we face transactional currency exposures that arise when we enter into transactions denominated in currencies other than us dollars additionally our consolidated net equity is impacted by the conversion of the net assets of our international subsidiaries for which the functional currency is not the us dollar 

foreign currency exposures are managed on a centralized basis this allows for the netting of natural offsets and lowers transaction costs and net exposures where possible we seek to manage our foreign exchange risk in part through operational means including matching samecurrency revenues to same currency costs and samecurrency assets to samecurrency liabilities moreover weakening in one currency can often be offset by strengthening in another currency foreign exchange risk is also managed through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts positions are primarily in euro swiss franc british sterling singapore dollar and japanese yen the majority of forward contracts are for periods of 90 days or less we record the change in value of our foreign currency receivables and payables as a foreign exchange gain loss on our consolidated statements of income along with the change in fair market value of the forward exchange contract used as an economic hedge of those assets or liabilities 

our forward contract holdings at yearend were analyzed to determine their sensitivity to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates all other variables were held constant market risk associated with derivative holdings is the potential change in fair value of derivative positions arising from an adverse movement in foreign exchange rates a decline of 10 on quoted foreign exchange rates would result in an approximate netpresentvalue loss of 35 million  on our derivative position as of december 31 2011  this impact of a change in exchange rates excludes the offset derived from the change in value of the underlying assets and liabilities which could reduce the adverse effect significantly 

interest rate risk of debt instruments   biorad centrally manages the shortterm cash surpluses and shortfalls of its subsidiaries our holdings of variable rate debt instruments at yearend were analyzed to determine their sensitivity to movements in interest rates due to the relatively small amount of shortterm variable rate debt we have outstanding there would not be a material impact to earnings or cash flows if interest rates moved adversely by 10 our longterm debt consists primarily of fixedrate instruments and is thus insulated from interest rate changes as of december 31 2011  the overall interest rate risk associated with our debt was not significant

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

as of the end of the period covered by this report we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures based on that evaluation our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that material information relating to biorad is made known to management including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer 

we have determined that the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting that was previously disclosed as of december 31 2010 was remediated as of december 31 2011 as stated in “item 9a controls and procedures” contained in our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2010 and “item 4 controls and procedures” contained in our quarterly reports on form 10q during 2011 management had identified three significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that when considered and taken together had constituted a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as of those dates these three significant deficiencies were the result of i a number of entitylevel control deficiencies including our lack of a comprehensive fcpa policy and training program our lack of a formal effective disclosure committee to facilitate our compliance with section 302 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 inadequate policies regarding enterprisewide risk assessment and management related to doing business in highrisk emerging markets our failure to perform background checks on certain parties prior to entering into material contracts with such parties our lack of compliance with our existing code of business ethics and conduct in certain countries and ineffective disclosure of significant exceptions to compliance with company policies through our quarterly management subcertification process ii a number of control deficiencies related to our expenditure processes at 

certain of our international subsidiaries and iii a number of control deficiencies related to our revenue and accounts receivable processes at certain of our international subsidiaries 

in response to and following identification of the material weakness management has enhanced the operation of a number of existing controls related to biorads internal control over financial reporting including our previously existing controls and processes for fcpa compliance and implemented additional controls we have determined that these enhancements have remediated the significant deficiencies that when taken and considered together constituted the material weakness described above to the extent that a material weakness no longer exists as of december 31 2011 the enhancements we have implemented include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

implementation of the actions described above and resulting improvements in controls have strengthened internal control over financial reporting and have in particular addressed the related material weakness that was identified as of december 31 2010 and the end of subsequent fiscal quarters as part of the 2011 assessment of internal control over financial reporting management tested and evaluated these additional controls to assess whether they are operating effectively and as of december 31 2011 we determined that such controls were successfully tested and the material weakness was remediated however we continue to have a significant deficiency related to our revenue process and we have identified two additional significant deficiencies with respect to i reagent rental controls at certain of our international subsidiaries and ii multiple controls for various business processes at a more limited number of minor international subsidiaries we are continuing the process of evaluating and 

improving our processes and procedures for fcpa compliance 

changes to internal control over financial reporting 

  

other than the implementation and operation of controls implemented to address the material weakness described above there were no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting   during our most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

managements report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in rule 13a15f under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended exchange act our internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the preparation and fair presentation of our financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles an internal control system over financial reporting has inherent limitations and may not prevent or detect misstatements therefore even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation 

our management has used the criteria set forth in the report entitled “internal control  integrated framework” published by the committee of sponsoring organizations coso of the treadway commission to evaluate the effectiveness of biorads internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2011 

based on that evaluation and assessment our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 2011 to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america our management reviewed the results of its evaluation and assessment with our audit committee 

ernst  young llp an independent registered public accounting firm has audited the consolidated financial statements of biorad laboratories inc for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 and has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of biorads internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2011 as stated in their report

report of independent registered public accounting firm 

the board of directors and shareholders of biorad laboratories inc 

we have audited biorad laboratories inc’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2011  based on criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the coso criteria biorad laboratories inc’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying management’s report on internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

in our opinion biorad laboratories inc maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2011  based on the coso criteria 

we also have audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the consolidated balance sheets of biorad laboratories inc as of   december 31 2011  and 2010  and the related consolidated statements of income cash flows and changes in stockholders equity and comprehensive income for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2011   and our report dated february 29 2012   expressed an unqualified opinion thereon

general

founded in 1952 and incorporated in 1957 biorad laboratories inc referred to in this report as “biorad” “we” “us” and “our” was initially engaged in the development and produc­tion of specialty chemicals used in biochemical pharmaceutical and other life science research applications we entered the field of clinical diagnostics with the development of our first test kit based on separation techniques and materials developed for life science research through internal research and development efforts and acquisitions we have expanded into various markets today biorad manufactures and supplies the life science research healthcare analytical chemistry and other markets with a broad range of products and systems used to separate complex chemical and biological materials and to identify analyze and purify their components

as we broadened our product lines we also expanded our geographical market we have distribution channels in over 30 countries outside the united states through subsidiaries whose focus is customer service and product distribution

description of business 

business segments 

today biorad operates in two industry segments designated as life science and clinical diagnostics both segments operate worldwide our life science segment and our clinical diagnostics segment generated 34 and 66 respectively of our net sales for the year ended december 31 2010 we generated approximately 31 of our consolidated net sales for the year ended december 31 2010 from us sales and approximately 69 from sales in our remaining worldwide markets

for a description of business and financial information on industry and geographic segments see note 13 on pages 63 through 66 of item 8 of part ii of this report

life science segment 

our life science segment is at the forefront of discovery creating advanced tools to answer complex biological questions we are a market leader in our industry developing manufacturing and marketing a range of more than 5000 reagents apparatus and laboratory instruments that serve a global customer base many of our products are used in established research techniques biopharmaceutical production processes and food testing regimes these techniques are typically used to separate purify and identify biological materials such as proteins nucleic acids and bacteria within a laboratory or production setting we focus on selected segments of the life sciences market in proteomics the study of proteins genomics the study of genes biopharmaceutical production cell biology and food safety we estimate that the worldwide market for products in these selected segments is approximately 50 billion our principal life science customers include universities and medical schools industrial research organizations government agencies pharmaceutical manufacturers biotechnology researchers food producers and food testing laboratories

clinical diagnostics segment 

our clinical diagnostics segment designs manufactures sells and supports test systems informatics systems test kits and specialized quality controls that serve clinical laboratories in the global diagnostics market our products currently address specific niches within the in vitro diagnostics “ivd” test market and we focus on the higher margin higher growth segments of this market

we supply more than 3000 different products that cover more than 300 clinical diagnostic tests to the ivd test market we estimate that the worldwide sales for products in the markets we serve were approximately 100 billion ivd tests are conducted outside the human body and are used to identify and measure substances in a patient’s tissue blood or urine our products consist of reagents instruments and software typically provided to our customers as an integrated package to allow them to generate reproducible test results revenue in this business is highly recurring as laboratories typically standardize test methodologies which are dependent on a particular supplier’s reagents and consumable products an installed base of diagnostic test systems creates an ongoing source of revenue through the sale of test kits for each sample analyzed on an installed system our principal clinical diagnostic customers include hospital laboratories reference laboratories transfusion laboratories and physician office laboratories

raw materials and components 

we utilize a wide variety of chemicals biological materials electronic components machined metal parts optical parts minicomputers and peripheral devices most of these materials and components are available from numerous sources and we have not experienced difficulty in securing adequate supplies

patents and trademarks 

we own numerous us and international patents and patent licenses we believe however that our ability to develop and manufacture our products depends primarily on our knowledge technology and special skills we pay royalties on the sales of certain products under several patent license agreements we view these patents and license agreements as valuable assets

seasonal operations and backlog 

our business is not inherently seasonal however the european custom of concentrating vacation during the summer months usually tempers third quarter sales volume and operating income

for the most part we operate in markets characterized by short lead times and the absence of significant backlogs management has concluded that backlog information is not material to our business as a whole

sales and marketin g 

we conduct our worldwide operations through an extensive direct sales force and service network employing more than 1000 sales and service people around the world our sales force typically consists of experienced industry practitioners with scientific training and we maintain a separate specialist sales force for each of our segments our direct sales approach contrasts with the distributor approach used by some of our competitors allowing us to sell a broader range of our products and have more direct contact with our customers

our customer base is broad and diversified our worldwide customer base includes 1 prominent university and research institutions affiliated with more than 100000 scientists in the us alone 2 hospital public health and commercial laboratories 3 other leading diagnostic manufacturers and 4 leading companies in the biotechnology pharmaceutical chemical and food industries in 2010 no single customer accounted for more than two percent of our total net sales our sales are affected by certain external factors for example a number of our customers particularly in the life science segment are substantially dependent on government grants and research contracts for their funding a significant reduction of government funding would have a detrimental effect on the results of this segment

most of our international sales are generated by our whollyowned subsidiaries and their branch offices certain of these subsidiaries also have manufacturing facilities biorad’s international operations are subject to certain risks common to foreign operations in general such as changes in governmental regulations import restrictions and foreign exchange fluctuations however our international operations are principally in developed nations which we regard as presenting no significantly greater risks to our operations than are present in the united states

competition 

the markets served by our product groups are highly competitive our competitors range in size from startups to large multinational corporations with significant resources and reach reliable independent information on sales and market share of products produced by our competitors is not generally available we believe however based on our own estimates no one company is so dominant that it prevents other companies including biorad from competing effectively we compete mainly in market segments where our products and technology offer customers specific advantages over the competition

because of the breadth of its product lines the life science segment does not face the same competitors for all of its products competitors in this market include ge biosciences life technologies millipore and thermo fisher scientific we compete primarily based on meeting performance specifications

major competitors in the clinical diagnostics segment include roche abbott laboratories diagnostic division siemens medical diagnostics solutions beckman coulter bectondickinson biomérieux ortho clinical diagnostics tosoh immucor cepheid and diasorin

research and development 

we conduct extensive research and development activities in all areas of our business employing approximately 780 people worldwide in these activities research and development have played a major role in biorads growth and are expected to continue to do so in the future our research teams are continuously developing new products and new applications for existing products in our development of new products and applications we interact with scientific and medical professionals at universities hospitals and medical schools and in the industry we spent approximately 1723 million 1636 million and 1595 million on research and development activities during the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively

regulatory matters 

the manufacturing marketing and labeling of certain of our products primarily diagnostic products are subject to regulation in the united states by the center for devices and radiological health of the united states food and drug administration fda and in other jurisdictions by state and foreign government authorities fda regulations require that some new products have premarketing approval by the fda and require certain products to be manufactured in accordance with “good manufacturing practices” to be extensively tested and to be properly labeled to disclose test results and performance claims and limitations

as a multinational manufacturer and distributor of sophisticated instrumentation equipment we must meet a wide array of electromagnetic compatibility and safety compliance requirements to satisfy regulations in the united states the european community and other jurisdictions 

our operations are subject to federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations that govern such activities as transportation of goods emissions to air and discharges to water as well as handling and disposal practices for solid hazardous and medical wastes in addition to environmental laws that regulate our operations we are also subject to environmental laws and regulations that create liabilities and cleanup responsibility for spills disposals or other releases of hazardous substances into the environment as a result of our operations or otherwise impacting real property that we own or operate the environmental laws and regulations could also subject us to claims by third parties for damages resulting from any spills disposals or releases resulting from our operations or at any of our properties 

these regulatory requirements vary widely among countries

employees 

at december 31 2010 biorad had approximately 6880 fulltime employees fewer than eight percent of biorads approximately 2870 us employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement which will expire on november 7 2012 many of biorads nonus fulltime employees especially in france are covered by collective bargaining agreements we consider our employee relations in general to be good

 item 1a risk factors 

tableend 

the following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating our business and the forwardlooking information contained in this annual report on form 10k we believe that any of the following risks could have a material affect on our business operations industry financial position or our future financial performance while we believe that we have identified and discussed below the key risk factors affecting our business there may be additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known or that are not currently believed to be significant that may adversely affect our business operations industry financial position and financial performance in the future

the ongoing investigation by our audit committee and by government agencies of possible violations by us of the united states foreign corrupt practices act and similar laws could have a material adverse effect on our business 

based on an internal review we have identified conduct in certain of our overseas operations that may have violated the antibribery provisions of the united states foreign corrupt practices act fcpa and is likely to

have violated the fcpa’s books and records and internal controls provisions and our own internal policies in may 2010 we voluntarily disclosed these matters to the us department of justice doj and the securities and exchange commission sec which each commenced an investigation the audit committee of our board of directors audit committee has assumed direct responsibility for reviewing these matters and has hired experienced independent counsel to conduct an investigation and provide legal advice we have provided and intend to continue to provide additional information to the doj and the sec as the audit committee’s investigation progresses

the audit committee’s investigation and the doj and sec investigations are continuing and we are presently unable to predict the duration scope or results of the audit committee’s investigation of the investigations by the doj or the sec or whether either agency will commence any legal actions the doj and the sec have a broad range of civil and criminal sanctions under the fcpa and other laws and regulations including but not limited to injunctive relief disgorgement fines penalties modifications to business practices including the termination or modification of existing business relationships the imposition of compliance programs and the retention of a monitor to oversee compliance with the fcpa the imposition of any of these sanctions or remedial measures could have a material adverse effect on our business including our results of operations cash balance and credit ratings we have not to date assessed whether any of the activities in question violated the laws of the foreign jurisdictions in which they took place

we have identified three significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2010 that when considered and taken together constitute a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2010 our failure to establish and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could result in our failure to meet our reporting obligations and cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information which in turn could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline 

in connection with our audit committee’s investigation of our compliance with the fcpa discussed above our management identified three significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2010 that when considered and taken together constitute a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2010 a significant deficiency is defined as a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting that is less severe than a material weakness yet important enough to merit attention by those responsible for oversight of our financial reporting a material weakness is defined as a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis

the three significant deficiencies that we identified are the result of i a number of entitylevel control deficiencies including our lack of a comprehensive fcpa policy and training program our lack of a formal effective disclosure committee to facilitate our compliance with section 302 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 inadequate policies regarding enterprisewide risk assessment and management related to doing business in highrisk emerging markets our failure to perform background checks on certain parties prior to entering into material contracts with such parties our lack of compliance with our existing code of business ethics and conduct in certain countries and ineffective disclosure of significant exceptions to compliance with company policies through our quarterly management subcertification process ii a number of control deficiencies related to our expenditure processes at certain of our international subsidiaries and iii a number of control deficiencies related to our revenue and accounts receivable process at certain of our international subsidiaries for more information about these three significant deficiencies and the resulting material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting and the remediation efforts that we have initiated and intend to initiate to attempt to remediate these three significant deficiencies and the resulting material weakness please see item 9a “controls and procedures” in this report

we cannot assure you that we will be able to remediate these significant deficiencies and the resulting material weakness or that additional significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting will not be identified in the future any failure to maintain or implement new or improved internal controls or any difficulties that we may encounter in their maintenance or implementation could result in additional significant deficiencies or material weaknesses result in material misstatements in our financial statements and cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations which in turn could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline any such failure could also adversely affect the results of our periodic management evaluations and annual auditor attestation reports regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting required by section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002

adverse changes in general domestic and worldwide economic conditions and instability and disruption of credit markets could adversely affect our operating results financial condition or liquidity 

recent global market and economic conditions have been unprecedented and challenging with tighter credit conditions slower growth and recession in most major economies although signs of recovery may exist there are continued concerns about the systemic impact of inflation the availability and cost of credit a declining real estate market and geopolitical issues that contribute to increased market volatility and uncertain expectations for the global economy these conditions combined with declining business activity levels and consumer confidence increased unemployment and volatile oil prices contributed to unprecedented levels of volatility in the capital markets in recent years any additional continued or recurring disruptions in the capital and credit markets may adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition

as a result of these market conditions the cost and availability of credit has been and may continue to be adversely affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads concern about the stability of the markets generally and the strength of counterparties specifically has led many lenders and institutional investors to reduce and in some cases cease to provide credit to businesses and consumers these factors have led to a decrease in spending by businesses and consumers alike our customers and vendors may experience cash flow concerns and as a result customers may modify delay or cancel plans to purchase our products and vendors may increase their prices reduce their output or change terms of sales additionally if customers’ or vendors’ operating and financial performance deteriorates or if they are unable to make scheduled payments or obtain credit customers may not be able to pay or may delay payment of amounts owed to us

vendors may restrict credit or impose less favorable payment terms any inability of current andor potential customers to pay us for our products or any demands by vendors for accelerated payment terms may adversely affect our earnings and cash flow additionally strengthening of the us dollar associated with the global financial crisis may adversely affect the results of our international operations when those results are translated into us dollars

furthermore the disruption in the credit markets could impede our access to capital especially if we are unable to maintain our current credit ratings should we have limited access to additional financing sources when needed we may decide to defer capital expenditures or seek other higher cost sources of liquidity which may or may not be available to us on acceptable terms continued turbulence in the us and international markets and economies and prolonged declines in business and consumer spending may adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition and the liquidity and financial condition of our customers including our ability to refinance maturing liabilities and access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs

we cannot assure you that we will be able to integrate acquired companies products or technologies into our company successfully or we may not be able to realize the anticipated benefits from the acquisitions 

as part of our overall business strategy we pursue acquisitions of and investments in complementary companies products and technologies in order to be successful in these activities we must among other things

 

the benefits of any acquisition may prove to be less than anticipated and may not outweigh the costs reported in our financial statements completing any potential future acquisition could cause significant diversion of our management’s time and resources if we acquire new companies products or technologies we may be required to assume contingent liabilities or record impairment charges for goodwill and other intangible assets over time we cannot assure you that we will successfully overcome these risks or any other problems we encounter in connection with any acquisitions and any such acquisitions could adversely affect our business financial position or operating results

the industries and market segments in which we operate are highly competitive and we may not be able to compete effectively with larger companies with greater financial resources than we have 

the life science and clinical diagnostics markets are each highly competitive some of our competitors have greater financial resources than we do and are less leveraged than we are making them better equipped to license technologies and intellectual property from third parties or to fund research and development manufacturing and marketing efforts moreover competitive and regulatory conditions in many markets in which we operate restrict our ability to fully recover through price increases higher costs of acquired goods and services resulting from inflation and other drivers of cost increases our competitors can be expected to continue to improve the design and performance of their products and to introduce new products with competitive price and performance characteristics maintaining these advantages will require us to continue to invest in research and development sales and marketing and customer service and support we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient resources to continue to make such investments or that we will be successful in maintaining such advantages

we have significant international operations which subject us to various risks such as general economic and market conditions in the countries in which we operate 

a significant portion of our sales are made outside of the united states our foreign subsidiaries generated 69 of our net sales for the year ended december 31 2010 our international operations are subject to risks common to foreign operations such as general economic and market conditions in the countries in which we operate changes in governmental regulations political instability import restrictions and currency exchange rate risks we cannot assure you that shifts in currency exchange rates especially significant strengthening of the us dollar compared to the euro will not have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition

we are dependent on government funding and the capital spending programs of our customers and the effect of healthcare reform on government funding and our customers’ ability to purchase our products is uncertain 

our customers include universities clinical diagnostics laboratories government agencies hospitals and pharmaceutical biotechnology and chemical companies the capital spending programs of these institutions and companies have a significant effect on the demand for our products such policies are based on a wide

variety of factors including the resources available to make such purchases the availability of funding from grants by governments or government agencies the spending priorities among various types of equipment and the policies regarding capital expenditures during industry downturns or recessionary periods if government funding to our customers were to decrease or if our customers were to decrease or reallocate their budgets in a manner adverse to us our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected

healthcare reform and the growth of managed care organizations have been and continue to be significant factors in the clinical diagnostics market the trend towards managed care together with healthcare reform of the delivery system in the united states and efforts to reform in europe has resulted in increased pressure on healthcare providers and other participants in the healthcare industry to reduce costs consolidation among healthcare providers has resulted in fewer more powerful groups whose purchasing power gives them cost containment leverage these competitive forces place constraints on the levels of overall pricing and thus could have a material adverse effect on our profit margins for products we sell in clinical diagnostics markets to the extent that the healthcare industry seeks to address the need to contain costs by limiting the number of clinical tests being performed our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected if these changes in the healthcare markets in the united states and europe continue we could be forced to alter our approach in selling marketing distributing and servicing our products

our failure to improve our product offerings and develop and introduce new products may negatively impact our business 

our future success depends on our ability to continue to improve our product offerings and develop and introduce new product lines and extensions that integrate new technological advances if we are unable to integrate technological advances into our product offerings or to design develop manufacture and market new product lines and extensions successfully and in a timely manner our operating results will be adversely affected we cannot assure you that our product and process development efforts will be successful or that new products we introduce will achieve market acceptance

if we experience a disruption of our information technology systems or if we fail to successfully implement manage and integrate our information technology and reporting systems it could harm our business 

our information technology it systems are an integral part of our business and a serious disruption of our it systems could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations we depend on our it systems to process orders manage inventory and collect accounts receivable our it systems also allow us to efficiently purchase products from our suppliers and ship products to our customers on a timely basis maintain costeffective operations and provide customer service we cannot assure you that our contingency plans will allow us to operate at our current level of efficiency

our ability to implement our business plan in a rapidly evolving market requires effective planning reporting and analytical processes we expect that we will need to continue to improve and further integrate our it systems reporting systems and operating procedures by training and educating our employees with respect to these improvements and integrations on an ongoing basis in order to effectively run our business if we fail to successfully manage and integrate our it systems reporting systems and operating procedures it could adversely affect our business or operating results

risks relating to intellectual property rights may negatively impact our business 

we rely on a combination of copyright trade secret patent and trademark laws and thirdparty nondisclosure agreements to protect our intellectual property rights and products however we cannot assure you that our intellectual property rights will not be challenged invalidated circumvented or rendered unenforceable or that meaningful protection or adequate remedies will be available to us for instance it may be possible for

unauthorized third parties to copy our intellectual property to reverse engineer or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary or to develop equivalent technologies independently additionally third parties may assert patent copyright and other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to us if we are unable to license or otherwise access protected technology used in our products or if we lose our rights under any existing licenses we could be prohibited from manufacturing and marketing such products we may find it necessary to enforce our patents or other intellectual property rights or to defend ourselves against claimed infringement of the rights of others through litigation which could result in substantial costs to us and divert our resources we also could incur substantial costs to redesign our products to defend any legal action taken against us or to pay damages to an infringed party the foregoing matters could adversely impact our business

we are subject to substantial government regulation 

some of our products primarily diagnostic products production processes and marketing are subject to federal state local and foreign regulation including the fda and its foreign counterparts we are also subject to government regulation of the use and handling of a number of materials and controlled substances failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in substantial liability to us suspension or cessation of our operations restrictions on our ability to expand at our present locations or require us to make significant capital expenditures or incur other significant expenses

we are currently subject to environmental regulations and enforcement proceedings 

our operations are subject to federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations that govern such activities as transportation of goods emissions to air and discharges to water as well as handling and disposal practices for solid hazardous and medical wastes in addition to environmental laws that regulate our operations we are also subject to environmental laws and regulations that create liability and cleanup responsibility for spills disposals or other releases of hazardous substances into the environment as a result of our operations or otherwise impacting real property that we own or operate the environmental laws and regulations also subject us to claims by third parties for damages resulting from any spills disposals or releases resulting from our operations or at any of our properties

we may in the future incur capital and operating costs to comply with currently existing laws and regulations and possible new statutory enactments and these expenditures may be significant we have incurred and may in the future incur fines related to environmental matters and liability for costs or damages related to spills or other releases of hazardous substances into the environment at sites where we have operated or at offsite locations where we have sent hazardous substances for disposal we can provide no assurance however that such matters or any future obligations to comply with environmental laws and regulations will not have a material impact on our operations or financial condition

loss of key personnel could hurt our business 

our products and services are highly technical in nature in general only highly qualified and trained scientists have the necessary skills to develop and market our products and provide our services in addition some of our manufacturing positions are highly technical we face intense competition for these professionals from our competitors customers marketing partners and other companies throughout our industry we generally do not enter into employment agreements requiring these employees to continue in our employment for any period of time any failure on our part to hire train and retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel could substantially damage our business additionally if we were to lose a sufficient number of our research and development scientists and were unable to replace them or satisfy our needs for research and development through outsourcing it could adversely affect our business

a significant majority of our voting stock is held by the schwartz family which could lead to conflicts of interest 

we have two classes of voting stock class a common stock and class b common stock with a few exceptions holders of class a and class b common stock vote as a single class when voting as a single class each share of class a common stock is entitled to onetenth of a vote while each share of class b common stock has one vote in the election or removal of directors the classes vote separately and the holders of class a common stock are entitled to elect 25 of the board of directors with holders of class b common stock electing the remaining directors

as of february 15 2011 the schwartz family collectively held approximately 16 of our class a common stock and 90 of our class b common stock as a result the schwartz family is able to elect a majority of the directors effect fundamental changes in our direction and control matters affecting us including the allocation of business opportunities that may be suitable for our company in addition this concentration of ownership and voting power may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company 

the schwartz family may exercise its control over us according to interests that are different from other investors’ or debtors’ interests

our business could be adversely impacted if we have deficiencies in our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting 

the design and effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting may not prevent all errors misstatements or misrepresentations we cannot assure you that our disclosure controls and procedures over internal control of financial reporting will be effective in accomplishing all control objectives all of the time deficiencies particularly a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting which may occur in the future could result in misstatements of our results of operations restatements of our financial statements a decline in our stock price or otherwise materially adversely affect our business reputation results of operation financial condition or liquidity

natural disasters terrorist attacks or acts of war may cause damage or disruption to us and our employees facilities information systems security systems vendors and customers which could significantly impact our net sales costs and expenses and financial condition 

we have significant manufacturing and distribution facilities particularly in the western united states france and switzerland in particular the western united states has experienced a number of earthquakes wildfires floods landslides and other natural disasters in recent years the occurrences could damage or destroy our facilities which may result in interruptions to our business and losses that exceed our insurance coverage terrorist attacks such as those that occurred on september 11 2001 have contributed to economic instability in the united states and further acts of terrorism bioterrorism violence or war could affect the markets in which we operate our business operations our expectations and other forwardlooking statements contained or incorporated in this document any of these events could cause a decrease in our revenue earnings and cash flows

we may incur losses in future periods due to writedowns in the value of financial instruments 

we have positions in a variety of financial instruments including asset backed securities and other similar instruments financial markets are quite volatile and the markets for these securities can be illiquid the value of these securities will continue to be impacted by external market factors including default rates changes in the value of the underlying property such as residential or commercial real estate rating agency actions the prices at which observable market transactions occur and the financial strength of various entities such as

financial guarantors who provide insurance for the securities should we need to convert these positions to cash we may not be able to sell these instruments without significant losses due to current debtor financial conditions or other market considerations

 

as of december 31 2010 we and our subsidiaries have approximately 9643 million of outstanding indebtedness in addition we are permitted to incur additional debt provided we comply with the limitation on the incurrence of additional indebtedness and disqualified capital stock covenants contained in the indenture governing our senior subordinated notes due 2016 80 notes 

the following chart shows certain important credit statistics

 

our incurrence of substantial amounts of debt may have important consequences for instance it could 

 

our ability to satisfy our obligations and to reduce our total debt depends on our future operating performance and on economic financial competitive and other factors many of which are beyond our control our business may not generate sufficient cash flow and future financings may not be available to provide sufficient net proceeds to meet these obligations or to successfully execute our business strategy

our existing credit facility the indenture governing our 80 notes and the terms of our other debt instruments including agreements we may enter in the future contain or will contain covenants imposing significant restrictions on our business these restrictions may affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise these covenants place restrictions on our ability to among other things

 

 

our existing credit facility also requires that we meet certain financial tests and maintain certain financial ratios including a maximum consolidated leverage ratio test minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio test and a minimum net worth test

our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control including prevailing economic financial and industry conditions the breach of any of these restrictions could result in a default an event of default under our debt agreements would permit some of our lenders to declare all amounts borrowed from them to be due and payable together with accrued and unpaid interest if we were unable to repay debt to our senior secured lenders these lenders could proceed against the collateral securing that debt the collateral is substantially all of our personal property assets the assets of our domestic subsidiaries and 65 of the capital stock of certain of our foreign subsidiaries in addition acceleration of our other indebtedness may cause us to be unable to make interest payments on our outstanding notes and repay the principal amount of our outstanding notes or may cause the future subsidiary guarantors if any to be unable to make payments under the guarantees

based on an internal review we have identified conduct in certain of our overseas operations that may have violated the antibribery provisions of the united states foreign corrupt practices act fcpa and is likely to have violated the fcpa’s books and records and internal controls provisions and our own internal policies in may 2010 we voluntarily disclosed these matters to the us department of justice doj and the securities and exchange commission sec which each commenced an investigation the audit committee of our board of directors audit committee has assumed direct responsibility for reviewing these matters and has hired experienced independent counsel to conduct an investigation and provide legal advice we have provided and intend to continue to provide additional information to the doj and the sec as the audit committee’s investigation progresses 

the audit committee’s investigation and the doj and sec investigations are continuing and we are presently unable to predict the duration scope or results of the audit committee’s investigation of the investigations by the doj or the sec or whether either agency will commence any legal actions the doj and the sec have a broad range of civil and criminal sanctions under the fcpa and other laws and regulations including but not limited to injunctive relief disgorgement fines penalties modifications to business practices including the termination or modification of existing business relationships the imposition of compliance programs and the retention of a monitor to oversee compliance with the fcpa we are unable to estimate the outcome of this matter however the imposition of any of these sanctions or remedial measures could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition we have not to date assessed whether any of the activities in question violated the laws of the foreign jurisdictions in which they took place 

in addition we are party to various other claims legal actions and complaints arising in the ordinary course of business we do not believe at this time that any ultimate liability resulting from any of these other matters will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or liquidity however we cannot give any assurance regarding the ultimate outcome of these other matters and their resolution could be material to our operating results for any particular period depending on the level of income for the period

this discussion should be read in conjunction with the information contained in our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes which are an integral part of the statements

other than statements of historical fact statements made in this annual report include forwardlooking statements such as statements with respect to our future financial performance operating results plans and objectives that involve risk and uncertainties forwardlooking statements generally can be identified by the use of forwardlooking terminology such as “believe” “expect” “may” “will” “intend” “estimate” “continue” or similar expressions or the negative of those terms or expressions such statements involve risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to vary materially from those expressed in or indicated by the forwardlooking statements we have based these forwardlooking statements on our current expectations and projections about future events however actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated depending on a variety of risk factors including among other things changes in general domestic and worldwide economic conditions our ability to successfully develop and market new products our reliance on and access to necessary intellectual property our ability to successfully integrate any acquired business our substantial leverage and ability to service our debt competition in and government regulation of the industries in which we operate and the monetary policies of various countries we caution you not to place undue reliance on forwardlooking statements which reflect an analysis only and speak only as of the date hereof we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise except as required by federal securities law

overview  we are a multinational manufacturer and worldwide distributor of our own life science research and clinical diagnostics products our business is organized into two primary segments life science and clinical diagnostics with the mission to provide customers with specialized tools needed for biological research and clinical diagnostics

we sell more than 8000 products and services to a diverse client base comprised of scientific research healthcare industry education and government customers worldwide we manufacture and supply our customers with a range of reagents apparatus and equipment to separate complex chemical and biological materials and to identify analyze and purify components because our customers rely on consistency for their experiments and test results we believe that more than 70 of our revenue is considered recurring

we continue to build upon our worldwide reputation for quality innovative products and wellrecognized brand names within our industry our reach is global as we currently provide products and services to more than 85000 customers in 130 countries worldwide approximately 31 of our 2010 consolidated net sales are from the united states and approximately 69 are from international locations the international sales are largely denominated in local currencies such as euros swiss franc japanese yen singapore dollar and british sterling as a result our consolidated net sales expressed in dollars benefit when the us dollar weakens and suffer when the us dollar strengthens when the us dollar strengthens we benefit from lower cost of sales from our own international manufacturing sites as well as nonus suppliers and from lower international operating expenses

on january 6 2010 we acquired certain diagnostic businesses of biotest ag biotest this 45 million euro approximately 649 million acquisition broadened our product offering in the area of immunohematology and provided access to the us markets for these products

the following shows cost of goods sold gross profit expense items and net income as a percentage of net sales

 

we intend that the discussions of critical accounting policies and estimates and recent accounting pronouncements that follow will assist you in understanding how such principles estimates and accounting pronouncements affect our financial condition and results of operations as well as significant factors that caused changes in our financial condition and results of operations for the years ended december 31 2010 and 2009

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the accompanying discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities and contingencies as of the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis we base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources however future events may cause us to change our assumptions and estimates which may require adjustment actual results could differ from these estimates we have determined that for the periods reported in this annual report on form 10k the following accounting policies and estimates are critical in understanding our financial condition and results of operations

accounting for income taxes management is required to make estimates related to our income tax provision in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate this process involves estimating our current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within our consolidated balance sheets management then assesses the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent management believes that recovery is not likely a valuation allowance must be established to the extent management establishes a valuation allowance or increases this allowance in a period an increase to expense within the provision for income taxes in the consolidated statements of income may result

we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements on a particular tax position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than a 50 likelihood of being realized upon settlement the amount of unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted as appropriate for changes in facts and circumstances such as significant amendments to existing tax law new regulations or interpretations by the taxing authorities new information obtained during a tax examination or resolution of an examination we recognize both accrued interest and penalties where appropriate related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 

significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded in connection with the deferred tax assets we have recorded a valuation allowance of 370 million and 379 million as of december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize some of the deferred tax assets primarily consisting of certain foreign net operating losses carried forward the valuation allowance is based on management’s current estimates of taxable income for the jurisdictions in which we operate and the period over which the deferred tax assets will be recoverable in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or these estimates are adjusted in future periods an additional valuation allowance may need to be established which would increase the tax provision lowering income and impacting our financial position should realization of these previously reserved deferred tax assets occur the provision for income taxes may decrease raising income and positively impacting biorad’s financial position

valuation of goodwill and longlived assets goodwill represents the excess of the cost over the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses goodwill amounts are assigned to reporting units at the time of acquisition and are adjusted for any subsequent significant transfers of business between reporting units we assess the impairment of goodwill annually in the fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable we perform the impairment tests of goodwill at our reporting unit level which is one level below our reporting segments the goodwill impairment test consists of a twostep process the first step of the goodwill impairment test used to identify potential impairment compares the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is not required the second step if required compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill the fair value of a reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the price paid to acquire the reporting unit if the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value an impairment charge is recognized in an amount equal to that excess

we use projected discounted cash flow models to determine the fair value of a reporting unit the discounted cash value projected for goodwill may be different from the fair value that would result from an actual transaction between a willing buyer and a willing seller projections such as discounted cash flow models are inherently uncertain and accordingly actual future cash flows may differ materially from projected cash flows management judgment is required in developing the assumptions for the discounted cash flow model these assumptions include revenue growth rates profit margins future capital expenditures working capital needs expected foreign currency rates discount rates and terminal values we estimate future cash flows using current and longterm high level strategic financial forecasts these forecasts take into account the current economic environment the discount rates used are compiled using independent sources current trends in similar businesses and other observable market data changes to these rates might result in material changes in the valuation and determination of the recoverability of goodwill for example an increase in the discount rate used to discount cash flows will decrease the computed fair value in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test we apply a 10 decrease to the fair value of each reporting unit

to validate the reasonableness of the reporting unit fair values we reconcile the aggregate fair values of the reporting units to the enterprise market capitalization including an implied control premium in performing the reconciliation we may depending on the volatility of the market value of our stock price use either the stock price on the valuation date or the average stock price over a range of dates around the valuation date we compare the implied control premium to premiums paid in observable recent transactions of comparable companies to determine if the fair values of the reporting units are reasonable

for purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment loss a longlived asset or assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities we assess the impairment of longlived assets including identifiable intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable factors that we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include

 

when management determines that the carrying value of longlived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment we test for any impairment based on a projected undiscounted cash flow method projected future operating results and cash flows of the asset or asset group are used to establish the fair value used in evaluating the carrying value of longlived and intangible assets we estimate the future cash flows of the longlived assets using current and longterm financial forecasts the carrying amount of a longlived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset if this is the case an impairment loss would be recognized the impairment loss recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value

in 2009 and 2008 our reviews indicated impairment charges of 38 million and 16 million respectively related to the developed technology intangible assets of certain product lines that were acquired in 2006 also in 2008 our review indicated an impairment charge of 272 million related to goodwill from a 1999 acquisition the goodwill impairment was caused primarily by the continuing decline in the bse bovine spongiform encephalopathy product line there were no impairment losses recorded in 2010

valuation of inventories we value inventory at the lower of the actual cost to purchase andor manufacture the inventory or the current estimated realizable value of the inventory we review inventory quantities on hand and reduce the cost basis of excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on an estimated forecast of product demand production requirements and the quality efficacy and potency of raw materials this review is done on a quarterly basis or if warranted by the circumstances more frequently in addition our industry is characterized by technological change frequent new product development and product obsolescence that could result in an increase in the amount of obsolete inventory quantities on hand our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate and if too high we may have overstated the carrying value of our inventory in the future if inventory is determined to be overvalued we would be required to write down the value of inventory to market and recognize such costs in our cost of goods sold at the time of such determination therefore although we make efforts to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand and perform procedures to safeguard overall inventory quality any significant unanticipated changes in demand technological developments regulations storage conditions or other environment factors affecting biological materials could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and reported results of operations

valuation of investments we regularly review our investments for factors that may indicate that a decline in the fair value of an investment below its carrying value is otherthantemporary some factors considered in evaluating whether or not a decline in fair value is otherthantemporary include our ability and intent to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for a recovery in value the duration and extent to which the fair value has been less than cost and the financial condition and prospects of the issuer such reviews are inherently uncertain in that the value of the investment may not fully recover or may decline further in future periods resulting in realized losses

warranty reserves we warrant certain equipment against defects in design materials and workmanship generally for a period of one year upon delivery and on acceptance of that equipment we establish as part of cost of goods sold a provision for the expected costs of such warranty repairs based on historical experience specific warranty terms and customer feedback a review is performed on a quarterly basis to assess the adequacy of our warranty reserve and it is adjusted if necessary the warranty reserve is based on actual experience and expected future costs to be incurred should realized costs be higher than expected costs cost of goods sold would be lower in the period of estimation and higher when realized

allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the collectibility of our customer accounts the amount of the allowance is determined by analyzing known uncollectible accounts the age of our receivables economic conditions in the customers’ country or industry historical losses and our customers’ general creditworthiness amounts later determined and specifically identified to be uncollectible are charged or written off against this allowance uncertainty in the current economic environment if prolonged could result in greater amounts becoming uncollectible in the future should the estimates of losses be higher than the actual uncollectible accounts we would report lower profitability when the estimates are made and higher profitability when the receivable is collected

litigation accruals we record as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets estimated amounts for claims that are probable and can be reasonably estimated the likelihood of a material change in these estimated reserves is dependent on the possible outcome of settlement negotiations regulatory or judicial review and the development of facts and circumstances in extended litigation which could change claims or assessments when both the amount and range of loss on some outstanding litigation is uncertain we disclose in the footnotes of the financial statements when we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of a material liability that could result from unfavorable outcomes in litigation as events occur we will assess the potential liability related to our pending litigation and revise our estimates such revisions could materially impact our results of operations

corporate results  sales gross margins and expenses 

net sales 

n et sales sales in 2010 increased 80 to 193 billion from 178 billion in 2009 with biotest contributing approximately 561 million to the growth in sales foreign currency had minimal impact on total sales growth excluding the additional sales from the biotest acquisition 2010 sales grew by 48 on a currency neutral basis currency neutral sales growth excluding biotest was achieved in all regions but was primarily driven by growth in asia pacific eastern europe and latin america 

the life science segment sales in 2010 were 6481 million an increase of 26 or 22 on a currency neutral basis compared to 2009 sales growth was primarily attributed to realtime pcr products and a new product line tc 10 tm   automated cell counter partially offset by general market weakness especially in europe currency neutral sales growth in the life science segment was primarily in asia pacific eastern europe latin america and north america while european sales declined

the clinical diagnostics segment reported sales in 2010 of 127 billion an increase of 110 compared to 2009 with biotest contributing approximately 49 to the sales growth on a currency neutral basis sales in 2010 increased 113 including biotest compared to 2009 clinical diagnostics realized growth in its quality controls product line and in immunohematology before the inclusion of biotest diabetes and bioplex ® 2200 instruments and reagents sales growth was primarily in asia pacific eastern europe and latin america and to a lesser extent north america

our net sales increased by 11 in 2009 to 178 billion as compared to 2008 excluding the impact of foreign currency 2009 sales increased by approximately 55 compared to 2008 currency neutral sales growth was generated primarily in the regions of asia pacific the united states and developing or emerging markets in eastern europe and latin america diamed holding ag diamed distributors acquired in late 2008 and early 2009 also contributed to sales growth

the life science segment sales decreased 19 in 2009 as compared to 2008 on a currency neutral basis sales increased 08 the decline in sales of bse bovine spongiform encephalopathy products continued in 2009 as both product prices and governmentmandated tests declined excluding the impact of the bse product line the life science segment grew by 13 in 2009 as compared to 2008 product groups that showed growth included realtime pcr instruments and reagents the proteon tm protein interaction analysis system and the biotechnology explorer tm program sales growth in the life science segment was primarily in asia pacific latin america and the us while european sales represented the majority of declining sales

the clinical diagnostics segment achieved sales growth of 30 in 2009 as compared to 2008 excluding the impact of foreign currency sales increased 85 compared to 2008 most clinical diagnostics major product lines showed sales growth such as bioplex 2200 systems quality controls and blood virus products there was a decline in sales of contract manufacturing as some of these contracts were not renewed on a regional basis currency neutral sales growth was primarily provided by asia pacific the united states and emerging markets including latin america partially offset by sales declines in europe

gross margin 

consolidated gross margins were 566 in 2010 compared to 560 in 2009 life science segment gross margins in 2010 improved from 2009 by approximately 24 the increase was primarily due to improved manufacturing overhead absorption reduction in costs and a favorable product mix toward higher margin products clinical diagnostics segment gross margins in 2010 decreased by approximately 04 from 2009 the biotest acquisition had a negative impact on clinical diagnostics segment gross margins due to higher inventory values resulting from purchase accounting and overall lower margins than historically achieved by the segment partially offsetting this decrease in gross margins was a favorable settlement of intellectual property disputes and lower royalty expenses

consolidated gross margins were 560 in 2009 compared to 546 in 2008 life science segment gross margins improved in 2009 compared to 2008 by 01 the improvement was the result of better manufacturing overhead absorption from a reduction in costs the move of new products to more cost efficient offshore manufacturing and sales mix favoring higher margin reagents rather than instruments with typically lower margin clinical diagnostics segment gross margins improved by approximately 22 in 2009 compared to 2008 improvements included lower royalty payments paid to licensors as a result of the expiration of patents in blood virus and immunohematology products increased margin from the acquisition of diamed distributors and the reduction of the impact of diamed preacquisition inventory subject to purchase accounting rules additionally the bioplex 2200 margins improved from greater placements and higher test volume

selling general and administrative expense 

consolidated selling general and administrative expense sga represented 330 of sales in 2010 compared to 337 of sales in 2009 the growth rate in absolute sga spending was less than the rate of sales growth moderation in spending for employee related costs and third party commissions lowered the rate of sga spending to sales absolute dollar increases in sga were primarily in employeerelated costs travel and related costs and professional services

consolidated sga represented 337 of net sales for 2009 compared to 335 of net sales in 2008 growth in absolute sga spending was proportional to sales the clinical diagnostics segment grew sga at a slightly lower rate than the growth in its sales while the life science segment’s reduced rate of spending in sga was larger than the decline in its sales absolute dollar increases in sga were primarily in employeerelated expenses and purchased intangibles amortization partially offset by lower travel costs and professional services

research and development expense was 1723 million in 2010 or 89 of sales compared to 92 of sales in 2009 both the life science and clinical diagnostics segments research and development expense increased in absolute dollars however as a percent of sales clinical diagnostics segment expense decreased from 2009 life science segment efforts concentrated on genomics proteomics process chromatography and food diagnostics applications the majority of the clinical diagnostics segment increase was related to an additional emphasis in diabetes monitoring clinical microbiology expanded blood virus diagnostic tests and improved automation

research and development expense was 1636 million in 2009 or 92 of sales compared to 90 of sales in 2008 life science segment development efforts were directed towards genomics proteomics and process chromatography applications clinical diagnostics segment development efforts were focused on expanded tests for the bioplex 2200 testing platform as well as other enhancements to existing automation and reagents used for immunohematology clinical microbiology and blood virus diagnostic tests and additional quality control products in absolute dollars the increase was in the clinical diagnostic segment partially offset by a decrease in the life science segment

corporate results – nonoperating 

interest expense 

interest expense in 2010 increased 355 to 637 million compared to 2009 the increase in interest expense in 2010 from 2009 was primarily due to the payment of a call premium and the expensing of unamortized debt issuance costs for the redemption of the 2000 million of 6125 senior subordinated notes in december 2010 and the interest associated with the 300 million of 80 senior subordinated notes due in 2016 that were issued in may 2009 our other principal debt obligation was the 2250 million 75 senior subordinated notes which were redeemed in january 2011

interest expense in 2009 increased 464 to 470 million when compared to 2008 the additional 3000 million of 80 senior subordinated notes that were issued in may 2009 had increased our indebtedness to 7426 million at december 31 2009 which increased our interest expense in 2009 compared to 2008

foreign currency exchange gains and losses 

foreign currency exchange gains and losses consist of foreign currency transaction gains and losses on intercompany net receivables and payables and the change in fair value of our forward foreign exchange contracts used to manage our foreign currency exchange risk net foreign currency exchange losses for 2010 2009 and 2008 were  39 million 50 million and 76 million respectively the 2010 and 2009 net foreign currency exchange losses were attributable to greater market volatility costs to hedge and the result of the estimating process inherent in the timing of shipments and payments of intercompany debt the 2008 net loss reflected a number of unhedged european based intercompany loans denominated in euros british sterling and swiss francs which arose as part of our acquisitions in december 2008 the significant volatility in december 2008 resulted in an approximate 3 million noncash loss on these accounts additionally we recorded a 2008 loss of 16 million on unhedged intercompany payables for our brazilian subsidiaries which we have not historically hedged due to the high cost all years are affected by the economic hedging program we employ to hedge our intercompany receivables and payables

other income and expense net 

other income and expense net for 2010 includes investment and dividend income generally interest income on our cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and long term marketable securities other income net in 2010 was 39 million compared to 69 million in 2009 the decrease primarily resulted from nonrecurring income of 46 million in 2009 related to the relief of a foreign nonincome based tax obligation partially offset by higher otherthantemporary impairment of investments in 2009 than in 2010

other income net in 2009 was 69 million compared to other expense net of 04 million in 2008 the 2009 other income net included a relief of 46 million for a foreign nonincome based tax obligation higher interest and dividend income and lower charges for impairment on investments compared to 2008

effective tax rate 

our effective tax rate was 15 and 20 in 2010 and 2009 respectively the effective tax rates in 2010 and 2009 both reflected tax benefits for nontaxable dividend income research and development tax credits and differences between us and foreign rates the lower effective tax rate in 2010 was primarily due to a benefit of approximately 224 million that related to us foreign tax credits associated with a 1639 million distribution of earnings from our foreign affiliates to the us

our effective tax rate was 20 and 31 in 2009 and 2008 respectively the decrease was primarily related to the completion in the fourth quarter of 2009 of a us income tax examination covering the years 2001 through 2005 favorable tax rates associated with higher earnings from operations in lowertax jurisdictions throughout the world and a reduction in our balance of unrecognized tax benefits due to lapses of statutes 

our effective tax rate may be impacted in the future either favorably or unfavorably by many factors including but not limited to statutory tax rates changes in tax laws or regulations tax audits and settlements and generation of tax credits

liquidity and capital resources 

biorad operates and conducts business globally primarily through subsidiary companies established in the markets in which we trade goods are manufactured in a small number of locations and are then shipped to local distribution facilities around the world our product mix is diversified and certain products compete largely on product efficacy while others compete on price gross margins are generally sufficient to exceed normal operating costs funding for research and development of new products as well as routine outflows for capital expenditures and interest and tax expense are covered by cash flow from operations in addition to the annual positive cash flow from operating activities additional liquidity is readily available via the sale of shortterm investments and access to our 2000 million amended and restated credit agreement credit agreement that we entered into in june 2010 borrowings under the credit agreement are on a revolving basis and can be used to make acquisitions for working capital and for other general corporate purposes we had no outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement as of december 31 2010 the credit agreement expires on june 21 2014

the continuing slow economic growth in developed nations may adversely affect our future results of operations demand for our products and services could change more dramatically than in previous years based on activity and support levels from government universities hospitals and private industry including diagnostic laboratories the need for certain sovereign nations with large annual deficits to curtail spending could lead to slower growth of or even a decline in our business sovereign nations either delaying payment for goods and services or renegotiating their debts could impact our liquidity

at december 31 2010 we had 10252 million in cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments taking into consideration the cash needed to redeem our 750 senior subordinated notes in january 2011 we had available 7906 million in cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments under domestic and international lines of credit we had 2511 million available for borrowing as of december 31 2010 of which 139 million is reserved for standby letters of credit issued by our banks to guarantee our obligations to various companies management believes that this availability together with cash flow from operations will be adequate to meet our current objectives for operations research and development capital additions for manufacturing and distribution plant and equipment information technology systems and future acquisitions

the instability in credit markets along with inadequate capitalization in some parts of the financial services industry could impact both our ability and our customer’s ability to access the necessary capital for acquisition equipment and technology modernization and the financing of inventory and receivables without this crucial intermediary function manufacturers and end users may have to renegotiate existing arrangements reduce activity levels or seek other business partners

cash flow from operations 

net cash provided by operations was 2259 million 3251 million and 1914 million in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively the net decrease between 2010 and 2009 of 992 million primarily represented an increase in cash paid to suppliers including royalty payments covering multiple years and payments to settle intellectual property disputes higher payments on income taxes and higher interest payments primarily from the call premium and the redemption of the 2000 million of 6125 senior subordinated notes in december 2010 and the interest associated with the 300 million of 80 senior subordinated notes due in 2016 that were issued in may 2009 partially offsetting this decrease was an increase in cash received from customers compared to 2009 however cash received from customers was at a slower rate than expected in 2010 due to a slowdown in cash collections as many governments especially in europe address the need for deficit reductions and sovereign borrowings we continue to stress cash flow as a global companywide goal

the net change between 2009 and 2008 of 1337 million represented a 1219 million improvement in the net change in cash received from customers and cash paid to suppliers the largest item that contributed to the increase in cash flows was primarily due to a decrease in inventory levels which provided approximately 36 million of cash inflows in 2009 the expiration of some patents and slower payment patterns reduced royalty payments moderation in the growth of headcount and the reduction in other sga costs all contributed to an improved cash flow additionally we experienced a reduction in taxes paid of 114 million

we regularly review the allowance for uncollectible receivables and believe net accounts receivable are fully realizable we also routinely review inventory for the impact of obsolescence and changes in market prices caused by the introduction of new products technologies and in government reimbursement policies we expect the first quarter of 2011 cash flows from operations to be lower as biorad historically makes larger payments for royalties fourth quarter sales commissions to third parties and employee annual bonuses during this period

cash flow from investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities including capital expenditures was 2165 million 1760 million and 1461 million in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively capital expenditures in 2010 totaled 873 million compared to 668 million and 848 million in 2009 and 2008 respectively capital expenditures represent the addition and replacement of production machinery and research equipment ongoing manufacturing and facility additions for expansions regulatory and environmental compliance and leasehold improvements also included in capital expenditures were investments in business systems and data communication upgrades and

enhancements we anticipate accelerating expenditures in future periods to expand our ecommerce platform internationally and for implementation globally of a single instance erp platform for which we committed to purchase software in december 2010 the estimated global implementation cost could reach approximately 150 million and is estimated to take approximately five years to implement all periods included equipment placed with clinical diagnostics segment customers who then contract to purchase our reagents for use

on january 6 2010 we acquired certain diagnostic businesses of biotest ag for 45 million euros approximately 649 million in cash in september 2010 we acquired the remaining noncontrolling interests of diamed france sa for 102 million euros or approximately 129 million in cash in 2010 2009 and 2008 we acquired the remaining shares of diamed holding ag diamed for approximately 14 million 300 million and 336 million respectively in 2008 we also paid cash for the acquisition of two distributors for approximately 17 million all of these acquisitions are included in our clinical diagnostics segment we anticipate that we will purchase in 2011 the remaining noncontrolling interests in two diamed subsidiaries which we estimate will cost approximately 5 million

we continue to review other possible acquisitions to expand both our life science and clinical diagnostics segments including independent distributors of the diamed product line we routinely meet with the principals or brokers of the subject companies we are evaluating additional acquisitions on a preliminary basis it is not certain that any of these transactions will advance beyond the preliminary stages or be completed

cash flow from financing activities 

net cash provided by financing activities was 2287 million 2939 million and 63 million in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively cash provided in 2010 was primarily due to biorad issuing 4250 million principal amount of 4875 senior notes in december 2010 which yielded net proceeds of 4226 million at an effective rate of 4946 in december 2010 2043 million of the net proceeds were used to redeem our 2000 million 6125 senior subordinated notes including a call premium in january 2011 the remaining proceeds together with cash on hand were used to redeem our 2250 million 750 senior subordinated notes for 2346 million including a call premium this refinancing should lower our interest expense going forward

net cash provided by financing activities in 2009 was primarily due to biorad issuing 300 million of 8 senior subordinated notes in may 2009 which yielded net proceeds of 2948 million at an effective rate of 83 the net proceeds have been and will be used for working capital and general corporate purposes which may include acquisitions net cash provided by financing activities in 2008 principally reflected cash flow for the exercise of stock options and receipts from the employee stock purchase plan transactions partially offset by payments on longterm debt that represented the reduction of acquired diamed debt

the credit agreement that was entered into in june 2010 is secured by substantially all of our personal property assets the assets of our domestic subsidiaries and 65 of the capital stock of certain foreign subsidiaries it is guaranteed by all of our existing and future material domestic subsidiaries and expires in june 2014

the board of directors has authorized the repurchase of up to 18 million of biorad’s common stock over an indefinite period of time of which 33 million has yet to be repurchased the credit agreement and the indenture governing our 80 senior subordinated notes restrict our ability to repurchase our stock we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock during 2010 2009 or 2008

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements that have had or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

contractual obligations 

the following summarizes certain of our contractual obligations as of december 31 2010 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our cash flows in future periods in millions

 

recent financial accounting standards 

in january 2010 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued a standard to improve disclosures about fair value measurements specifically the standard requires entities to disclose the amounts of significant transfers between level 1 and level 2 of the fair value hierarchy and the reasons for these transfers the reasons for any transfers in or out of level 3 and information in the reconciliation of recurring level 3 measurements about purchases sales issuances and settlements on a gross basis the standard was effective for our interim period ended march 31 2010 except for the requirement to disclose information about purchases sales issuances and settlements in the reconciliation of recurring level 3 measurements on a gross basis those disclosures will be effective for our interim period ending march 31 2011 this standard did not effect nor is expected to effect our consolidated financial statements

item 7a quantitive and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

financial risk management 

the main goal of biorad’s financial risk management program is to reduce the variance in expected cash flows arising from unexpected foreign exchange rate and interest rate changes financial exposures are managed through operational means and by using various financial instruments including cash and liquid resources borrowings and forward and spot foreign exchange contracts no derivative financial instruments are entered into for the purpose of trading or speculation company policy requires that all derivative positions are undertaken to manage the risks arising from underlying business activities these derivative transactions do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment per general standards for derivatives and hedging derivative instruments used in these transactions are valued at fair value and changes in fair value are included in reported earnings

foreign exchange risk we operate and conduct business in many countries and are exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates we face transactional currency exposures that arise when we enter into transactions denominated in currencies other than us dollars additionally our consolidated net equity is impacted by the conversion of the net assets of our international subsidiaries for which the functional currency is not the us dollar

foreign currency exposures are managed on a centralized basis this allows for the netting of natural offsets and lowers transaction costs and net exposures where possible we seek to manage our foreign exchange risk in part through operational means including matching samecurrency revenues to same currency costs and samecurrency assets to samecurrency liabilities moreover weakening in one currency can often be offset by strengthening in another currency foreign exchange risk is also managed through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts positions are primarily in euro swiss franc british sterling singapore dollar and japanese yen the majority of forward contracts are for periods of 90 days or less we record the change in value of our foreign currency receivables and payables as a foreign exchange gain loss on our consolidated statements of income along with the change in fair market value of the forward exchange contract used as an economic hedge of those assets or liabilities

our forward contract holdings at yearend were analyzed to determine their sensitivity to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates all other variables were held constant market risk associated with derivative holdings is the potential change in fair value of derivative positions arising from an adverse movement in foreign exchange rates a decline of 10 on quoted foreign exchange rates would result in an approximate netpresentvalue loss of 49 million on our derivative position this impact of a change in exchange rates excludes the offset derived from the change in value of the underlying assets and liabilities which could reduce the adverse effect significantly

interest rate risk of debt instruments biorad centrally manages the shortterm cash surpluses and shortfalls of its subsidiaries our holdings of variable rate debt instruments at yearend were analyzed to determine their sensitivity to movements in interest rates due to the relatively small amount of shortterm variable rate debt we have outstanding there would not be a material impact to earnings or cash flows if interest rates moved adversely by 10 our longterm debt consists primarily of fixedrate instruments and is thus insulated from interest rate changes as of december 31 2010 the overall interest rate risk associated with our debt was not significant

 item 9a controls and procedures 

a

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

as of the end of the period covered by this report we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures based on that evaluation our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer concluded that although our disclosure controls and procedures were generally effective in timely alerting them to material information relating to us and our consolidated subsidiaries required to be disclosed in the reports we file and submit under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the exchange act they were not effective as disclosed below

the conclusion that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective relates in part to the results to date of our audit committee’s investigation with the assistance of independent special counsel of our compliance with the united states foreign corrupt practices act fcpa based on that investigation we have determined that our previous lack of a comprehensive fcpa compliance policy and training program and other inadequate entitylevel controls as discussed below led us to fail to identify fcpa compliance issues that were presented 

we have commenced the initial implementation of changes in our disclosure controls and procedures to provide greater assurance of future compliance with the requirements of the fcpa and to ensure that potential fcpa issues are appropriately identified reported and evaluated in the future these initial remediation efforts include

 

management’s annual report on and changes in internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in rule 13a15f under the exchange act our internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the preparation and fair presentation of our financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles an internal control system over financial reporting has inherent limitations and may not prevent or detect misstatements therefore even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation 

our management has used the framework set forth in the report entitled “internal control – integrated framework” published by the committee of sponsoring organizations coso of the treadway commission to evaluate the effectiveness of biorad’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2010 

based on that evaluation and assessment our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of december 31 2010 to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america to the extent and for the reasons set forth below our management reviewed the results of its evaluation and assessment with our audit committee 

in connection with our audit committee’s investigation of our compliance with the fcpa discussed above our management identified three significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2010 that when considered and taken together constitute a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2010 a significant deficiency is defined as a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting that is less severe than a material weakness yet important enough to merit attention by those responsible for oversight of our financial reporting a material weakness is defined as a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis

our conclusion that we have a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2010 is not based on quantified misstatements in our historical financial statements or our financial statements as of and for our fiscal year ended december 31 2010 but instead on the risk that we may be unable to prevent or detect on a timely basis potential material errors in our future financial statements we do not presently anticipate that the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2010 will have any material effect on our previously reported financial results or our financial results for our fiscal year ended december 31 2010

the three significant deficiencies that we identified in our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2010 are as follows

inadequate entitylevel controls  as of december 31 2010 we identified a number of entitylevel control deficiencies that when considered and taken together constitute a significant deficiency in our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2010 these entitylevel control deficiencies relate both to the design and to the operation of our internal controls and include

 

 

inadequate expenditure processes at certain of our international subsidiaries  as of december 31 2010 we identified a number of control deficiencies relating to our expenditure processes at certain of our international subsidiaries that when considered and taken together constitute a significant deficiency in our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2010 these control deficiencies relate both to the design and to the operation of our internal controls and include our lack of compliance with our existing management guidelines for contract and expenditure authorization and with our code of business ethics and conduct and our inability to produce documentary evidence to support certain contractual obligations

inadequate revenue and accounts receivable processes at certain of our international subsidiaries  as of december 31 2010 we identified a number of control deficiencies relating to our revenue and accounts receivable process at certain of our international subsidiaries that when considered and taken together constitute a significant deficiency in our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2010 these control deficiencies relate both to the design and to the operation of our internal controls and include our inability in certain instances to produce documentary evidence of effective operation of internal controls relating to contract management our lack of evidence regarding credit note authorizations inadequate control over changes to master customer files and our lack of compliance with reagent rental contracts and sales cutoff

in addition to our fcparelated remediation efforts described above under “disclosure controls and procedures” we have commenced the initiation of a number of actions to attempt to remediate the foregoing significant deficiencies and the resulting material weakness including 

 

we are also in the process of evaluating and expect to initiate additional actions to attempt to remediate these significant deficiencies and the resulting material weakness including developing and implementing additional policies further strengthening our disclosure processes and potentially increasing the resources that we devote to our internal compliance and audit functions

we cannot assure you that we will be able to remediate these significant deficiencies and the resulting material weakness or that additional significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting will not be identified in the future any failure to maintain or implement new or improved internal controls or any difficulties that we may encounter in their maintenance or implementation could result in additional significant deficiencies or material weaknesses result in material misstatements in our financial statements and cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations which in turn could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline

other than the changes discussed above we identified no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our fiscal quarter ended december 31 2010 that have materially affected or that are reasonably likely materially to affect our internal control over financial reporting

ernst  young llp an independent registered public accounting firm has audited the consolidated financial statements of biorad laboratories inc for the year ended december 31 2010 and 2009 and has issued an adverse attestation report on the effectiveness of biorad’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2010 as stated in their report

report of independent registered public accounting firm 

the board of directors and shareholders of biorad laboratories inc

we have audited biorad laboratories inc’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2010 based on criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the coso criteria biorad laboratories inc’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying management’s report on internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate

a material weakness is a deficiency or combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis the following material weakness has been identified and included in management’s assessment management has identified three significant deficiencies related to entity level controls and the expenditure and revenue processes at certain of the company’s international subsidiaries that when considered and taken together represent a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting

we also have audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the consolidated balance sheets of biorad laboratories inc as of december 31 2010 and 2009 and the related consolidated statements of income changes in stockholders equity and comprehensive income and cash flows for the years then ended this material weakness was considered in determining the nature timing and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the 2010 consolidated financial statements and this report does not affect our report dated february 28 2011 which expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements 

in our opinion because of the effect of the material weakness described above on the achievement of the objectives of the control criteria biorad laboratories inc has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2010 based on the coso criteria

general

founded in 1952 and incorporated in 1957 biorad laboratories inc referred to in this report as “biorad” “we” “us” and “our” was initially engaged in the development and produc­tion of specialty chemicals used in biochemical pharmaceutical and other life science research applications in 1967 we entered the field of clinical diagnostics with the development of our first test kit based on separation techniques and materials developed for life science research we expanded into the field of analytical and measuring instrument systems through internal research and development efforts and acquisitions in the late 1970s and 1980s in 1999 we acquired the stock of pasteur sanofi diagnostics and the rights to certain ancillary assets this strengthened our position in the hiv and infectious disease testing market in 2000 and 2004 we divested our semiconductor optoelectronic metrology and confocal microscopy product lines during 2007 we acquired diamed holding ag enhancing our position in the immunohematology market

as we broadened our product lines we also expanded our geographical market we have distribution channels in over thirty countries outside the united states through subsidiaries whose focus is customer service and product distribution

biorad manufactures and supplies the life science research healthcare analytical chemistry and other markets with a broad range of products and systems used to separate complex chemical and biological materials and to identify analyze and purify their components

description of business 

business segments 

today biorad operates in two industry segments designated as life science and clinical diagnostics both segments operate worldwide for a description of business and financial information on industry and geographic segments see note 13 on pages 62 through 65 of item 8

life science segment

life science is the study of the characteristics behavior and structure of living organisms and their component systems life science researchers use a variety of products and systems including reagents instruments software and apparatus to advance the study of life processes drug discovery biotechnology and food pathogen testing primarily within a laboratory setting

we focus on selected segments of the life science market which we estimate to be approximately 5 billion the primary technological applications that we supply to these segments consist of electrophoresis image analysis molecular detection chromatography gene transfer sample preparation and amplification the primary endusers in our sectors of the market are universities and medical schools industrial research organizations government agencies pharmaceutical manufacturers biotechnology researchers and food testing laboratories

clinical diagnostics segment

we estimate the worldwide clinical diagnostics segment in which we participate to be approximately 10 billion the market encompasses a broad array of technologies incorporated into a variety of products used to detect identify monitor and quantify substances in patient and donor blood or other bodily fluids and tissues the vast majority of these tests are performed in vitro outside the body the information generated by these tests helps physicians diagnose disease and guide patient therapy and treatment all of which helps improve patient care it is estimated that diagnostic testing influences 70 or more of patient care decisions made by doctors while comprising less than two percent of total healthcare costs

the market is split into several sub segments consisting of clinical chemistry immunoassay microbiology hematology molecular coagulation blood banking and blood typing biorad has significant positions in blood virus testing blood banking and immunoassay immunohematology blood typing hemoglobin a1c testing for diabetes monitoring clinical chemistry and immunoassay autoimmune disease testing immunoassay and quality control crossing all sub segments

consumers of clinical diagnostic products are hospital laboratories reference laboratories physician office laboratories government agencies and diagnostic manufacturers purchasing decisions are normally based on improving the healthcare of patients improving laboratory efficiency and reducing overall costs biorads products and services generally meet or exceed these criteria leading to strong customer loyalty and recurring revenue exceeding 70 of our total clinical diagnostics sales

raw materials and components 

we utilize a wide variety of chemicals biological materials electronic components machined metal parts optical parts minicomputers and peripheral devices most of these materials and components are available from numerous sources and we have not experienced difficulty in securing adequate supplies

patents and trademarks 

we own numerous us and international patents and patent licenses we believe however that our ability to develop and manufacture our products depends primarily on our knowledge technology and special skills we pay royalties on the sales of certain products under several patent license agreements we view these patents and license agreements as valuable assets

seasonal operations and backlog 

our business is not inherently seasonal however the european custom of concentrating vacation during the summer months usually tempers third quarter sales volume and operating income

for the most part we operate in markets characterized by short lead times and the absence of significant backlogs management has concluded that backlog information is not material to our business as a whole

sales and marketing 

each of biorads segments maintains a sales force to sell its products on a direct basis each sales force is technically trained in the disciplines associated with its products sales are also generated through direct mail advertising exhibits at trade shows and technical meetings telemarketing ecommerce and by extensive advertising in technical and trade publications sales and marketing efforts are augmented by technical service departments that assist customers in effective product utilization and in new product applications we also produce and distribute technical literature and hold seminars for customers on the use of our products

our customer base is broad and diversified in 2009 no single customer accounted for more than two percent of our total net sales our sales are affected by certain external factors for example a number of our customers particularly in the life science segment are substantially dependent on government grants and research contracts for their funding a significant reduction of government funding would have a detrimental effect on the results of this segment

most of our international sales are generated by our whollyowned subsidiaries and their branch offices certain of these subsidiaries also have manufacturing facilities biorad’s international operations are subject to certain risks common to foreign operations in general such as changes in governmental regulations import restrictions and foreign exchange fluctuations however our international operations are principally in developed nations which we regard as presenting no significantly greater risks to our operations than are present in the united states

competition 

the markets served by our product groups are highly competitive our competitors range in size from startups to large multinational corporations with significant resources and reach reliable independent information on sales and market share of products produced by our competitors is not generally available we believe however based on our own estimates no one company is so dominant that it prevents other companies including biorad from competing effectively we compete mainly in market segments where our products and technology offer customers specific advantages over the competition we tend to avoid head to head competition against entrenched competitors with metoo products

because of the breadth of its product lines the life science segment does not face the same competitors for all of its products competitors in this market include ge biosciences life technologies millipore and thermo fisher scientific we compete primarily based on meeting performance specifications

major competitors in clinical diagnostics include roche abbott laboratories diagnostic division siemens medical diagnostics solutions formerly dadebehring diagnostics products corporation and bayer diagnostics beckman coulter bectondickinson biomérieux johnson  johnson ortho clinical diagnostics tosoh immucor cepheid and diasorin

product research and development 

we conduct extensive product research and development activities in all areas of our business employing approximately 780 people worldwide in these activities research and development have played a major role in biorads growth and are expected to continue to do so in the future our research teams are continuously developing new products and new applications for existing products in our development and testing of new products and applications we consult with scientific and medical professionals at universities hospitals and medical schools and in the industry excluding purchased inprocess research and development expense we spent approximately 1636 million 1595 million and 1405 million on research and development activities during the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively

regulatory matters 

the manufacturing marketing and labeling of certain of our products primarily diagnostic products are subject to regulation in the united states by the center for devices and radiological health of the united states food and drug administration fda and in other jurisdictions by state and foreign government authorities fda regulations require that some new products have premarketing approval by the fda and require certain products to be manufactured in accordance with “good manufacturing practices” to be extensively tested and to be properly labeled to disclose test results and performance claims and limitations

as a multinational manufacturer and distributor of sophisticated instrumentation equipment we must meet a wide array of electromagnetic compatibility and safety compliance requirements to satisfy regulations in the united states the european community and other jurisdictions these requirements relating to testing and trials product licensing pricing and reimbursement vary widely among countries

our operations are subject to federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations that govern such activities as transportation of goods emissions to air and discharges to water as well as handling and disposal practices for solid hazardous and medical wastes in addition to environmental laws that regulate our operations we are also subject to environmental laws and regulations that create liabilities and cleanup responsibility for spills disposals or other releases of hazardous substances into the environment as a result of our operations or otherwise impacting real property that we own or operate the environmental laws and regulations could also subject us to claims by third parties for damages resulting from any spills disposals or releases resulting from our operations or at any of our properties 

employees 

at december 31 2009 biorad had approximately 6600 fulltime employees fewer than eight percent of biorads approximately 2675 us employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement which will expire on november 7 2012 many of biorads nonus fulltime employees especially in france are covered by collective bargaining agreements we consider our employee relations in general to be good

 item 1a risk factors 

tableend 

the following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating our business and the forwardlooking information contained in this annual report on form 10k we believe that any of the following risks could have a material affect on our business operations industry financial position or our future financial performance while we believe that we have identified and discussed below the key risk factors affecting our business there may be additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known or that are not currently believed to be significant that may adversely affect our business operations industry financial position and financial performance in the future

 

recent global market and economic conditions have been unprecedented and challenging with tighter credit conditions slower growth and recession in most major economies during 2009 although signs of recovery may exist there are continued concerns about the systemic impact of inflation the availability and cost of credit a declining real estate market and geopolitical issues that contribute to increased market volatility and uncertain expectations for the global economy these conditions combined with declining business activity levels and consumer confidence increased unemployment and volatile oil prices contributed to unprecedented levels of volatility in the capital markets during 2009 any additional continued or recurring disruptions in the capital and credit markets may adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition

as a result of these market conditions the cost and availability of credit has been and may continue to be adversely affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads concern about the stability of the markets generally and the strength of counterparties specifically has led many lenders and institutional investors to reduce and in some cases cease to provide credit to businesses and consumers these factors have led to a decrease in spending by businesses and consumers alike our customers and vendors may experience cash flow concerns and as a result customers may modify delay or cancel plans to purchase our products and vendors may increase their prices reduce their output or change terms of sales additionally if customers’ or vendors’ operating and financial performance deteriorates or if they are unable to make scheduled payments or obtain credit customers may not be able to pay or may delay payment of amounts owed to us

vendors may restrict credit or impose less favorable payment terms any inability of current andor potential customers to pay us for our products or any demands by vendors for accelerated payment terms may adversely affect our earnings and cash flow additionally strengthening of the us dollar associated with the global financial crisis may adversely affect the results of our international operations when those results are translated into us dollars furthermore the disruption in the credit markets could impede our access to capital especially if we are unable to maintain our current credit ratings should we have limited access to additional financing sources when needed we may decide to defer capital expenditures or seek other higher cost sources of liquidity which may or may not be available to us on acceptable terms continued turbulence in the us and international markets and economies and prolonged declines in business and consumer spending may adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition and the liquidity and financial condition of our customers including our ability to refinance maturing liabilities and access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs

 

as part of our overall business strategy we pursue acquisitions of and investments in complementary companies products and technologies in order to be successful in these activities we must among other things 

 

the benefits of any acquisition may prove to be less than anticipated and may not outweigh the costs reported in our financial statements completing any potential future acquisition could cause significant diversion of our management’s time and resources if we acquire new companies products or technologies we may be required to assume contingent liabilities or record impairment charges for goodwill and other intangible assets over time we cannot assure you that we will successfully overcome these risks or any other problems we encounter in connection with any acquisitions and any such acquisitions could adversely affect our business financial position or operating results

 

the life science and clinical diagnostics markets are each highly competitive some of our competitors have greater financial resources than we do and are less leveraged than we are making them better equipped to license technologies and intellectual property from third parties or to fund research and development manufacturing and marketing efforts moreover competitive and regulatory conditions in many markets in which we operate restrict our ability to fully recover through price increases higher costs of acquired goods and services resulting from inflation and other drivers of cost increases our competitors can be expected to continue to improve the design and performance of their products and to introduce new products with competitive price and performance characteristics maintaining these advantages will require us to continue to invest in research and development sales and marketing and customer service and support we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient resources to continue to make such investments or that we will be successful in maintaining such advantages

 

a significant portion of our sales are made outside of the united states our foreign subsidiaries generated 68 of our net sales in the year ended december 31 2009 our international operations are subject to risks common to foreign operations such as general economic and market conditions in the countries in which we operate changes in governmental regulations political instability import restrictions and currency exchange rate risks we cannot assure you that shifts in currency exchange rates especially significant strengthening of the us dollar compared to the euro will not have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

 

our customers include universities clinical diagnostics laboratories government agencies hospitals and pharmaceutical biotechnology and chemical companies the capital spending programs of these institutions and companies have a significant effect on the demand for our products such policies are based on a wide variety of factors including the resources available to make such purchases the availability of funding from grants by governments or government agencies the spending priorities among various types of equipment and the policies regarding capital expenditures during industry downturns or recessionary periods if government funding to our customers were to decrease or if our customers were to decrease or reallocate their budgets in a manner adverse to us our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

healthcare reform and the growth of managed care organizations have been and continue to be significant factors in the clinical diagnostics market the trend towards managed care together with efforts to reform the healthcare delivery system in the united states and europe has resulted in increased pressure on healthcare providers and other participants in the healthcare industry to reduce costs consolidation among healthcare providers has resulted in fewer more powerful groups whose purchasing power gives them cost containment leverage these competitive forces place constraints on the levels of overall pricing and thus could have a material adverse effect on our profit margins for products we sell in clinical diagnostics markets to the extent that the healthcare industry seeks to address the need to contain costs by limiting the number of clinical tests being performed our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected if these changes in the healthcare markets in the united states and europe continue we could be forced to alter our approach in selling marketing distributing and servicing our products 

 

our future success depends on our ability to continue to improve our product offerings and develop and introduce new product lines and extensions that integrate new technological advances if we are unable to integrate technological advances into our product offerings or to design develop manufacture and market new product lines and extensions successfully and in a timely manner our operating results will be adversely affected we cannot assure you that our product and process development efforts will be successful or that new products we introduce will achieve market acceptance 

 

our information technology it systems are an integral part of our business and a serious disruption of our it systems could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations we depend on our it systems to process orders manage inventory and collect accounts receivable our it systems also allow us to efficiently purchase products from our suppliers and ship products to our customers on a timely basis maintain costeffective operations and provide customer service we cannot assure you that our contingency plans will allow us to operate at our current level of efficiency 

our ability to implement our business plan in a rapidly evolving market requires effective planning reporting and analytical processes we expect that we will need to continue to improve and further integrate our it systems reporting systems and operating procedures by training and educating our employees with respect to these improvements and integrations on an ongoing basis in order to effectively run our business if we fail to successfully manage and integrate our it systems reporting systems and operating procedures it could adversely affect our business or operating results 

 

we rely on a combination of copyright trade secret patent and trademark laws and thirdparty nondisclosure agreements to protect our intellectual property rights and products however we cannot assure you that our intellectual property rights will not be challenged invalidated circumvented or rendered unenforceable or that meaningful protection or adequate remedies will be available to us for instance it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy our intellectual property to reverse engineer or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary or to develop equivalent technologies independently additionally third parties may assert patent copyright and other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to us if we are unable to license or otherwise access protected technology used in our products or if we lose our rights under any existing licenses we could be prohibited from manufacturing and marketing such products we may find it necessary to enforce our patents or other intellectual property rights or to defend ourselves against claimed infringement of the rights of others through litigation which could result in substantial costs to us and divert our resources we also could incur substantial costs to redesign our products to defend any legal action taken against us or to pay damages to an infringed party the foregoing matters could adversely impact our business 

 

some of our products primarily diagnostic products production processes and marketing are subject to federal state local and foreign regulation including the fda and its foreign counterparts we are also subject to government regulation of the use and handling of a number of materials and controlled substances failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in substantial liability to us suspension or cessation of our operations restrictions on our ability to expand at our present locations or require us to make significant capital expenditures or incur other significant expenses 

 

our operations are subject to federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations that govern such activities as transportation of goods emissions to air and discharges to water as well as handling and disposal practices for solid hazardous and medical wastes in addition to environmental laws that regulate our operations we are also subject to environmental laws and regulations that create liability and cleanup responsibility for spills disposals or other releases of hazardous substances into the environment as a result of our operations or otherwise impacting real property that we own or operate the environmental laws and regulations also subject us to claims by third parties for damages resulting from any spills disposals or releases resulting from our operations or at any of our properties 

we may in the future incur capital and operating costs to comply with currently existing laws and regulations and possible new statutory enactments and these expenditures may be significant we have incurred and may in the future incur fines related to environmental matters and liability for costs or damages related to spills or other releases of hazardous substances into the environment at sites where we have operated or at offsite locations where we have sent hazardous substances for disposal we can provide no assurance however that such matters or any future obligations to comply with environmental laws and regulations will not have a material impact on our operations or financial condition

 

our products and services are highly technical in nature in general only highly qualified and trained scientists have the necessary skills to develop and market our products and provide our services in addition some of our manufacturing positions are highly technical we face intense competition for these professionals from our competitors customers marketing partners and other companies throughout our industry we generally do not enter into employment agreements requiring these employees to continue in our employment for any period of time any failure on our part to hire train and retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel could substantially damage our business additionally if we were to lose a sufficient number of our research and development scientists and were unable to replace them or satisfy our needs for research and development through outsourcing it could adversely affect our business 

 

we have two classes of voting stock class a common stock and class b common stock with a few exceptions holders of class a and class b common stock vote as a single class when voting as a single class each share of class a common stock is entitled to onetenth of a vote while each share of class b common stock has one vote in the election or removal of directors the classes vote separately and the holders of class a common stock are entitled to elect 25 of the board of directors with holders of class b common stock electing the remaining directors 

as of february 16 2010 the schwartz family collectively held approximately 16 of our class a common stock and 90 of our class b common stock as a result the schwartz family is able to elect a majority of the directors effect fundamental changes in our direction and control matters affecting us including the allocation of business opportunities that may be suitable for our company in addition this concentration of ownership and voting power may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company 

the schwartz family may exercise its control over us according to interests that are different from other investors’ or debtors’ interests

 

the design and effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting may not prevent all errors misstatements or misrepresentations we cannot assure you that our disclosure controls and procedures over internal control of financial reporting will be effective in accomplishing all control objectives all of the time deficiencies particularly a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting which may occur in the future could result in misstatements of our results of operations restatements of our financial statements a decline in our stock price or otherwise materially adversely affect our business reputation results of operation financial condition or liquidity

  

we have significant manufacturing and distribution facilities particularly in the western united states france and switzerland in particular the western united states has experienced a number of earthquakes wildfires flooding landslides and other natural disasters in recent years the occurrences could damage or destroy our facilities which may result in interruptions to our business and losses that exceed our insurance coverage terrorist attacks such as those that occurred on september 11 2001 have contributed to economic instability in the united states and further acts of terrorism bioterrorism violence or war could affect the markets in which we operate our business operations our expectations and other forwardlooking statements contained or incorporated in this document any of these events could cause a decrease in our revenue earnings and cash flows

we may incur losses in future periods due to writedowns in the value of financial instruments 

we have positions in a variety of financial instruments including asset backed securities and other similar instruments financial markets are quite volatile and the markets for these securities can be illiquid the value of these securities will continue to be impacted by external market factors including default rates changes in the value of the underlying property such as residential or commercial real estate rating agency actions the prices at which observable market transactions occur and the financial strength of various entities such as financial guarantors who provide insurance for the securities should we need to convert these positions to cash we may not be able to sell these instruments without significant losses due to current debtor financial conditions or other market considerations 

 

as of december 31 2009 we and our subsidiaries have approximately 7426 million of outstanding indebtedness in addition the indenture governing our notes permits us to incur additional debt provided we comply with the limitation on the incurrence of additional indebtedness and disqualified capital stock covenants contained in the indenture 

the following chart shows certain important credit statistics

 

the incurrence of substantial amounts of debt may have important consequences for instance it could 

 

our ability to satisfy our obligations and to reduce our total debt depends on our future operating performance and on economic financial competitive and other factors many of which are beyond our control our business may not generate sufficient cash flow and future financings may not be available to provide sufficient net proceeds to meet these obligations or to successfully execute our business strategy

the indenture governing our notes and the terms of other debt instruments including without limitation our credit facilities and other agreements we may enter in the future contain or will contain covenants imposing significant restrictions on our business these restrictions may affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise these covenants place restrictions on our ability to among other things 

 

our existing credit facility also requires that we meet certain financial tests and maintain certain financial ratios including a maximum consolidated leverage ratio test minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio test and a minimum net worth test 

our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control including prevailing economic financial and industry conditions the breach of any of these restrictions could result in a default an event of default under our debt agreements would permit some of our lenders to declare all amounts borrowed from them to be due and payable together with accrued and unpaid interest if we were unable to repay debt to our senior secured lenders these lenders could proceed against the collateral securing that debt the collateral is substantially all of our personal property assets the assets of our domestic subsidiaries and 65 of the capital stock of certain foreign subsidiaries in addition acceleration of our other indebtedness may cause us to be unable to make interest payments on our notes and repay the principal amount of the notes or may cause the future subsidiary guarantors if any to be unable to make payments under the guarantees

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

this discussion should be read in conjunction with the information contained in our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes which are an integral part of the statements

other than statements of historical fact statements made in this annual report include forwardlooking statements such as statements with respect to our future financial performance operating results plans and objectives that involve risk and uncertainties forwardlooking statements generally can be identified by the use of forwardlooking terminology such as “believe” “expect” “may” “will” “intend” “estimate” “continue” or similar expressions or the negative of those terms or expressions such statements involve risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to vary materially from those expressed in or indicated by the forwardlooking statements we have based these forwardlooking statements on our current expectations and projections about future events however actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated depending on a variety of risk factors including among other things changes in general domestic and worldwide economic conditions our ability to successfully develop and market new products our reliance on and access to necessary intellectual property our ability to successfully integrate any acquired business our substantial leverage and ability to service our debt competition in and government regulation of the industries in which we operate and the monetary policies of various countries we caution you not to place undue reliance on forwardlooking statements which reflect an analysis only and speak only as of the date hereof we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise except as required by federal securities law

overview  we are a multinational manufacturer and worldwide distributor of our own life science research and clinical diagnostics products our business is organized into two primary segments life science and clinical diagnostics with the mission to provide scientists with specialized tools needed for biological research and clinical diagnostics we sell more than 8000 products and services to a diverse client base comprised of scientific research healthcare education and government customers worldwide we manufacture and supply our customers with a range of reagents apparatus and equipment to separate complex chemical and biological materials and to identify analyze and purify components because our customers require standardization for their experiments and test results much of our revenues are recurring approximately 32 of our 2009 consolidated net sales are from the united states and approximately 68 are from international locations the international sales are largely denominated in local currencies such as euros swiss franc japanese yen and british sterling as a result our consolidated net sales expressed in dollars benefit when the us dollar weakens and suffer when the us dollar strengthens when the us dollar strengthens we benefit from lower cost of sales from our own international manufacturing sites as well as nonus suppliers and from lower international operating expenses

the market for reagents and apparatus remains good while growth rates have slowed due to both public and private grant funding being more measured the market for large capital equipment has slowed as many pharmaceutical and biotechnology customers delayed or reduced their capital spending biorad is generally less impacted by trends in capital spending as lower priced reagents and apparatus comprise more than 70 of product sales

the following shows gross profit and expense items as a percentage of net sales

 

we intend that the discussions of critical accounting policies and estimates and recent accounting pronouncements that follow will assist you in understanding how such principles estimates and accounting pronouncements affect our financial condition and results of operations as well as significant factors that caused changes in our financial condition and results of operations for the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the accompanying discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities and contingencies as of the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis we base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources however future events may cause us to change our assumptions and estimates which may require adjustment actual results could differ from these estimates we have determined that for the periods reported in this annual report on form 10k the following accounting policies and estimates are critical in understanding our financial condition and results of operations

accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing consolidated financial statements management is required to make estimates related to our income tax provision in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate this process involves estimating our current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within our consolidated balance sheets management then assesses the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent management believes that recovery is not likely a valuation allowance must be established to the extent management establishes a valuation allowance or increases this allowance in a period an increase to expense within the provision for income taxes in the consolidated statements of income may result

we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements on a particular tax position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than a 50 likelihood of being realized upon settlement the amount of unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted as appropriate for changes in facts and circumstances such as significant amendments to existing tax law new regulations or interpretations by the taxing authorities new information obtained during a tax examination or resolution of an examination we recognize both accrued interest and penalties where appropriate related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 

significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded in connection with the deferred tax assets we have recorded a valuation allowance of 379 million and 407 million as of december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize some of the deferred tax assets primarily consisting of certain foreign net operating losses carried forward the valuation allowance is based on management’s current estimates of taxable income for the jurisdictions in which we operate and the period over which the deferred tax assets will be recoverable in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or these estimates are adjusted in future periods an additional valuation allowance may need to be established which would increase the tax provision lowering income and impacting our financial position should realization of these previously reserved deferred tax assets occur the provision for income taxes may decrease raising income and positively impacting biorad’s financial position

valuation of goodwill and longlived assets goodwill represents the excess of the cost over the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses goodwill amounts are assigned to reporting units at the time of acquisition and are adjusted for subsequent significant transfers of business between reporting units we assess the impairment of goodwill annually in the fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable we perform the impairment tests of goodwill at our reporting unit level which is one level below our reporting segments the goodwill impairment test consists of a twostep process the first step of the goodwill impairment test used to identify potential impairment compares the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is not required the second step if required compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill the fair value of a reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the price paid to acquire the reporting unit if the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value an impairment charge is recognized in an amount equal to that excess

we use projected discounted cash flow models to determine the fair value of a reporting unit the discounted cash value projected for goodwill may be different from the fair value that would result from an actual transaction between a willing buyer and a willing seller projections such as discounted cash flow models are inherently uncertain and accordingly actual future cash flows may differ materially from projected cash flows management judgment is required in developing the assumptions for the discounted cash flow model these assumptions include revenue growth rates profit margins future capital expenditures working capital needs expected foreign currency rates discount rates and terminal values we estimate future cash flows using current and longterm high level strategic financial forecasts these forecasts take into account the current economic environment the discount rates used are compiled using independent sources current trends in similar businesses and other observable market data changes to these rates might result in material changes in the valuation and determination of the recoverability of goodwill for example an increase in the discount rate used to discount cash flows will decrease the computed fair value in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test we apply a 10 decrease to the fair value of each reporting unit

to validate the reasonableness of the reporting unit fair values we reconcile the aggregate fair values of the reporting units to the enterprise market capitalization including an implied control premium in performing the reconciliation we may depending on the volatility of the market value of our stock price use either the stock price on the valuation date or the average stock price over a range of dates around the valuation date we compare the implied control premium to premiums paid in observable recent transactions of comparable companies to determine if the fair values of the reporting units are reasonable

for purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment loss a longlived asset or assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities we assess the impairment of longlived assets including identifiable intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable factors that we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include

 

when management determines that the carrying value of longlived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment we test for any impairment based on a projected undiscounted cash flow method projected future operating results and cash flows of the asset or asset group are used to establish the fair value used in evaluating the carrying value of longlived and intangible assets we estimate the future cash flows of the longlived assets using current and longterm financial forecasts the carrying amount of a longlived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset if this is the case an impairment loss would be recognized the impairment loss recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value

in 2009 and 2008 our reviews indicated impairment charges of 38 million and 16 million respectively related to the developed technology intangible assets of certain product lines that were acquired in 2006 also in 2008 our review indicated an impairment charge of 272 million related to goodwill from a 1999 acquisition the goodwill impairment was caused primarily by the continuing decline in the bse bovine spongiform encephalopathy product line there were no impairment losses recorded in 2007

valuation of inventories we value inventory at the lower of the actual cost to purchase andor manufacture the inventory or the current estimated realizable value of the inventory we review inventory quantities on hand and reduce the cost basis of excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on an estimated forecast of product demand production requirements and the quality efficacy and potency of raw materials this review is done on a quarterly basis or if warranted by the circumstances more frequently in addition our industry is characterized by technological change frequent new product development and product obsolescence that could result in an increase in the amount of obsolete inventory quantities on hand our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate and if too high we may have overstated the carrying value of our inventory in the future if inventory is determined to be overvalued we would be required to write down the value of inventory to market and recognize such costs in our cost of goods sold at the time of such determination therefore although we make efforts to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand and perform procedures to safeguard overall inventory quality any significant unanticipated changes in demand technological developments regulations storage conditions or other environment factors affecting biological materials could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and reported results of operations

valuation of investments we regularly review our investments for factors that may indicate that a decline in the fair value of an investment below its carrying value is otherthantemporary some factors considered in evaluating whether or not a decline in fair value is otherthantemporary include our ability and intent to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for a recovery in value the duration and extent to which the fair value has been less than cost and the financial condition and prospects of the issuer such reviews are inherently uncertain in that the value of the investment may not fully recover or may decline further in future periods resulting in realized losses

warranty reserves we warrant certain equipment against defects in design materials and workmanship generally for a period of one year upon delivery and on acceptance of that equipment we establish as part of cost of goods sold a provision for the expected costs of such warranty repairs based on historical experience specific warranty terms and customer feedback a review is performed on a quarterly basis to assess the adequacy of our warranty reserve and it is adjusted if necessary the warranty reserve is based on actual experience and expected future costs to be incurred should realized costs be higher than expected costs cost of goods sold would be lower in the period of estimation and higher when realized

allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the collectibility of our customer accounts the amount of the allowance is determined by analyzing known uncollectible accounts the age of our receivables economic conditions in the customers’ country or industry historical losses and our customers’ general creditworthiness amounts later determined and specifically identified to be uncollectible are charged or written off against this allowance uncertainty in the current economic environment if prolonged could result in greater amounts becoming uncollectible in the future should the estimates of losses be higher than the actual uncollectible accounts we would report lower profitability when the estimates are made and higher profitability when the receivable is collected

litigation accruals we record as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets estimated amounts for claims that are probable and can be reasonably estimated the likelihood of a material change in these estimated reserves is dependent on the possible outcome of settlement negotiations regulatory or judicial review and the development of facts and circumstances in extended litigation which could change claims or assessments when both the amount and range of loss on some outstanding litigation is uncertain we disclose in the footnotes of the financial statements when we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of a material liability that could result from unfavorable outcomes in litigation as events occur we will assess the potential liability related to our pending litigation and revise our estimates such revisions could materially impact our results of operations

corporate results  sales gross margins and expenses 

our net sales increased by 11 in 2009 to 17842 million as compared to 2008 excluding the impact of foreign currency 2009 sales increased by approximately 55 compared to 2008 currency neutral sales growth was generated primarily in the regions of asia pacific the united states and developing or emerging markets of eastern europe and latin america also contributing to sales growth are diamed holding ag diamed distributors acquired in late 2008 and early 2009

the life science segment sales decreased 19 in 2009 as compared to 2008 or a 08 increase on a currency neutral basis the decline in sales of bse bovine spongiform encephalopathy products continued in 2009 as both product prices eroded and governmentmandated tests declined excluding the impact of the bse product line the life science segment grew by 13 in 2009 as compared to 2008 product groups showing growth include realtime pcr instruments and reagents the proteon tm protein interaction analysis system and the biotechnology explorer tm program sales growth in the life science segment was primarily in asia pacific latin america and the us while european sales represented the majority of declining sales

the clinical diagnostics segment achieved sales growth of 30 in 2009 as compared to 2008 excluding the impact of foreign currency sales increased 85 compared to 2008 most clinical diagnostics major products showed sales growth such as in bioplex 2200 systems quality controls and blood virus products there was a decline in sales of contract manufacturing as some of these contracts were not renewed on a regional basis currency neutral sales growth was primarily provided by asia pacific the united states and emerging markets including latin america partially offset by sales declines in europe

our net sales increased by 208 in 2008 to 17644 million as compared to 2007 this included sales related to the fourth quarter 2007 acquisition of diamed the 2008 impact of foreign exchange translation contributed to sales growth by approximately three percent the incremental sales from the additional nine months in 2008 attributable to diamed accounted for approximately 13 of the annual growth 

the life science segment achieved sales growth of 46 in 2008 as compared to 2007 aided by the impact of foreign exchange translation of 32 excluding the decline of the bse product line this segment grew by 66 increased sales were the result of growth in pcr chemicals and instruments the bioplex suspension array system and protean instruments sales in the united states emerging markets and asia pacific were the drivers of sales growth

the clinical diagnostics segment achieved sales growth of 330 in 2008 as compared to 2007 which includes sales growth from our acquisition of diamed the incremental sales from the additional nine months of diamed operations provided 228 of our clinical diagnostics sales growth the impact of foreign exchange on clinical diagnostics segment sales growth added approximately 29 to total segment sales the clinical diagnostics segment experienced growth across a wide range of its product offerings with the bioplex 2200 system quality controls and clinical microbiology having the strongest growth geographically the drivers of sales growth excluding the diamed acquisition were in the united states europe and asia pacific

consolidated gross margins were 560 for 2009 compared to 546 for 2008 life science segment gross margins improved in 2009 compared to 2008 by 01 the improvement was the result of better manufacturing overhead absorption from a reduction in costs the move of new products to more cost efficient offshore manufacturing and sales mix favoring higher margin reagents rather than instruments with typically lower margin clinical diagnostics segment gross margins improved by approximately 22 in 2009 compared to 2008 improvements included lower royalty payments paid to licensors as a result of the expiration of patents in blood virus and immunohematology products increased margin from the acquisition of diamed distributors and the reduction of the impact of diamed preacquisition inventory subject to purchase accounting rules additionally the bioplex 2200 margins have improved from greater placements and higher test volume

the 2008 consolidated gross margin of 546 represented an increase of 04 from 2007 life science segment gross margins increased by 20 to 541 as a result of decreasing factory costs in some overhead areas improved production planning reduced quality defects and improved sales mix the clinical diagnostics segment gross margins decreased by 08 in 2008 as compared to 2007 as a result of including an additional nine months of diamed operations the diamed gross margins included the amortization of manufacturing related purchased intangibles and the effect of higher inventory values on workinprocess inventory in compliance with purchase accounting requirements

consolidated selling general and administrative expense sga represented 337 of net sales for 2009 compared to 335 of net sales in 2008 growth in absolute sga spending was proportional to sales the clinical diagnostics segment grew sga at a slightly lower rate than the growth in its sales while the life science segment’s reduced rate of spending in sga was larger than the decline in its sales absolute dollar increases in sga were primarily in employeerelated expenses and purchased intangibles amortization partially offset by lower travel costs and professional services

consolidated sga for 2008 was 335 of net sales compared to 348 in 2007 the decline from 2007 was mainly attributable to the inclusion of diamed which had an overall lower percentage of sga relative to its net sales growth in absolute sga spending was proportional to sales with life science segment’s sga growing faster than sales growth while the clinical diagnostics segment grew at a slightly lower rate excluding the impact of diamed approximately half of the increase in sga was related to personnel costs including compensation and travel the remaining increases were attributable to agent commissions technology infrastructure cost professional services and provision for bad debts

product research and development expense was 1636 million in 2009 or 92 of sales compared to 90 of sales in 2008 life science segment development efforts are directed towards genomics proteomics and process chromatography applications clinical diagnostics segment development efforts are focused on expanded tests for the bioplex 2200 testing platform as well as other enhancements to existing automation and reagents used for immunohematology clinical microbiology and blood virus diagnostic tests and additional quality control products in absolute dollars the increase was in the clinical diagnostic segment partially offset by a decrease in the life science segment

product research and development expense in 2008 declined to 90 of net sales as compared to 96 of net sales in 2007 areas of development for the life science segment were amplification proteomics protein function food safety and process chromatography clinical diagnostics segment research and development were focused on additional assays for the bioplex 2200 testing platform as well as investments in automation for the diamed line of blood typing instruments and reagents product line extensions in diabetes infectious disease quality control and software offerings in absolute dollars the increase in rd was almost exclusively in the clinical diagnostics segment

corporate results – nonoperating 

interest expense in 2009 increased 464 to 470 million when compared to 2008 an additional 300 million of 80 senior subordinated notes were issued in may 2009 increasing our indebtedness to 7426 million at december 31 2009 and increasing our interest expense our additional principal debt obligations are the 2003 and 2004 senior subordinated notes totaling 4250 million which carry fixed rates of interest of 75 and 6125 and are not due until august 2013 and december 2014 respectively

interest expense increased by 05 million in 2008 as compared to 2007 the increase reflected higher average borrowings on local lines of credit and increased interest on capital leases

foreign currency exchange gains and losses consist of foreign currency transaction gains and losses on intercompany net receivables and payables and the change in fair value of our forward foreign exchange contracts used to manage our foreign currency exchange risk foreign currency exchange losses for 2009 2008 and 2007 were 50 million 76 million and 26 million respectively the 2009 exchange loss was attributable to greater market volatility higher costs to hedge and the result of the estimating process inherent in the timing of shipments and payments of intercompany debt the 2008 loss reflected a number of unhedged european based intercompany loans denominated in euros british sterling and swiss francs which arose as part of our acquisitions in december 2008 the significant volatility in december 2008 resulted in an approximate 3 million noncash loss on these accounts additionally we recorded a 2008 loss of 16 million on unhedged intercompany payables for our brazilian subsidiaries which we have not historically hedged due to the high cost all years are affected by the economic hedging program we employ to hedge our intercompany receivables and payables

other income and expense net for 2009 includes investment and dividend income generally interest income on our cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and long term marketable securities other income net in 2009 was 69 million compared to other expense net of 04 million in 2008 the 2009 other income net included a relief of 46 million for a foreign nonincome based tax obligation higher interest and dividend income and lower charges for impairment on investments compared to 2008 we would also include in this category any gains or losses associated with the sale or disposal of surplus manufacturing equipment or other productive assets

other expense net of 04 million for 2008 was comprised of interest and investment income of 106 million on cash and shortterm investments during 2008 we impaired 96 million of marketable equity securities marketable fixed income securities and longterm investments in each case the market value of these securities had declined so significantly at december 31 2008 that their recovery in the foreseeable future could not be anticipated other income net of 198 million for 2007 was principally comprised of 215 million of investment income for interest on cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments only partially offset by impairment on investments

biorad’s consolidated effective tax rate was 20 31 and 22 in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively our effective tax rate decreased by approximately 11 percentage points during 2009 as compared to 2008 the decrease was primarily related to the completion in the fourth quarter of 2009 of a us income tax examination covering the years 2001 through 2005 favorable tax rates associated with higher earnings from operations in lowertax jurisdictions throughout the world and a reduction in our balance of unrecognized tax benefits due to lapses of statutes 

the 2009 2008 and 2007 effective tax rates reflected tax rate benefits of 4 4 and 5 respectively for nontaxable dividend income and 7 9 and 8 respectively for tax credits the 2009 2008 and 2007 effective tax rates also reflected benefits in the difference between us and foreign taxes of 7 4 and 2 respectively the 2008 tax rate reflected a rate detriment of 7 with respect to goodwill impairments the 2007 tax rate reflected a rate benefit of 3 for the removal of a valuation allowance related to canadian deferred tax assets

our effective tax rate may be impacted in the future either favorably or unfavorably by many factors including but not limited to statutory tax rates changes in tax laws or regulations tax audits and settlements and generation of tax credits

liquidity and capital resources 

biorad operates and conducts business globally primarily through subsidiary companies established in the markets in which we trade goods are manufactured in a small number of locations and are then shipped to local distribution facilities around the globe our product mix is diversified and certain products compete largely on product efficacy while others compete on price gross margins are generally sufficient to exceed normal operating costs funding for research and development of new products as well as routine outflows of capital expenditure and tax expense are covered by cash flow from operations our cash flow from operations is also sufficient to make interest payments in addition to the annual positive cash flow from operating activities additional liquidity is readily available via the sale of shortterm investments

the continuing financial and economic developments may adversely affect our future results of operations demand for our products and services could change more dramatically than in previous years based on activity and support levels from government universities hospitals and private industry including diagnostic laboratories a slowdown in the global economy including the united states has caused many governments to announce stimulus packages that often promote support for healthcare and research these efforts should they materialize could offset other declines to our business to date we are unable to conclude how dramatically the global economic recession or stimulus activity will impact us

at december 31 2009 we had available 7448 million in cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments under domestic and international lines of credit we had 2570 million available for borrowing as of december 31 2009 of which 82 million is reserved for standby letters of credit issued by our banks to guarantee our obligations to various companies included in the lines of credit is the 2000 million revolving credit facility which terminates on june 21 2010 unless it is renewed management believes that this availability together with cash flow from operations will be adequate to meet our current objectives for operations research and development capital additions for manufacturing and distribution plant and equipment information technology systems and future acquisitions

the deteriorated condition in credit markets along with the financial service industry experiencing upheavals characterized by bankruptcy foreclosures collapse and government intervention could impact both our ability and our customer’s ability to access the necessary capital for acquisition equipment and technology modernization and the financing of inventory and receivables without this crucial intermediary function manufacturers and end users may have to renegotiate existing arrangements for sharing additional costs reducing activity levels or seeking other business partners

cash flow from operations 

net cash provided by operations was 3251 million 1914 million and 1916 million in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively the net change between 2009 and 2008 of 1337 million represented a 1219 million improvement in the net change in cash received from customers and cash paid to suppliers the largest item that contributed to the increase in cash flows was primarily due to a decrease in inventory levels which provided approximately 36 million of cash inflows in 2009 the expiration of some patents and slower payment patterns reduced royalty payments moderation in the growth of headcount and the reduction in other sga costs all contributed to an improved cash flow additionally we experienced a reduction in taxes paid of 114 million

the small net change between 2008 and 2007 was the result of an increase in net cash collections reduced by supplier and employee payments offset by income tax payments and lower investment income and other miscellaneous operating receipts during 2008 the increase in inventory compared to 2007 was concentrated in the life science segment and the quality control product line of the clinical diagnostics segment quality control products are characterized by long lead times life science segment inventories grew to meet anticipated sales that were delayed or cancelled as economic activities declined in the fourth quarter of 2008

we regularly review the allowance for uncollectible receivables and believe net accounts receivable are fully realizable we also routinely review inventory for the impact of obsolescence and changes in market prices caused by the introduction of new products technologies and in government reimbursement policies we expect the first quarter of 2010 cash flows from operations to be lower as biorad historically makes larger payments for royalties fourth quarter sales commissions to third parties and employee annual bonuses during this period

cash flow from investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities including capital expenditures was 1760 million 1461 million and 2544 million in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively in 2007 we acquired 8596 of the outstanding shares of diamed holding ag “diamed” and in 2008 and 2009 we paid cash for the acquisition of additional diamed noncontrolling shares and two distributors that brought our ownership of diamed to 997 the acquisition of the noncontrolling shares was accounted for as an equity transaction although we own 997 of diamed there are still outstanding noncontrolling interests in certain subsidiaries acquired as part of the diamed acquisition

capital expenditures in 2009 totaled 668 million compared to 848 million and 606 million in 2008 and 2007 respectively capital expenditures represent the addition and replacement of production machinery and research equipment ongoing manufacturing and facility additions for expansions regulatory and environmental compliance and leasehold improvements also included in capital expenditures were investments in business systems and data communication upgrades and enhancements all periods included equipment placed with clinical diagnostics segment customers who then contract to purchase our reagents for use

subsequent to yearend on january 6 2010 biorad acquired certain diagnostic businesses of biotest ag for 45 million euros approximately 654 million in cash integrating the acquired portion of biotests diagnostic businesses into biorads product portfolio is expected to broaden its offering in the area of immunohematology and provide biorad access to the us markets with a range of products

we continue to review other possible acquisitions to expand both our life science and clinical diagnostics segments we routinely meet with the principals or brokers of the subject companies we are evaluating additional acquisitions on a preliminary basis it is not certain that any of these transactions will advance beyond the preliminary stages or be completed

cash flow from financing activities 

net cash provided by financing activities was 2939 million and 63 million in 2009 and 2008 and net cash used in financing activities was 75 million in 2007 net cash provided by financing activities in 2009 was primarily due to biorad issuing 3000 million principal amount of senior subordinated 8 notes in may 2009 which yielded net proceeds of 2948 million at an effective rate of 83 the net proceeds have been and will be used for working capital and general corporate purposes which may include acquisitions 

net cash provided by financing activities in 2008 principally reflected cash flow for the exercise of stock options and receipts from the employee stock purchase plan transactions partially offset by payments on longterm debt that represented the reduction of acquired diamed debt net cash used in financing activities in 2007 principally reflected payments on longterm debt that represented the reduction of acquired diamed debt partially offset by the cash flow for the exercise of stock options and receipts from the employee stock purchase plan transactions

our 2000 million revolving credit facility is secured by substantially all of our personal property assets the assets of our domestic subsidiaries and 65 of the capital stock of certain foreign subsidiaries it is guaranteed by all of our existing and future material domestic subsidiaries and expires in june 2010

the board of directors has authorized the repurchase of up to 18 million of biorad’s common stock over an indefinite period of time of which 33 million is remaining our credit agreements restrict our ability to repurchase our stock there were no share repurchases made during 2009 2008 or 2007

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements that have had or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

contractual obligations 

the following summarizes certain of our contractual obligations as of december 31 2009 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our cash flows in future periods in millions

 

recent financial accounting standards 

in january 2010 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued a standard to improve disclosures about fair value measurements specifically the standard requires entities to disclose the amounts of significant transfers between level 1 and level 2 of the fair value hierarchy and the reasons for these transfers the reasons for any transfers in or out of level 3 and information in the reconciliation of recurring level 3 measurements about purchases sales issuances and settlements on a gross basis the standard will be effective for our interim period ending march 31 2010 except for the requirement to disclose information about purchases sales issuances and settlements in the reconciliation of recurring level 3 measurements on a gross basis those disclosures will be effective for our interim period ending march 31 2011 this standard will not effect our consolidated financial statements as it is for disclosure purposes only

in october 2009 the fasb issued guidance in regard to multipledeliverable revenue arrangements and guidance in regard to certain arrangements that include software elements the guidance in regard to multipledeliverable revenue arrangements requires entities to allocate revenue in an arrangement using estimated selling prices of the delivered goods and services based on a selling price hierarchy the guidance eliminates the residual method of revenue allocation and requires revenue to be allocated using the relative selling price method the guidance in regard to certain arrangements that include software elements removes tangible products from the scope of software revenue guidance and provides guidance on determining whether software deliverables in an arrangement that includes a tangible product are covered by the scope of the software revenue guidance the two new issuances should be applied on a prospective basis for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified and will be effective for our interim period ending march 31 2011 with early adoption permitted we do not expect to adopt early and the effect of adopting these two new issuances is under review by management

in june 2009 the fasb established the fasb accounting standards codification fasb codification as the source of authoritative us gaap recognized by the fasb to be applied by nongovernmental entities the fasb codification explicitly recognizes rules and interpretive releases of the securities and exchange commission sec under authority of federal securities laws as sources of authoritative gaap for sec registrants the fasb codification became effective for our interim period ended september 30 2009 and the adoption of the fasb codification did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements

in may 2009 we adopted general standards of accounting for and disclosure of subsequent events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements

on january 1 2009 we adopted enhanced disclosures regarding fair value measurements for nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are measured or recognized at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in addition in april 2009 we adopted the following new general standards intended to provide additional application guidance and enhance disclosures regarding fair value measurements and impairments of securities

a new general standard in regard to determining fair value when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased and identifying transactions that are not orderly provides additional guidance for estimating fair value when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased the general standard also provides guidance on identifying circumstances that indicate a transaction is not orderly the effect of this new general standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements

a new general standard in regard to interim disclosures about fair value of financial instruments requires disclosures about fair value of financial instruments in interim reporting periods of publicly traded companies that were previously only required to be disclosed in annual financial statements as this general standard amends only the disclosure requirements about fair value of financial instruments in interim periods the adoption of this general standard did not affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows

a new general standard in regard to recognition and presentation of otherthantemporary impairments amends current otherthantemporary impairment guidance for debt securities to make the guidance more operational and to improve the presentation and disclosure of otherthantemporary impairments on debt and equity securities in the financial statements this general standard does not amend existing recognition and measurement guidance related to otherthantemporary impairments of equity securities the adoption of this general standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements

on january 1 2009 we adopted a new standard in regard to noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements this standard establishes new accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary it clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary minority interest is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements and separate from the parent company’s equity this statement also requires disclosure on the face of the consolidated statements of income of the amounts of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest these disclosure requirements have been applied retrospectively to all periods presented the adoption of this standard impacted certain captions previously used on the consolidated statements of income largely identifying net income including noncontrolling interests and net income attributable to biorad certain captions on the consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of cash flows have also changed

on january 1 2009 we adopted new guidance in regard to determining whether instruments granted in sharebased payment transactions are participating securities this guidance concluded that unvested sharebased payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents whether paid or unpaid are participating securities and shall be included in the computation of earnings per share eps pursuant to the twoclass method the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our eps data in 2009 or on eps for any prior periods

item 7a quantitive and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

financial risk management 

the main goal of biorad’s financial risk management program is to reduce the variance in expected cash flows arising from unexpected foreign exchange rate and interest rate changes financial exposures are managed through operational means and by using various financial instruments including cash and liquid resources borrowings and forward and spot foreign exchange contracts no derivative financial instruments are entered into for the purpose of trading or speculation company policy requires that all derivative positions are undertaken to manage the risks arising from underlying business activities these derivative transactions do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment per general standards for derivatives and hedging derivative instruments used in these transactions are valued at fair value and changes in fair value are included in reported earnings

foreign exchange risk we operate and conduct business in many countries and are exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates we face transactional currency exposures that arise when we enter into transactions denominated in currencies other than us dollars additionally our consolidated net equity is impacted by the conversion of the net assets of our international subsidiaries for which the functional currency is not the us dollar

foreign currency exposures are managed on a centralized basis this allows for the netting of natural offsets and lowers transaction costs and net exposures where possible we seek to manage our foreign exchange risk in part through operational means including matching samecurrency revenues to same currency costs and samecurrency assets to samecurrency liabilities moreover weakening in one currency can often be offset by strengthening in another currency foreign exchange risk is also managed through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts positions are primarily in euro swiss franc british sterling and japanese yen the majority of forward contracts are for periods of 90 days or less we record the change in value of our foreign currency receivables and payables as a foreign exchange gain loss on our consolidated statements of income along with the change in fair market value of the forward exchange contract used as an economic hedge of those assets or liabilities

our forward contract holdings at yearend were analyzed to determine their sensitivity to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates all other variables were held constant market risk associated with derivative holdings is the potential change in fair value of derivative positions arising from an adverse movement in foreign exchange rates a decline of 10 on quoted foreign exchange rates would result in an approximate netpresentvalue loss of 33 million on our derivative position this impact of a change in exchange rates excludes the offset derived from the change in value of the underlying assets and liabilities which could reduce the adverse effect significantly

interest rate risk of debt instruments biorad centrally manages the shortterm cash surpluses and shortfalls of its subsidiaries our holdings of variable rate debt instruments at yearend were analyzed to determine their sensitivity to movements in interest rates due to the relatively small amount of shortterm variable rate debt we have outstanding there would not be a material impact to earnings or cash flows if interest rates moved adversely by 10 our longterm debt consists primarily of fixedrate instruments and is thus insulated from interest rate changes as of december 31 2009 the overall interest rate risk associated with our debt was not significant

changes in internal control over financial reporting

there has been no change in our internal controls over financial reporting during our most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal controls over financial reporting

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting

the management of biorad laboratories inc is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in rule 13a15f under the securities and exchange act of 1934 as amended exchange act our internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the preparation and fair presentation of our financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles

an internal control system over financial reporting has inherent limitations and may not prevent or detect misstatements therefore even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation

management has used the framework set forth in the report entitled “internal control – integrated framework” published by the committee of sponsoring organizations coso of the treadway commission to evaluate the effectiveness of biorad’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2009 based on that evaluation our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 2009 to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america we reviewed the results of management’s assessment with the audit committee of our board of directors

report of ernst  young llp independent registered public accounting firm 

the board of directors and stockholders of biorad laboratories inc 

we have audited biorad laboratories inc’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2009 based on criteria established in internal control – integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission “the coso criteria” biorad laboratories inc’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying management’s report on internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

in our opinion biorad laboratories inc maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2009 based on the coso criteria 

we also have audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the consolidated financial statements of biorad laboratories inc as of and for the year ended december 31 2009 and our report dated february 26 2010 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon

business

general

founded in 1952 and incorporated in 1957 biorad laboratories inc referred to in this report as “biorad” “we” “us” and “our” was initially engaged in the development and produc­tion of specialty chemicals used in biochemical pharmaceutical and other life science research applications in 1967 biorad entered the field of clinical diagnostics with the development of its first test kit based on separation techniques and materials developed for life science research biorad expanded into the field of analytical and measuring instrument systems through internal research and development efforts and acquisitions in the late 1970s and 1980s in 1999 biorad acquired the stock of pasteur sanofi diagnostics and the rights to certain ancillary assets this strengthened our position in the hiv and infectious disease diagnostic product market in 2000 and 2004 biorad divested its semiconductor optoelectronic metrology and confocal microscopy product lines in late 2007 we acquired 777 of the registered shares or 8596 of the outstanding shares of diamed holding ag during 2008 we acquired additional shares of diamed bringing our total ownership percentage to 9346 at december 31 2008 these acquisitions have enhanced our position in the immunohematology market

as biorad broadened its product lines it also expanded its geographical market biorad has distribution channels in over thirty countries outside the united states through subsidiaries whose primary focus is customer service and product distribution

biorad manufactures and supplies the life science research healthcare analytical chemistry and other markets with a broad range of products and systems used to separate complex chemical and biological materials and to identify analyze and purify their components

description of business 

business segments 

today biorad operates in two industry segments designated as life science and clinical diagnostics both segments operate worldwide for a description of business and financial information on industry and geographic segments see note 14 on pages 30 through 33 of exhibit 131 which is incorporated herein by reference

life science segment

life science is the study of the characteristics behavior and structure of living organisms and their component systems life science researchers use a variety of products and systems including reagents instruments software and apparatus to advance the study of life processes drug discovery biotechnology and food pathogen testing primarily within a laboratory setting

we focus on selected segments of the life science market which we estimate to be approximately 4 billion the primary technological applications that we supply to these segments consist of electrophoresis image analysis molecular detection chromatography gene transfer sample preparation and amplification the primary endusers in our sectors of the market are universities and medical schools industrial research organizations government agencies pharmaceutical manufacturers biotechnology researchers and food testing laboratories

clinical diagnostics segment

the global clinical diagnostic market is estimated to be approximately 35 billion in 2008 and growing at four to five percent annually we estimate the worldwide clinical diagnostics segment in which we participate to be approximately 10 billion the market encompasses a broad array of technologies incorporated into a variety of products used to detect identify monitor and quantify substances in patient and donor blood or other bodily fluids and tissues the vast majority of these tests are performed in vitro outside the body the information generated by these tests helps physicians diagnose disease and guide patient therapy and treatment all of which helps improve patient care it is estimated that diagnostic testing influences nearly seventy percent of patient care decisions made by doctors while comprising less than five percent of total healthcare costs

the market is split into several sub segments consisting of clinical chemistry immunoassay microbiology hematology molecular coagulation blood banking and blood typing biorad has significant positions in blood virus testing blood banking and immunoassay immunohematology blood typing hemoglobin a1c testing for diabetes monitoring clinical chemistry and immunoassay autoimmune disease testing immunoassay and quality control crossing all sub segments

consumers of clinical diagnostic products are hospital laboratories reference laboratories physician office laboratories government agencies and diagnostic manufacturers purchasing decisions are normally based on improving the healthcare of patients improving laboratory efficiency and reducing overall costs biorads products and services generally meet or exceed these criteria leading to strong customer loyalty and recurring revenue exceeding eighty percent of total sales

raw materials and components 

we utilize a wide variety of chemicals biological materials electronic components machined metal parts optical parts minicomputers and peripheral devices most of these materials and components are available from numerous sources and we have not experienced difficulty in securing adequate supplies

patents and trademarks 

we own numerous us and international patents and patent licenses we believe however that our ability to develop and manufacture our products depends primarily on our knowledge technology and special skills we pay royalties on the sales of certain products under several patent license agreements we view these patents and license agreements as valuable assets

seasonal operations and backlog 

our business is not inherently seasonal however the european custom of concentrating vacation during the summer months usually tempers third quarter sales volume and operating income

for the most part we operate in markets characterized by short lead times and the absence of significant backlogs management has concluded that backlog information is not material to our business as a whole

sales and marketing 

each of biorads segments maintains a sales force to sell its products on a direct basis each sales force is technically trained in the disciplines associated with its products sales are also generated through direct mail advertising exhibits at trade shows and technical meetings telemarketing ecommerce and by extensive advertising in technical and trade publications sales and marketing efforts are augmented by technical service departments that assist customers in effective product utilization and in new product applications we also produce and distribute technical literature and hold seminars for customers on the use of our products

our customer base is broad and diversified in 2008 no single customer accounted for more than 2 of our total net sales our sales are affected by certain external factors for example a number of our customers particularly in the life science segment are substantially dependent on government grants and research contracts for their funding a significant reduction of government funding would have a detrimental effect on the results of this segment

most of our international sales are generated by our whollyowned subsidiaries and their branch offices certain of these subsidiaries also have manufacturing facilities biorad’s international operations are subject to certain risks common to foreign operations in general such as changes in governmental regulations import restrictions and foreign exchange fluctuations however our international operations are principally in developed nations which we regard as presenting no significantly greater risks to our operations than are present in the united states

competition 

the markets served by our product groups are highly competitive our competitors range in size from startups to large multinational corporations with significant resources and reach reliable independent information on sales and market share of products produced by our competitors is not generally available we believe however based on our own estimates no one company is so dominant that it prevents other companies including biorad from competing effectively we compete mainly in market segments where our products and technology offer customers specific advantages over the competition we tend to avoid head to head competition against entrenched competitors with metoo products

because of the breadth of its product lines the life science segment does not face the same competitors for all of its products competitors in this market include ge biosciences qiagen thermo fisher scientific and life technologies we compete primarily based on meeting performance specifications

major competitors in the clinical diagnostic segment include roche abbott laboratories diagnostic division siemens medical diagnostics solutions formerly dadebehring diagnostics products corporation and bayer diagnostics beckman coulter bectondickinson biomérieux johnson  johnson ortho clinical diagnostics thermo fisher tosoh immucor cepheid and diasorin

product research and development 

we conduct extensive product research and development activities in all areas of our business employing approximately 790 people worldwide in these activities research and development have played a major role in biorads growth and are expected to continue to do so in the future our research teams are continuously developing new products and new applications for existing products in our development and testing of new products and applications we consult with scientific and medical professionals at universities hospitals and medical schools and in industry excluding inprocess research and development we spent approximately 1595 million 1405 million and 1234 million on research and development activities during the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively

regulatory matters 

the manufacturing marketing and labeling of certain of our products primarily diagnostic products are subject to regulation in the united states by the center for devices and radiological health of the united states food and drug administration fda and in other jurisdictions by state and foreign government authorities fda regulations require that some new products have premarketing approval by the fda and require certain products to be manufactured in accordance with “good manufacturing practices” to be extensively tested and to be properly labeled to disclose test results and performance claims and limitations

as a multinational manufacturer and distributor of sophisticated instrumentation equipment we must meet a wide array of electromagnetic compatibility and safety compliance requirements to satisfy regulations in the united states the european community and other jurisdictions these requirements relating to testing and trials product licensing pricing and reimbursement vary widely among countries

our operations are subject to federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations that govern such activities as transportation of goods emissions to air and discharges to water as well as handling and disposal practices for solid hazardous and medical wastes in addition to environmental laws that regulate our operations we are also subject to environmental laws and regulations that create liabilities and cleanup responsibility for spills disposals or other releases of hazardous substances into the environment as a result of our operations or otherwise impacting real property that we own or operate the environmental laws and regulations could also subject us to claims by third parties for damages resulting from any spills disposals or releases resulting from our operations or at any of our properties 

employees 

at december 31 2008 biorad had approximately 6600 fulltime employees fewer than 8 of biorads approximately 2830 u s employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement which will expire on november 7 2009 many of biorads nonus fulltime employees especially in france are covered by collective bargaining agreements biorad considers its employee relations in general to be good

 item 1a 

risk factors 

tableend 

 recent global market and economic conditions have been unprecedented and challenging with tighter credit conditions and recession in most major economies expected to continue into 2009 continued concerns about the systemic impact of potential longterm and widespread recession energy costs geopolitical issues the availability and cost of credit and the global housing and mortgage markets have contributed to increased market volatility and diminished expectations for western and emerging economies in the second half of 2008 added concerns fueled by the us government conservatorship of the federal home loan mortgage corporation and the federal national mortgage association the declared bankruptcy of lehman brothers holdings inc the us government financial assistance to american international group inc citibank bank of america and other federal government interventions in the us financial system lead to increased market uncertainty and instability in both us and international capital and credit markets these conditions combined with volatile oil prices declining business and consumer confidence and increased unemployment have contributed to volatility of unprecedented levels

as a result of these market conditions the cost and availability of credit has been and may continue to be adversely affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads concern about the stability of the markets generally and the strength of counterparties specifically has led many lenders and institutional investors to reduce and in some cases cease to provide credit to businesses and consumers these factors have lead to a decrease in spending by businesses and consumers alike our customers and vendors may experience cash flow concerns and as a result customers may modify delay or cancel plans to purchase our products and vendors may increase their prices reduce their output or change terms of sales additionally if customers’ or vendors’ operating and financial performance deteriorates or if they are unable to make scheduled payments or obtain credit customers may not be able to pay or may delay payment of amounts owed to us and vendors may restrict credit or impose different payment terms any inability of current andor potential customers to pay us for our products or any demands by vendors for different payment terms may adversely affect our earnings and cash flow additionally strengthening of the us dollar associated with the global financial crisis may adversely affect the results of our international operations when those results are translated into us dollars furthermore the disruption in the credit markets could impede our access to capital which could be further adversely affected if we are unable to maintain our current credit ratings should we have limited access to additional financing sources we may need to defer capital expenditures or seek other sources of liquidity which may not be available to us on acceptable terms if at all continued turbulence in the us and international markets and economies and prolonged declines in business consumer spending may adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition and the liquidity and financial condition of our customers including our ability to refinance maturing liabilities and access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs

 

as part of our overall business strategy we pursue acquisitions of and investments in complementary companies products and technologies in order to be successful in these activities we must among other things 

 

the benefits of any acquisition may prove to be less than anticipated and may not outweigh the costs reported in our financial statements completing any potential future acquisition could cause significant diversion of our management’s time and resources if we acquire new companies products or technologies we may be required to assume contingent liabilities or record impairment charges for goodwill and other intangible assets over time we cannot assure you that we will successfully overcome these risks or any other problems we encounter in connection with any acquisitions and any such acquisitions could adversely affect our business financial position or operating results

 

the life science and clinical diagnostics markets are each highly competitive some of our competitors have greater financial resources than we do and are less leveraged than we are making them better equipped to license technologies and intellectual property from third parties or to fund research and development manufacturing and marketing efforts moreover competitive and regulatory conditions in many markets in which we operate restrict our ability to fully recover through price increases higher costs of acquired goods and services resulting from inflation and other drivers of cost increases our competitors can be expected to continue to improve the design and performance of their products and to introduce new products with competitive price and performance characteristics maintaining these advantages will require us to continue to invest in research and development sales and marketing and customer service and support we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient resources to continue to make such investments or that we will be successful in maintaining such advantages 

 

a significant portion of our sales are made outside of the united states our foreign subsidiaries generated 70 of our net sales in the year ended december 31 2008 our international operations are subject to risks common to foreign operations such as general economic and market conditions in the countries in which we operate changes in governmental regulations political instability import restrictions and currency exchange rate risks we cannot assure you that shifts in currency exchange rates especially significant strengthening of the us dollar compared to the euro will not have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

 

our customers include universities clinical diagnostics laboratories government agencies hospitals and pharmaceutical biotechnology and chemical companies the capital spending programs of these institutions and companies have a significant effect on the demand for our products such policies are based on a wide variety of factors including the resources available to make such purchases the availability of funding from grants by governments or government agencies the spending priorities among various types of equipment and the policies regarding capital expenditures during industry downturns or recessionary periods if government funding to our customers were to decrease or if our customers were to decrease or reallocate their budgets in a manner adverse to us our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

healthcare reform and the growth of managed care organizations have been and continue to be significant factors in the clinical diagnostics market the trend towards managed care together with efforts to reform the healthcare delivery system in the united states and europe has resulted in increased pressure on healthcare providers and other participants in the healthcare industry to reduce costs consolidation among healthcare providers has resulted in fewer more powerful groups whose purchasing power gives them cost containment leverage these competitive

forces place constraints on the levels of overall pricing and thus could have a material adverse effect on our profit margins for products we sell in clinical diagnostics markets to the extent that the healthcare industry seeks to address the need to contain costs by limiting the number of clinical tests being performed our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected if these changes in the healthcare markets in the united states and europe continue we could be forced to alter our approach in selling marketing distributing and servicing our products 

 

our future success depends on our ability to continue to improve our product offerings and develop and introduce new product lines and extensions that integrate new technological advances if we are unable to integrate technological advances into our product offerings or to design develop manufacture and market new product lines and extensions successfully and in a timely manner our operating results will be adversely affected we cannot assure you that our product and process development efforts will be successful or that new products we introduce will achieve market acceptance 

 

our information technology it systems are an integral part of our business and a serious disruption of our it systems could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations we depend on our it systems to process orders manage inventory and collect accounts receivable our it systems also allow us to efficiently purchase products from our suppliers and ship products to our customers on a timely basis maintain costeffective operations and provide customer service we cannot assure you that our contingency plans will allow us to operate at our current level of efficiency 

our ability to implement our business plan in a rapidly evolving market requires effective planning reporting and analytical processes we expect that we will need to continue to improve and further integrate our it systems reporting systems and operating procedures by training and educating our employees with respect to these improvements and integrations on an ongoing basis in order to effectively run our business if we fail to successfully manage and integrate our it reporting systems and operating procedures it could adversely affect our business or operating results 

 

we rely on a combination of copyright trade secret patent and trademark laws and thirdparty nondisclosure agreements to protect our intellectual property rights and products however we cannot assure you that our intellectual property rights will not be challenged invalidated circumvented or rendered unenforceable or that meaningful protection or adequate remedies will be available to us for instance it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy our intellectual property to reverse engineer or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary or to develop equivalent technologies independently additionally third parties may assert patent copyright and other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to us if we are unable to license or otherwise access protected technology used in our products or if we lose our rights under any existing licenses we could be prohibited from manufacturing and marketing such products we may find it necessary to enforce our patents or other intellectual property rights or to defend ourselves against claimed infringement of the rights of others through litigation which could result in substantial costs to us and divert our resources we also could incur substantial costs to redesign our products to defend any legal action taken against us or to pay damages to an infringed party the foregoing matters could adversely impact our business 

 

some of our products primarily diagnostic products production processes and marketing are subject to federal state local and foreign regulation including the fda and its foreign counterparts we are also subject to government regulation of the use and handling of a number of materials and controlled substances failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in substantial liability to us suspension or cessation of our operations restrictions on our ability to expand at our present locations or require us to make significant capital expenditures or incur other significant expenses 

 

our operations are subject to federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations that govern such activities as transportation of goods emissions to air and discharges to water as well as handling and disposal practices for solid hazardous and medical wastes in addition to environmental laws that regulate our operations we are also subject to environmental laws and regulations that create liability and cleanup responsibility for spills disposals or other releases of hazardous substances into the environment as a result of our operations or otherwise impacting real property that we own or operate the environmental laws and regulations also subject us to claims by third parties for damages resulting from any spills disposals or releases resulting from our operations or at any of our properties 

we may in the future incur capital and operating costs to comply with currently existing laws and regulations and possible new statutory enactments and these expenditures may be significant we have incurred and may in the future incur fines related to environmental matters and liability for costs or damages related to spills or other releases of hazardous substances into the environment at sites where we have operated or at offsite locations where we have sent hazardous substances for disposal in that regard we currently are investigating soil and groundwater contamination at one of our properties under the oversight of a state agency based on the currently available information we believe that the costs to clean up this contamination will not have a material adverse effect on the future results of our operations or our financial condition we can provide no assurance however that such matters or any future obligations to comply with environmental laws and regulations will not have a material impact on our operations or financial condition 

 

our products and services are highly technical in nature in general only highly qualified and trained scientists have the necessary skills to develop and market our products and provide our services in addition some of our manufacturing positions are highly technical we face intense competition for these professionals from our competitors customers marketing partners and other companies throughout our industry we generally do not enter into employment agreements requiring these employees to continue in our employment for any period of time any failure on our part to hire train and retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel could substantially damage our business additionally if we were to lose a sufficient number of our research and development scientists and were unable to replace them or satisfy our needs for research and development through outsourcing it could adversely affect our business 

 

we have two classes of voting stock class a common stock and class b common stock with a few exceptions holders of class a and class b common stock vote as a single class when voting as a single class each share of class a common stock is entitled to onetenth of a vote while each share of class b common stock has one vote in the election or removal of directors the classes vote separately and the holders of class a common stock are entitled to elect 25 of the board of directors with holders of class b common stock electing the remaining directors 

as of february 17 2009 the schwartz family collectively held approximately 16 of our class a common stock and 90 of our class b common stock as a result the schwartz family is able to elect a majority of the directors effect fundamental changes in our direction and control matters affecting us including the allocation of business opportunities that may be suitable for our company in addition this concentration of ownership and voting power may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company 

the schwartz family may exercise its control over us according to interests that are different from other investors’ or debtors’ interests

 

the design and effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting may not prevent all errors misstatements or misrepresentations we cannot assure you that our disclosure controls and procedures over internal control of financial reporting will be effective in accomplishing all control objectives all of the time deficiencies particularly a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting which may occur in the future could result in misstatements of our results of operations restatements of our financial statements a decline in our stock price or otherwise materially adversely affect our business reputation results of operation financial condition or liquidity

  

we have significant manufacturing and distribution facilities located in southern and northern california california has experienced a number of earthquakes wildfires flooding landslides and other natural disasters in recent years the occurrences could damage or destroy our facilities which may result in interruptions to our business and losses that exceed our insurance coverage terrorist attacks such as those that occurred on september 11 2001 have contributed to economic instability in the united states and further acts of terrorism bioterrorism violence or war could affect the markets in which we operate our business operations our expectations and other forwardlooking statements contained or incorporated in this document any of these events could cause a decrease in our revenue earnings and cash flows

we may incur losses in future periods due to writedowns in the value of financial instruments 

we have positions in a variety of financial instruments including asset backed securities and other similar instruments financial markets are quite volatile and the markets for these securities can be illiquid the value of these securities will continue to be impacted by external market factors including default rates changes in the value of the underlying property such as residential or commercial real estate rating agency actions the prices at which observable market transactions occur and the financial strength of various entities such as financial guarantors who provide insurance for the securities should we need to liquidate these positions for cash our ability to sell these instruments without significant losses may also be limited by the market environment 

 

as of december 31 2008 we and our subsidiaries have approximately 4531 million of outstanding indebtedness in addition the indenture governing our notes permits us to incur additional debt provided we comply with the limitation on the incurrence of additional indebtedness and disqualified capital stock covenants contained in the indenture 

the following chart shows certain important credit statistics

 

 

the incurrence of substantial amounts of debt may have important consequences for instance it could 

 

our ability to satisfy our obligations and to reduce our total debt depends on our future operating performance and on economic financial competitive and other factors many of which are beyond our control our business may not generate sufficient cash flow and future financings may not be available to provide sufficient net proceeds to meet these obligations or to successfully execute our business strategy

 

the indenture governing our notes and the terms of other debt instruments including without limitation our credit facilities and other agreements we may enter in the future contain or will contain covenants imposing significant restrictions on our business these restrictions may affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise these covenants place restrictions on our ability to among other things 

 

our existing credit facility also requires that we meet certain financial tests and maintain certain financial ratios including a maximum consolidated leverage ratio test minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio test and a minimum net worth test 

our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control including prevailing economic financial and industry conditions the breach of any of these restrictions could result in a default an event of default under our debt agreements would permit some of our lenders to declare all amounts borrowed from them to be due and payable together with accrued and unpaid interest if we were unable to repay debt to our senior secured lenders these lenders could proceed against the collateral securing that debt the collateral is substantially all of our personal property assets the assets of our domestic subsidiaries and 65 of the capital stock of certain foreign subsidiaries in addition acceleration of our other indebtedness may cause us to be unable to make interest payments on our notes and repay the principal amount of the notes or may cause the future subsidiary guarantors if any to be unable to make payments under the guarantees

business 

tableend 

general

founded in 1952 and incorporated in 1957 biorad laboratories inc referred to in this report as “biorad” “we” “us” and “our” was initially engaged in the development and produc­tion of specialty chemicals used in biochemical pharmaceutical and other life science research applications in 1967 biorad entered the field of clinical diagnostics with the development of its first test kit based on separation techniques and materials developed for life science research biorad expanded into the field of analytical and measuring instrument systems through internal research and development efforts and acquisitions in the late 1970s and 1980s in 1999 biorad acquired the stock of pasteur sanofi diagnostics and the rights to certain ancillary assets this strengthened our position in the hiv and infectious disease diagnostic product market in 2000 and 2004 biorad divested its semiconductor optoelectronic metrology and confocal microscopy product lines in late 2007 we acquired 777 of the registered shares or 8596 of the outstanding shares of diamed holding ag this acquisition has enhanced our position in the immunahematology market

as biorad broadened its product lines it also expanded its geographical market biorad has distribution channels in over thirty countries outside the united states through subsidiaries whose primary focus is customer service and product distribution

biorad manufactures and supplies the life science research healthcare analytical chemistry and other markets with a broad range of products and systems used to separate complex chemical and biological materials and to identify analyze and purify their components

description of business 

business segments 

today biorad operates in two industry segments designated as life science and clinical diagnostics both segments operate worldwide for a description of business and financial information on industry and geographic segments see note 15 on pages 34 through 37 of exhibit 131 which is incorporated herein by reference

life science segment

life science is the study of the characteristics behavior and structure of living organisms and their component systems life science researchers use a variety of products and systems including reagents instruments software and apparatus to advance the study of life processes drug discovery biotechnology and food pathogen testing primarily within a laboratory setting

we focus on selected segments of the life science market which we estimate to be approximately 4 billion the primary technological applications that we supply to these segments consist of electrophoresis image analysis molecular detection chromatography gene transfer sample preparation and amplification the primary endusers in our sectors of the market are universities and medical schools industrial research organizations government agencies pharmaceutical manufacturers biotechnology researchers and food testing laboratories

clinical diagnostics segment

the clinical diagnostics market encompasses a broad array of technologies incorporated into a variety of tests used to detect identify and quantify substances in blood or other body fluids and tissues the test results are used as aids for medical diagnosis detection evaluation monitoring and treatment of diseases and other medical conditions in humans the bulk of tests are performed in vitro “outside the body” while the remainder consist of in vivo “in the body” tests the most common type of in vitro tests are routine chemistry tests that measure important health parameters such as glucose cholesterol or sodium as part of routine blood checks other diagnostic tests are more specialized and require more sophisticated equipment and materials than do routine tests these specialized tests are typically lowervolume and higherpriced than routine tests we estimate the global clinical diagnostics market in which we participate to be approximately 10 billion

the primary endusers of clinical diagnostics are hospital laboratories reference laboratories physician office laboratories government agencies and other diagnostics manufacturers

raw materials and components 

we utilize a wide variety of chemicals biological materials electronic components machined metal parts optical parts minicomputers and peripheral devices most of these materials and components are available from numerous sources and we have not experienced difficulty in securing adequate supplies

patents and trademarks 

we own numerous us and international patents and patent licenses we believe however that our ability to develop and manufacture our products depends primarily on our knowledge technology and special skills we pay royalties on the sales of certain products under several patent license agreements we view these patents and license agreements as valuable assets

seasonal operations and backlog 

our business is not inherently seasonal however the european custom of concentrating vacation during the summer months usually tempers third quarter sales volume and operating income

for the most part we operate in markets characterized by short lead times and the absence of significant backlogs management has concluded that backlog information is not material to our business as a whole

sales and marketing 

each of biorads segments maintains a sales force to sell its products on a direct basis each sales force is technically trained in the disciplines associated with its products sales are also generated through direct mail advertising exhibits at trade shows and technical meetings telemarketing ecommerce and by extensive advertising in technical and trade publications sales and marketing efforts are augmented by technical service departments that assist customers in effective product utilization and in new product applications we also produce and distribute technical literature and hold seminars for customers on the use of our products

our customer base is broad and diversified in 2007 no single customer accounted for more than 2 of our total net sales our sales are affected by certain external factors for example a number of our customers particularly in the life science segment are substantially dependent on government grants and research contracts for their funding a significant reduction of government funding would have a detrimental effect on the results of this segment

most of our international sales are generated by our whollyowned subsidiaries and their branch offices certain of these subsidiaries also have manufacturing facilities while biorads international operations are subject to certain risks common to foreign operations in general such as changes in governmental regulations import restrictions and foreign exchange fluctuations our international operations are principally in developed nations which we regard as presenting no significantly greater risks to its operations than are present in the united states

competition 

most markets served by our product groups are competitive our competitors range in size from startups to large multinational corporations reliable independent information on sales and market share of products produced by our competitors is not generally available we believe however based on our own marketing information that while some competitors are dominant with respect to certain individual products no one company including us is dominant with respect to a material portion of any segment of our business

because of the breadth of its product lines the life science segment does not face the same competitors for all of its products competitors in this market include ge biosciences invitrogen qiagen thermo fisher scientific and applied biosystems we compete primarily based on meeting performance specifications

competitors in the clinical diagnostics segment range in size from small private companies to large multinational corporations we compete mainly in specific market niches and do not attempt to pursue the most competitive general diagnostics markets we compete based on our technological ability to provide customers with very specific tests and believe we are usually a significant competitor within our market niche competitors include abbott laboratories biomérieux ocd roche diagnostics tosoh inova diasorin and siemens

product research and development 

we conduct extensive product research and development activities in all areas of our business employing approximately 810 people worldwide in these activities research and development have played a major role in biorads growth and are expected to continue to do so in the future our research teams are continuously developing new products and new applications for existing products in our development and testing of new products and applications we consult with scientific and medical professionals at universities hospitals and medical schools and in industry excluding inprocess research and development we spent approximately 1405 million 1234 million and 1151 million on research and development activities during the years ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively

regulatory matters 

the manufacturing marketing and labeling of certain of our products primarily diagnostic products are subject to regulation in the united states by the center for devices and radiological health of the united states food and drug administration fda and in other jurisdictions by state and foreign government authorities fda regulations require that some new products have premarketing approval by the fda and require certain products to be manufactured in accordance with “good manufacturing practices” to be extensively tested and to be properly labeled to disclose test results and performance claims and limitations

as a multinational manufacturer and distributor of sophisticated instrumentation equipment we must meet a wide array of electromagnetic compatibility and safety compliance requirements to satisfy regulations in the united states the european community and other jurisdictions these requirements relating to testing and trials product licensing pricing and reimbursement vary widely among countries

our operations are subject to federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations that govern such activities as transportation of goods emissions to air and discharges to water as well as handling and disposal practices for solid hazardous and medical wastes in addition to environmental laws that regulate our operations we are also subject to environmental laws and regulations that create liabilities and cleanup responsibility for spills disposals or other releases of hazardous substances into the environment as a result of our operations or otherwise impacting real property that we own or operate the environmental laws and regulations could also subject us to claims by third parties for damages resulting from any spills disposals or releases resulting from our operations or at any of our properties 

employees 

at december 31 2007 biorad had approximately 6400 fulltime employees fewer than 8 of biorads approximately 2760 u s employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement which will expire on november 7 2009 many of biorads nonus fulltime employees especially in france are covered by collective bargaining agreements biorad considers its employee relations in general to be good

risk factors

 

 

tableend 

 

on october 1 2007 we acquired approximately 777 of the registered shares or 8596 of the outstanding shares of diamed a private swiss company which prior to the acquisition had not been subject to the requirements of united states generally accepted accounting principles including interim reporting we must assess and test their disclosure controls procedures and internal controls over financial reporting in 2008 achieving the benefits of our acquisition of diamed depends on the timely efficient and successful execution of a number of postacquisition events including integrating the acquired business into biorad factors that could affect our ability to achieve these benefits include

 

 

we cannot assure you that we will successfully overcome these risks or any other problems we encounter in connection with this acquisition this acquisition could adversely affect our business financial position or operating results

 

the life science and clinical diagnostics markets are each highly competitive some of our competitors have greater financial resources than we do and are less leveraged than we are making them better equipped to license technologies and intellectual property from third parties or to fund research and development manufacturing and marketing efforts moreover competitive and regulatory conditions in many markets in which we operate restrict our ability to fully recover through price increases higher costs of acquired goods and services resulting from inflation and other drivers of cost increases our competitors can be expected to continue to improve the design and performance of their products and to introduce new products with competitive price and performance characteristics maintaining these advantages will require us to continue to invest in research and development sales and marketing and customer service and support we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient resources to continue to make such investments or that we will be successful in maintaining such advantages 

 

a significant portion of our sales are made outside of the united states our foreign subsidiaries generated 66 of our net sales in the year ended december 31 2007 our international operations are subject to risks common to foreign operations such as general economic and market conditions in the countries in which we operate changes in governmental regulations political instability import restrictions and currency exchange rate risks we cannot assure you that shifts in currency exchange rates especially significant strengthening of the us dollar compared to the euro will not have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

 

our customers include universities clinical diagnostics laboratories government agencies hospitals and pharmaceutical biotechnology and chemical companies the capital spending policies of these institutions and companies have a significant effect on the demand for our products such policies are based on a wide variety of factors including the resources available to make such purchases the availability of funding from grants by governments or government agencies the spending priorities among various types of equipment and the policies regarding capital expenditures during industry downturns or recessionary periods if government funding to our customers were to decrease or if our customers were to decrease or reallocate their budgets in a manner adverse to us our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

healthcare reform and the growth of managed care organizations have been and continue to be significant factors in the clinical diagnostics market the trend towards managed care together with efforts to reform the healthcare delivery system in the united states and europe has resulted in increased pressure on healthcare providers and other participants in the healthcare industry to reduce costs consolidation among healthcare providers has resulted in fewer more powerful groups whose purchasing power gives them cost containment leverage these competitive forces place constraints on the levels of overall pricing and thus could have a material adverse effect on our profit margins for products we sell in clinical diagnostics markets to the extent that the healthcare industry seeks to address the need to contain costs by limiting the number of clinical tests being performed our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected if these changes in the healthcare markets in the united states and europe continue we could be forced to alter our approach in selling marketing distributing and servicing our products 

 

a portion of our revenues and profits derive from the sale of our tests for bovine spongiform encephalopathy bse or “mad cow” disease we believe that there are multiple other competitors that offer bse tests approved by regulatory authorities in europe and japan further government subsidies have supported purchases by our customers of bse tests if governments in our key markets cease or substantially reduce the subsidies provided we may have to lower prices for or experience reduced sales of our bse tests finally if the threat to the world food supply from bse was materially reduced either through eradication of bse or otherwise sales of bse tests would materially decline if any of these events were to occur it could have a material negative impact on our financial condition or results of operations

 

our future success depends on our ability to continue to improve our product offerings and develop and introduce new product lines and extensions that integrate new technological advances if we are unable to integrate technological advances into our product offerings or to design develop manufacture and market new product lines and extensions successfully and in a timely manner our operating results will be adversely affected we cannot assure you that our product and process development efforts will be successful or that new products we introduce will achieve market acceptance 

 

our information technology it systems are an integral part of our business and a serious disruption of our it systems could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations we depend on our it systems to process orders manage inventory and collect accounts receivable our it systems also allow us to efficiently purchase products from our suppliers and ship products to our customers on a timely basis maintain costeffective operations and provide customer service we cannot assure you that our contingency plans will allow us to operate at our current level of efficiency 

our ability to implement our business plan in a rapidly evolving market requires effective planning reporting and analytical processes we expect that we will need to continue to improve and further integrate our it systems reporting systems and operating procedures by training and educating our employees with respect to these improvements and integrations on an ongoing basis in order to effectively run our business if we fail to successfully manage and integrate our it reporting systems and operating procedures it could adversely affect our business or operating results 

 

we rely on a combination of copyright trade secret patent and trademark laws and thirdparty nondisclosure agreements to protect our intellectual property rights and products however we cannot assure you that our intellectual property rights will not be challenged invalidated circumvented or rendered unenforceable or that meaningful protection or adequate remedies will be available to us for instance it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy our intellectual property to reverse engineer or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary or to develop equivalent technologies independently additionally third parties may assert patent copyright and other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to us if we are unable to license or otherwise access protected technology used in our products or if we lose our rights under any existing licenses we could be prohibited from manufacturing and marketing such products we may find it necessary to enforce our patents or other intellectual property rights or to defend ourselves against claimed infringement of the rights of others through litigation which could result in substantial costs to us and divert our resources we also could incur substantial costs to redesign our products to defend any legal action taken against us or to pay damages to an infringed party the foregoing matters could adversely impact our business 

 

some of our products primarily diagnostic products production processes and marketing are subject to federal state local and foreign regulation including the fda and its foreign counterparts we are also subject to government regulation of the use and handling of a number of materials and controlled substances failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in substantial liability to us suspension or cessation of our operations restrictions on our ability to expand at our present locations or require us to make significant capital expenditures or incur other significant expenses 

 

our operations are subject to federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations that govern such activities as transportation of goods emissions to air and discharges to water as well as handling and disposal practices for solid hazardous and medical wastes in addition to environmental laws that regulate our operations we are also subject to environmental laws and regulations that create liability and cleanup responsibility for spills disposals or other releases of hazardous substances into the environment as a result of our operations or otherwise impacting real property that we own or operate the environmental laws and regulations also subject us to claims by third parties for damages resulting from any spills disposals or releases resulting from our operations or at any of our properties 

we may in the future incur capital and operating costs to comply with currently existing laws and regulations and possible new statutory enactments and these expenditures may be significant we have incurred and may in the future incur fines related to environmental matters and liability for costs or damages related to spills or other releases of hazardous substances into the environment at sites where we have operated or at offsite locations where we have sent hazardous substances for disposal in that regard we currently are investigating soil and groundwater contamination at one of our properties under the oversight of a state agency based on the currently available information we believe that the costs to clean up this contamination will not have a material adverse effect on the future results of our operations or our financial condition we can provide no assurance however that such matters or any future obligations to comply with environmental laws and regulations will not have a material impact on our operations or financial condition 

 

as part of our overall business strategy we pursue acquisitions of and investments in complementary companies products and technologies in order to be successful in these activities we must among other things 

 

the benefits of any acquisition may prove to be less than anticipated and may not outweigh the costs reported in our financial statements completing any potential future acquisition could cause significant diversion of our management’s time and resources if we acquire new companies products or technologies we may be required to assume contingent liabilities or record impairment charges for goodwill and other intangible assets over time we cannot assure you that we will successfully overcome these risks or any other problems we encounter in connection with any acquisitions and any such acquisitions could adversely affect our business financial position or operating results 

 

our products and services are highly technical in nature in general only highly qualified and trained scientists have the necessary skills to develop and market our products and provide our services in addition some of our manufacturing positions are highly technical we face intense competition for these professionals from our competitors customers marketing partners and other companies throughout our industry we generally do not enter into employment agreements requiring these employees to continue in our employment for any period of time any failure on our part to hire train and retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel could seriously damage our business additionally if we were to lose a sufficient number of our research and development scientists and were unable to replace them or satisfy our needs for research and development through outsourcing it could adversely affect our business 

 

we have two classes of voting stock class a common stock and class b common stock with a few exceptions holders of class a and class b common stock vote as a single class when voting as a single class each share of class a common stock is entitled to onetenth of a vote while each share of class b common stock has one vote in the election or removal of directors the classes vote separately and the holders of class a common stock are entitled to elect 25 of the board of directors with holders of class b common stock electing the remaining directors 

as of february 22 2008 the schwartz family collectively held approximately 16 of our class a common stock and 89 of our class b common stock as a result the schwartz family is able to elect a majority of the directors effect fundamental changes in our direction and control matters affecting us including the allocation of business opportunities that may be suitable for our company in addition this concentration of ownership and voting power may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company 

the schwartz family may exercise its control over us according to interests that are different from other investors’ or debtors’ interests

 

the design and effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting may not prevent all errors misstatements or misrepresentations we cannot assure you that our disclosure controls and procedures over internal control of financial reporting will be effective in accomplishing all control objectives all of the time deficiencies particularly a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting which may occur in the future could result in misstatements of our results of operations restatements of our financial statements a decline in our stock price or otherwise materially adversely affect our business reputation results of operation financial condition or liquidity

  

we have significant manufacturing and distribution facilities located in southern and northern california california has experienced a number of earthquakes wildfires flooding landslides and other natural disasters in recent years the occurrences could damage or destroy our facilities which may result in interruptions to our business and losses that exceed our insurance coverage terrorist attacks such as those that occurred on september 11 2001 have contributed to economic instability in the united states and further acts of terrorism bioterrorism violence or war could affect the markets in which we operate our business operations our expectations and other forwardlooking statements contained or incorporated in this document any of these events could cause a decrease in our revenue earnings and cash flows

we may incur losses in future periods due to writedowns in the value of financial instruments 

we have positions in a variety of financial instruments including asset backed securities and other similar instruments financial markets are quite volatile and the markets for these securities can be illiquid the value of these securities will continue to be impacted by external market factors including default rates changes in the value of the underlying property such as residential or commercial real estate rating agency actions the prices at which observable market transactions occur and the financial strength of various entities such as financial guarantors who provide insurance for the securities should we need to liquidate these positions for cash our ability to sell these instruments without significant losses may also be limited by the market environment 

 

as of december 31 2007 we and our subsidiaries have approximately 4528 million of outstanding indebtedness in addition the indenture governing the notes permits us to incur additional debt provided we comply with the limitation on the incurrence of additional indebtedness and disqualified capital stock covenant contained in the indenture 

the following chart shows certain important credit statistics

 

the incurrence of substantial amounts of debt may have important consequences to you for instance it could 

 

our ability to satisfy our obligations and to reduce our total debt depends on our future operating performance and on economic financial competitive and other factors many of which are beyond our control our business may not generate sufficient cash flow and future financings may not be available to provide sufficient net proceeds to meet these obligations or to successfully execute our business strategy

 

the indenture governing our notes and the terms of other debt instruments including without limitation our credit facilities and other agreements we may enter in the future contain or will contain covenants imposing significant restrictions on our business these restrictions may affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise these covenants place restrictions on our ability to among other things 

 

our existing credit facility also requires that we meet certain financial tests and maintain certain financial ratios including a maximum consolidated leverage ratio test minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio test and a minimum net worth test 

our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control including prevailing economic financial and industry conditions the breach of any of these restrictions could result in a default an event of default under our debt agreements would permit some of our lenders to declare all amounts borrowed from them to be due and payable together with accrued and unpaid interest if we were unable to repay debt to our senior secured lenders these lenders could proceed against the collateral securing that debt in addition acceleration of our other indebtedness may cause us to be unable to make interest payments on our notes and repay the principal amount of the notes or may cause the future subsidiary guarantors if any to be unable to make payments under the guarantees

changes in internal control over financial reporting

there has been no change in our internal controls over financial reporting during our most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal controls over financial reporting

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting

the management of biorad laboratories inc is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in rule 13a15f under the securities and exchange act of 1934 as amended the “exchange act” our internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the preparation and fair presentation of our financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles

general

founded in 1952 and incorporated in 1957 biorad laboratories inc referred to in this report as “biorad” “we” “us” and “our” was initially engaged in the development and produc­tion of specialty chemicals used in biochemical pharmaceutical and other life science research applications in 1967 biorad entered the field of clinical diagnostics with the development of its first test kit based on separation techniques and materials developed for life science research biorad expanded into the field of analytical and measuring instrument systems through internal research and development efforts and acquisitions in the late 1970s and 1980s in 1999 biorad acquired the stock of pasteur sanofi diagnostics and the rights to certain ancillary assets this strengthened our position in the hiv and infectious disease diagnostic product market in 2000 and 2004 biorad divested its semiconductor optoelectronic metrology and confocal microscopy product lines

as biorad broadened its product lines it also expanded its geographical market biorad has distribution channels in over thirty countries outside the united states through subsidiaries whose primary focus is customer service and product distribution

biorad manufactures and supplies the life science research healthcare analytical chemistry and other markets with a broad range of products and systems used to separate complex chemical and biological materials and to identify analyze and purify their components

description of business 

business segments 

today biorad operates in two industry segments designated as life science and clinical diagnostics each operates in both the united states and international markets for a description of business and financial information on industry and geographic segments see note 15 on pages 28 through 31 of exhibit 131 which is incorporated herein by reference

life science segment

life science is the study of the characteristics behavior and structure of living organisms and their component systems life science researchers use a variety of products and systems including reagents instruments software and apparatus to advance the study of life processes drug discovery biotechnology and food pathogen testing primarily within a laboratory setting

we focus on selected segments of the life science market which we estimate to be approximately 4 billion the primary technological applications that we supply to these segments consist of electrophoresis image analysis molecular detection chromatography gene transfer sample preparation and amplification the primary endusers in our sectors of the market are universities and medical schools industrial research organizations government agencies pharmaceutical manufacturers biotechnology researchers and food testing laboratories

clinical diagnostics segment

the clinical diagnostics market encompasses a broad array of technologies incorporated into a variety of tests used to detect identify and quantify substances in blood or other body fluids and tissues the test results are used as aids for medical diagnosis detection evaluation monitoring and treatment of diseases and other medical conditions in humans the bulk of tests are performed in vitro “outside the body” while the remainder consist of in vivo “in the body” tests the most common type of in vitro tests are routine chemistry tests that measure important health parameters such as glucose cholesterol or sodium as part of routine blood checks other diagnostic tests are more specialized and require more sophisticated equipment and materials than do routine tests these specialized tests are typically lowervolume and higherpriced than routine tests we estimate the global clinical diagnostics market in which we participate to be approximately 10 billion

the primary endusers of clinical diagnostics are hospital laboratories reference laboratories physician office laboratories government agencies and other diagnostics manufacturers

raw materials and components 

we utilize a wide variety of chemicals biological materials electronic components machined metal parts optical parts minicomputers and peripheral devices most of these materials and components are available from numerous sources and we have not experienced difficulty in securing adequate supplies

patents and trademarks 

we own numerous us and international patents and patent licenses we believe however that our ability to develop and manufacture our products depends primarily on our knowledge technology and special skills we pay royalties on the sales of certain products under several patent license agreements we view these patents and license agreements as valuable assets

seasonal operations and backlog 

our business is not inherently seasonal however the european custom of concentrating vacation during the summer months usually tempers third quarter sales volume and operating income

for the most part we operate in markets characterized by short lead times and the absence of significant backlogs management has concluded that backlog information is not material to our business as a whole

sales and marketing 

each of biorads segments maintains a sales force to sell its products on a direct basis each sales force is technically trained in the disciplines associated with its products sales are also generated through direct mail advertising exhibits at trade shows and technical meetings telemarketing ecommerce and by extensive advertising in technical and trade publications sales and marketing efforts are augmented by technical service departments that assist customers in effective product utilization and in new product applications biorad also produces and distributes technical literature and holds seminars for customers on the use of its products

our customer base is broad and diversified in 2006 no single customer accounted for more than 2 of our total net sales our sales are affected by certain external factors for example a number of our customers particularly in the life science segment are substantially dependent on government grants and research contracts for their funding a significant reduction of government funding would have a detrimental effect on the results of this segment

most of our international sales are generated by whollyowned subsidiaries and their branch offices certain of these subsidiaries also have manufacturing facilities while biorads international operations are subject to certain risks common to foreign operations in general such as changes in governmental regulations import restrictions and foreign exchange fluctuations our international operations are principally in developed nations which we regard as presenting no significantly greater risks to its operations than are present in the united states

competition 

most markets served by our product groups are competitive our competitors range in size from startups to large multinational corporations reliable independent information on sales and market share of products produced by our competitors is not generally available we believe however based on our own marketing information that while some competitors are dominant with respect to certain individual products no one company including us is dominant with respect to a material portion of any segment of our business

because of the breadth of its product lines the life science segment does not face the same competitors for all of its products competitors in this market include ge biosciences invitrogen qiagen and applied biosystems applera we compete primarily based on meeting performance specifications

competitors in the clinical diagnostics segment range in size from small private companies to large multinational corporations we compete mainly in specific market niches and do not attempt to pursue the most competitive general diagnostics markets we compete based on our technological ability to provide customers with very specific tests and believe we are usually a significant competitor within our market niche competitors include abbott laboratories biomérieux ocd roche diagnostics tosoh inova diasorin and thermo fisher scientific

product research and development 

we conduct extensive product research and development activities in all areas of our business employing approximately 750 people worldwide in these activities research and development have played a major role in biorads growth and are expected to continue to do so in the future our research teams are continuously developing new products and new applications for existing products in our development and testing of new products and applications we consult with scientific and medical professionals at universities hospitals and medical schools and in industry excluding inprocess research and development we spent approximately 1234 million 1151 million and 1083 million on research and development activities during the years ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively

regulatory matters 

the manufacturing marketing and labeling of certain of our products primarily diagnostic products are subject to regulation in the united states by the center for devices and radiological health of the united states food and drug administration fda and in other jurisdictions by state and foreign government authorities fda regulations require that some new products have premarketing approval by the fda and require certain products to be manufactured in accordance with “good manufacturing practices” to be extensively tested and to be properly labeled to disclose test results and performance claims and limitations

as a multinational manufacturer and distributor of sophisticated instrumentation equipment we must meet a wide array of electromagnetic compatibility and safety compliance requirements to satisfy regulations in the united states the european community and other jurisdictions these requirements relating to testing and trials product licensing pricing and reimbursement vary widely among countries

our operations are subject to federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations that govern such activities as transportation of goods emissions to air and discharges to water as well as handling and disposal practices for solid hazardous and medical wastes in addition to environmental laws that regulate our operations we are also subject to environmental laws and regulations that create liabilities and cleanup responsibility for spills disposals or other releases of hazardous substances into the environment as a result of our operations or otherwise impacting real property that we own or operate the environmental laws and regulations also subject us to claims by third parties for damages resulting from any spills disposals or releases resulting from our operations or at any of our properties

risk factors 

tableend  

 

the life science and clinical diagnostics markets are each highly competitive some of our competitors have greater financial resources than we do and are less leveraged than we are making them better equipped to license technologies and intellectual property from third parties or to fund research and development manufacturing and marketing efforts moreover competitive and regulatory conditions in many markets in which we operate restrict our ability to fully recover through price increases higher costs of acquired goods and services resulting from inflation and other drivers of cost increases our competitors can be expected to continue to improve the design and performance of their products and to introduce new products with competitive price and performance characteristics although we believe that we have certain technological and other advantages over our competitors maintaining these advantages will require us to continue to invest in research and development sales and marketing and customer service and support we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient resources to continue to make such investments or that we will be successful in maintaining such advantages 

 

a significant portion of our sales are made outside of the united states our foreign subsidiaries generated 65 of our net sales in the year ended december 31 2006 our international operations are subject to risks common to foreign operations such as general economic and market conditions in the countries in which we operate changes in governmental regulations political instability import restrictions and currency exchange rate risks although we enter into forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge against future movements in foreign exchange rates that affect our intercompany receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies we cannot assure you that shifts in currency exchange rates especially significant strengthening of the us dollar compared to the euro will not have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

 

our customers include universities clinical diagnostics laboratories government agencies hospitals and pharmaceutical biotechnology and chemical companies the capital spending policies of these institutions and companies have a significant effect on the demand for our products such policies are based on a wide variety of factors including the resources available to make such purchases the availability of funding from grants by governments or government agencies the spending priorities among various types of equipment and the policies regarding capital expenditures during industry downturns or recessionary periods if government funding to our customers were to decrease or if our customers were to decrease or reallocate their budgets in a manner adverse to us our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

healthcare reform and the growth of managed care organizations have been and continue to be significant factors in the clinical diagnostics market the trend towards managed care together with efforts to reform the healthcare delivery system in the united states and europe has resulted in increased pressure on healthcare providers and other participants in the healthcare industry to reduce costs consolidation among healthcare providers has resulted in fewer more powerful groups whose purchasing power gives them cost containment leverage these competitive forces place constraints on the levels of overall pricing and thus could have a material adverse effect on our profit margins for products we sell in clinical diagnostics markets to the extent that the healthcare industry seeks to address the need to contain costs by limiting the number of clinical tests being performed our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected if these changes in the healthcare markets in the united states and europe continue we could be forced to alter our approach in selling marketing distributing and servicing our products 

 

a portion of our revenues and profits derive from the sale of our tests for bovine spongiform encephalopathy bse or “mad cow” disease we believe that there are multiple other competitors that offer bse tests approved by regulatory authorities in europe and japan further government subsidies have supported purchases by our customers of bse tests if governments in our key markets cease or substantially reduce the subsidies provided we may have to lower prices for or reduce sales of our bse tests finally if the threat to the world food supply from bse was materially reduced either through eradication of bse or otherwise sales of bse tests would materially decline if any of these events were to occur it could have a material negative impact on our financial condition or results of operations

 

our future success depends on our ability to continue to improve our product offerings and develop and introduce new product lines and extensions that integrate new technological advances if we are unable to integrate technological advances into our product offerings or to design develop manufacture and market new product lines and extensions successfully and in a timely manner our operating results will be adversely affected while we expect to continue to invest in research and development for all of our market segments we cannot assure you that our product and process development efforts will be successful or that new products we introduce will achieve market acceptance 

 

our information technology it systems are an integral part of our business and a serious disruption of our it systems could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations we depend on our it systems to process orders manage inventory and collect accounts receivable our it systems also allow us to efficiently purchase products from our suppliers and ship products to our customers on a timely basis maintain costeffective operations and provide customer service while we have contingency plans in place in case of an emergency we cannot assure you that the plans will allow us to operate at our current level of efficiency 

our ability to implement our business plan in a rapidly evolving market requires effective planning reporting and analytical processes we expect that we will need to continue to improve and further integrate our it systems reporting systems and operating procedures by training and educating our employees with respect to these improvements and integrations on an ongoing basis in order to effectively run our business if we fail to successfully manage and integrate our it reporting systems and operating procedures it could adversely affect our business or operating results 

 

we rely on a combination of copyright trade secret patent and trademark laws and thirdparty nondisclosure agreements to protect our intellectual property rights and products however we cannot assure you that our intellectual property rights will not be challenged invalidated circumvented or rendered unenforceable or that meaningful protection or adequate remedies will be available to us for instance it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy our intellectual property to reverse engineer or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary or to develop equivalent technologies independently additionally third parties may assert patent copyright and other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to us if we are unable to license or otherwise access protected technology used in our products or if we lose our rights under any existing licenses we could be prohibited from manufacturing and marketing such products we may find it necessary to enforce our patents or other intellectual property rights or to defend ourselves against claimed infringement of the rights of others through litigation which could result in substantial costs to us and divert our resources we also could incur substantial costs to redesign our products to defend any legal action taken against us or to pay damages to an infringed party the foregoing matters could adversely impact our business 

 

some of our products primarily diagnostic products production processes and marketing are subject to federal state local and foreign regulation including the fda and its foreign counterparts we are also subject to government regulation of the use and handling of a number of materials and controlled substances failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in substantial liability to us suspension or cessation of our operations restrictions on our ability to expand at our present locations or require us to make significant capital expenditures or incur other significant expenses 

 

our operations are subject to federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations that govern such activities as transportation of goods emissions to air and discharges to water as well as handling and disposal practices for solid hazardous and medical wastes in addition to environmental laws that regulate our operations we are also subject to environmental laws and regulations that create liability and cleanup responsibility for spills disposals or other releases of hazardous substances into the environment as a result of our operations or otherwise impacting real property that we own or operate the environmental laws and regulations also subject us to claims by third parties for damages resulting from any spills disposals or releases resulting from our operations or at any of our properties 

we will in the future incur capital and operating costs to comply with currently existing laws and regulations and possible new statutory enactments and these expenditures may be significant we have incurred and may in the future incur fines related to environmental matters and liability for costs or damages related to spills or other releases of hazardous substances into the environment at sites where we have operated or at offsite locations where we have sent hazardous substances for disposal in that regard we currently are investigating soil and groundwater contamination at one of our properties under the oversight of a state agency based on the currently available information we believe that the costs to clean up this contamination will not have a material adverse effect on the future results of our operations or our financial condition we can provide no assurance however that such matters or any future obligations to comply with environmental laws and regulations will not have a material impact on our operations or financial condition 

 

as part of our overall business strategy we pursue acquisitions of and investments in complementary companies products and technologies in order to be successful in these activities we must among other things 

 

the benefits of any acquisition may prove to be less than anticipated and may not outweigh the costs reported in our financial statements completing any potential future acquisition could cause significant diversion of our management’s time and resources if we acquire new companies products or technologies we may be required to assume contingent liabilities and record impairment charges for goodwill and other intangible assets over time we cannot assure you that we will successfully overcome these risks or any other problems we encounter in connection with any acquisitions and any such acquisitions could adversely affect our business financial position or operating results 

 

our products and services are highly technical in nature in general only highly qualified and trained scientists have the necessary skills to develop and market our products and provide our services in addition some of our manufacturing positions are highly technical we face intense competition for these professionals from our competitors customers marketing partners and other companies throughout our industry we generally do not enter into employment agreements requiring these employees to continue in our employment for any period of time any failure on our part to hire train and retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel could seriously damage our business additionally if we were to lose a sufficient number of our research and development scientists and were unable to replace them or satisfy our needs for research and development through outsourcing it could adversely affect our business 

 

we have two classes of voting stock class a common stock and class b common stock with a few exceptions holders of class a and class b common stock vote as a single class when voting as a single class each share of class a common stock is entitled to onetenth of a vote while each share of class b common stock has one vote in the election or removal of directors the classes vote separately and the holders of class a common stock are entitled to elect 25 of the board of directors with holders of class b common stock electing the remaining directors 

as of february 15 2007 the schwartz family collectively held approximately 17 of our class a common stock and 89 of our class b common stock as a result the schwartz family is able to elect a majority of the directors effect fundamental changes in our direction and control matters affecting us including the allocation of business opportunities that may be suitable for our company in addition this concentration of ownership and voting power may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company 

the schwartz family may exercise its control over us according to interests that are different from other investors’ or debtors’ interests

 

the design and effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting may not prevent all errors misstatements or misrepresentations while management continues to review the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting we cannot assure you that our disclosure controls and procedures over internal control of financial reporting will be effective in accomplishing all control objectives all of the time deficiencies particularly a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting which may occur in the future could result in misstatements of our results of operations restatements of our financial statements a decline in our stock price or otherwise materially adversely affect our business reputation results of operation financial condition or liquidity

  

terrorist attacks such as those that occurred on september 11 2001 have contributed to economic instability in the united states and further acts of terrorism bioterrorism violence or war could affect the markets in which we operate our business operations our expectations and other forwardlooking statements contained or incorporated in this document 

the threat of terrorist attacks in the united states since september 11 2001 continues to create many economic and political uncertainties the potential for future terrorist attacks the united states and international responses to terrorist attacks and other acts of war or hostility including the war in iraq may cause greater uncertainty and cause our business to suffer in ways that we cannot currently predict events such as those referred to above could cause or contribute to a general decline in investment valuations which in turn could reduce the market value of your investment in addition terrorist attacks particularly acts of bioterrorism that directly impact our physical facilities or those of our suppliers or customers could have an impact on our sales supply chain production capability and costs and our ability to deliver our products to our customers 

 

as of december 31 2006 we and our subsidiaries have approximately 4261 million of outstanding indebtedness in addition the indenture governing the notes permits us to incur additional debt provided we comply with the limitation on the incurrence of additional indebtedness and disqualified capital stock covenant contained in the indenture 

the following chart shows certain important credit statistics and is presented as of december 31 2006 

 

the incurrence of substantial amounts of debt may have important consequences to you for instance it could 

 

our ability to satisfy our obligations and to reduce our total debt depends on our future operating performance and on economic financial competitive and other factors many of which are beyond our control our business may not generate sufficient cash flow and future financings may not be available to provide sufficient net proceeds to meet these obligations or to successfully execute our business strategy

 

the indenture governing our notes and the terms of other debt instruments including without limitation our credit facilities and other agreements we may enter in the future contain or will contain covenants imposing significant restrictions on our business these restrictions may affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise these covenants place restrictions on our ability to among other things 

 

our existing credit facility also requires that we meet certain financial tests and maintain certain financial ratios including a maximum consolidated leverage ratio test minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio test and a minimum net worth test 

our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control including prevailing economic financial and industry conditions the breach of any of these restrictions could result in a default an event of default under our debt agreements would permit some of our lenders to declare all amounts borrowed from them to be due and payable together with accrued and unpaid interest if we were unable to repay debt to our senior secured lenders these lenders could proceed against the collateral securing that debt in addition acceleration of our other indebtedness may cause us to be unable to make interest payments on our notes and repay the principal amount of the notes or may cause the future subsidiary guarantors if any to be unable to make payments under the guarantees

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures

as of the end of the period covered by this report biorad carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures based upon that evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that material information relating to biorad is made known to management including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer

changes in internal control over financial reporting

there has been no change in our internal controls over financial reporting during our most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal controls over financial reporting

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting

the management of biorad laboratories is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in rule 13a15f under the securities and exchange act of 1934 as amended the “exchange act” our internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the preparation and fair presentation of our financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles

an internal control system over financial reporting has inherent limitations and may not prevent or detect misstatements therefore even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation

management has used the framework set forth in the report entitled “internal control – integrated framework” published by the committee of sponsoring organizations coso of the treadway commission to evaluate the effectiveness of biorad’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2006 management has concluded our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 2006 biorad’s independent auditor deloitte  touche llp has issued an attestation report on management’s assessment of biorad’s internal control over financial reporting

report of independent registered public accounting firm 

board of directors and stockholders biorad laboratories inc

hercules california

we have audited managements assessment included in the accompanying management’s report on internal control over financial reporting that biorad laboratories inc and subsidiaries the “company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2006 based on criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on managements assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting evaluating managements assessment testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions 

a companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of the companys principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions and effected by the companys board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements

because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis also projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

in our opinion managements assessment that the company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2006 is fairly stated in all material respects based on the criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission also in our opinion the company maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2006 based on the criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission

we have also audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule as of and for the year ended december 31 2006 of the company and our reports dated february 28 2007 expressed unqualified opinions on those financial statements and financial statement schedule and included an explanatory paragraph concerning the adoption of a new accounting standard in 2006

general

incorporated in 1957 biorad laboratories inc referred to in this report as “biorad” “we” “us” and “our” was initially engaged in the development and produc­tion of specialty chemicals used in biochemical pharmaceutical and other life science research applications in 1967 biorad entered the field of clinical diagnostics with the develop­ment of its first test kit based on separation techniques and materials developed for life science research recognizing that the fields of clinical diagnostics and life science research were evolving toward more automated techniques biorad expanded into the field of analytical and measuring instrument systems through internal research and development efforts and acquisitions in the late 1970s and 1980s

as biorad broadened its product lines it also expanded its geographical market biorad has distribution chan­nels in over thirty countries outside the united states through subsidiaries whose primary focus is customer service and product distribution

on october 1 1999 biorad acquired the stock of pasteur sanofi diagnostics psd and the rights to certain ancillary assets for 210 million psd was founded by the institut pasteur to commercialize its diagnostic research and held certain exclusive licenses from the institut pasteur in the hiv and infectious disease diagnostic product market psd also expanded the geographic reach and market penetration for our products particularly in latin america africa and france

biorad manufactures and supplies the life science research healthcare analytical chemistry and other markets with a broad range of products and systems used to separate complex chemical and biological materials and to identify analyze and purify their components

description of business 

business segments 

biorad operates in two industry segments designated as life science and clinical diagnostics each operates in both the united states and international markets for a description of business and financial information on industry and geographic segments see note 15 on pages 30 through 33 of exhibit 131 which is incorporated herein by reference

life science segment

life science is the study of the characteristics behavior and structure of living organisms and their component systems life science researchers use a variety of products and systems including reagents instruments software and apparatus to advance the study of life processes drug discovery biotechnology and food pathogen testing primarily within a laboratory setting

we focus on selected segments of the life science market all dealing with functional genomics and proteomics and which we estimate 2005 worldwide sales totaled approximately 4 billion the primary technological applications that we supply to these segments consist of electrophoresis image analysis molecular detection chromatography gene transfer sample preparation and amplification the primary endusers in our sectors of the market are universities and medical schools industrial research organizations government agencies pharmaceutical manufacturers biotechnology researchers and food testing laboratories

clinical diagnostics segment

the clinical diagnostics industry encompasses a broad array of technologies incorporated into a variety of tests used to detect identify and quantify substances in blood or other bodily fluids and tissues the test results are used as aids for medical diagnosis detection evaluation monitoring and treatment of diseases and other medical conditions the bulk of tests are performed in vitro outside the body while the remainder consist of in vivo in the body tests the most common type of in vitro tests are routine chemistry tests that measure important health parameters such as glucose cholesterol or sodium as part of routine blood checks other diagnostic tests are more specialized and require more sophisticated equipment and materials than do routine tests these specialized tests are typically lowervolume and higherpriced than routine tests we estimate that in 2005 the global clinical diagnostics market totaled approximately 280 billion

the primary endusers in the areas of the clinical diagnostics industry we target are hospital laboratories reference laboratories physician office laboratories government agencies and other diagnostics manufacturers

raw materials and components 

we utilize a wide variety of chemicals biological materials electronic components machined metal parts optical parts minicomputers and peripheral devices most of these materials and components are available from numerous sources and we have not experienced difficulty in securing adequate supplies

we own numerous us and international patents and patent licenses we believe however that our ability to develop and manufacture our products depends primarily on our knowledge technology and special skills we pay royalties on the sales of certain products under several patent license agreements we view these patents and license agreements as valuable assets

seasonal operations and backlog 

our business is not inherently seasonal however the european custom of concentrating vacation during the summer months usually tempers third quarter sales volume and operating income

for the most part we operate in markets characterized by short lead times and the absence of significant backlogs management has concluded that backlog information is not material to our business as a whole

sales and marketing 

each of biorads segments maintains a sales force to sell its products on a direct basis each sales force is technically trained in the disciplines associated with its products sales are also generated through direct mail advertising exhibits at trade shows and technical meetings telemarketing ecommerce and by extensive advertising in technical and trade publications sales and marketing efforts are augmented by technical service departments that assist customers in effective product utilization and in new product applications biorad also produces and distributes technical literature and holds seminars for customers on the use of its products

our customer base is broad and diversified in 2005 no single customer accounted for more than 2 of our total net sales our sales are affected by certain external factors for example a number of our customers particularly in the life science segment are substantially dependent on government grants and research contracts for their funding a significant reduction of government funding would have a detrimental effect on the results of this segment

biorad is the leading provider of bse bovine spongiform encephalopathy or mad cow tests throughout the world revenues from the sales of bse testing products within our life science segment was less than 10 of consolidated net revenue in 2005 in 2004 the bse revenue was approximately 11 of consolidated net revenue a large portion of the revenue for this product is driven by government agencies currently mandating the use of the test competition pricing changes in test standards technology or a decrease in testing demand could negatively impact our future revenue from this product 

most of our international sales are generated by whollyowned subsidiaries and their branch offices certain of these subsidiaries also have manufacturing facilities while biorads international operations are subject to certain risks common to foreign operations in general such as changes in governmental regulations import restrictions and foreign exchange fluctuations our international operations are principally in developed nations which we regard as presenting no significantly greater risks to its operations than are present in the united states

competition 

most markets served by our product groups are competitive our competitors range in size from startups to large multinational corporations reliable independent information on sales and market share of products produced by our competitors is not generally available we believe however based on our own marketing information that while some competitors are dominant with respect to certain individual products no one company including us is dominant with respect to a material portion of any segment of our business

because of the breadth of its product lines life science does not face the same competitor for all of its products competitors in this market include ge biosciences invitrogen qiagen and applied biosystems applera we compete primarily based on meeting performance specifications

competitors in the clinical diagnostics segment range in size from small private companies to large multinational corporations we compete mainly in specific market niches and do not attempt to pursue the most competitive general diagnostics markets we compete based on our technological ability to provide customers with very specific tests and believe we are usually a significant competitor within our market niche competitors include abbott laboratories biomerieux inc roche diagnostics tosoh inova diasorin and fishermas

product research and development 

we conduct extensive product research and development activities in all areas of our business employing approximately 700 people worldwide in these activities research and development have played a major role in biorads growth and are expected to continue to do so in the future our research teams are continuously developing new products and new applications for existing products in our development and testing of new products and applications we consult with scientific and medical professionals at universities hospitals and medical schools and in industry excluding inprocess research and development we spent approximately 1151 million 1083 million and 913 million on research and development activities during the years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively

regulatory matters 

the manufacturing marketing and labeling of certain of our products primarily diagnostic products are subject to regulation in the united states by the center for devices and radiological health of the united states food and drug administration fda and in other jurisdictions by state and foreign government authorities fda regulations require that some new products have premarketing approval by the fda and require certain products to be manufactured in accordance with good manufacturing practices to be extensively tested and to be properly labeled to disclose test results and performance claims and limitations

as a multinational manufacturer and distributor of sophisticated instrumentation equipment we must meet a wide array of electromagnetic compatibility and safety compliance requirements to satisfy regulations in the united states the european community and other jurisdictions these requirements relating to testing and trials product licensing pricing and reimbursement vary widely among countries

our operations are subject to federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations that govern such activities as transportation of goods emissions to air and discharges to water as well as handling and disposal practices for solid hazardous and medical wastes in addition to environmental laws that regulate our operations we are also subject to environmental laws and regulations that create liabilities and cleanup responsibility for spills disposals or other releases of hazardous substances into the environment as a result of our operations or otherwise impacting real property that we own or operate the environmental laws and regulations also subject us to claims by third parties for damages resulting from any spills disposals or releases resulting from our operations or at any of our properties 

employees 

at january 31 2006 biorad had approximately 5200 fulltime employees fewer than 9 of biorads approximately 2600 u s employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement which will expire on november 7 2006 many of biorads nonus fulltime employees especially in france are covered by collective bargaining agreements biorad considers its employee relations in general to be good

 item 1a 

risk factors 

tableend  

the industries and market segments in which we operate are highly competitive and we may not be able to compete effectively with larger companies with greater financial resources than we have 

 

the life science and clinical diagnostics markets are each highly competitive some of our competitors have greater financial resources than we do and are less leveraged than we are making them better equipped to license technologies and intellectual property from third parties or to fund research and development manufacturing and marketing efforts moreover competitive and regulatory conditions in many markets in which we operate restrict our ability to fully recover through price increases higher costs of acquired goods and services resulting from inflation and other drivers of cost increases our competitors can be expected to continue to improve the design and performance of their products and to introduce new products with competitive price and performance characteristics although we believe that we have certain technological and other advantages over our competitors maintaining these advantages will require us to continue to invest in research and development sales and marketing and customer service and support we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient resources to continue to make such investments or that we will be successful in maintaining such advantages 

 

we have significant international operations which subject us to various foreign risks such as general economic and market conditions in the countries in which we operate 

 

a significant portion of our sales are made outside of the united states our foreign subsidiaries generated 64 of our net sales in the year ended december 31 2005 our international operations are subject to risks common to foreign operations such as general economic and market conditions in the countries in which we operate changes in governmental regulations political instability import restrictions and currency exchange rate risks although we enter into forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge against future movements in foreign exchange rates that affect our intercompany receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies we cannot assure you that shifts in currency exchange rates especially significant strengthening of the us dollar compared to the euro will not have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

 

we are dependent on government funding and the capital spending policies of our customers and the effect of potential healthcare reform on government funding and our customers’ ability to purchase our products is uncertain  

 

our customers include universities clinical diagnostics laboratories government agencies hospitals and pharmaceutical biotechnology and chemical companies the capital spending policies of these institutions and companies have a significant effect on the demand for our products such policies are based on a wide variety of factors including the resources available to make such purchases the availability of funding from grants by governments or government agencies the spending priorities among various types of equipment and the policies regarding capital expenditures during industry downturns or recessionary periods if government funding to our customers were to decrease or if our customers were to decrease or reallocate their capital spending budgets in a manner adverse to us our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

 

healthcare reform and the growth of managed care organizations have been and continue to be significant factors in the clinical diagnostics market the trend towards managed care together with efforts to reform the healthcare delivery system in the us and europe has resulted in increased pressure on healthcare providers and other participants in the healthcare industry to reduce costs consolidation among healthcare providers has resulted in fewer more powerful groups whose purchasing power gives them cost containment leverage these competitive forces place constraints on the levels of overall pricing and thus could have a material adverse effect on our profit margins for products we sell in clinical diagnostics markets to the extent that the healthcare industry seeks to address the need to contain costs by limiting the number of clinical tests being performed our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected if these changes in the united states and european healthcare markets continue we could be forced to alter our approach in selling marketing distributing and servicing our products 

 

we derive a portion of our profits from our tests for “mad cow” disease 

 

a portion of our revenues and profits derive from the sale of our tests for bovine spongiform encephalopathy “bse” or “mad cow” disease we believe that there are multiple other competitors that offer bse tests approved by regulatory authorities in europe and japan however our bse tests have limited patent protection further government subsidies have supported purchases by our customers of bse tests if governments in our key markets cease or substantially reduce the subsidies provided we may have to lower prices for or reduce sales of our bse tests finally if the threat to the world food supply from bse was materially reduced either through eradication of bse or otherwise sales of bse tests would materially decline if any of these events were to occur it could have a material negative impact on our financial condition or results of operations

 

our failure to improve our product offerings and develop and introduce new products may negatively impact our business 

 

our future success depends on our ability to continue to improve our product offerings and develop and introduce new product lines and extensions that integrate new technological advances if we are unable to integrate technological advances into our product offerings or to design develop manufacture and market new product lines and extensions successfully and in a timely manner our operating results will be adversely affected while we expect to continue to invest in research and development for all of our market segments we cannot assure you that our product and process development efforts will be successful or that new products we introduce will achieve market acceptance 

 

if we experience a disruption of our information technology systems or if we fail to successfully manage and integrate our information technology and reporting systems it could harm our business 

 

our information technology “it” systems are an integral part of our business and a serious disruption of our it systems could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations we depend on our it systems to process orders manage inventory and collect accounts receivable our it systems also allow us to efficiently purchase products from our suppliers and ship products to our customers on a timely basis maintain costeffective operations and provide customer service while we have contingency plans in place in case of an emergency we cannot assure you that the plans will allow us to operate at our current level of efficiency 

 

our ability to implement our business plan in a rapidly evolving market requires an effective planning reporting and management process we expect that we will need to continue to improve and further integrate our it systems reporting systems and procedures and train and educate our employees with respect to these improvements and integrations on an ongoing basis in order to effectively run our business if we fail to successfully manage and integrate our it and reporting systems it could adversely affect our business or operating results 

 

risks relating to intellectual property rights may negatively impact our business  

 

we rely on a combination of copyright trade secret patent and trademark laws and thirdparty nondisclosure agreements to protect our intellectual property rights and products however we cannot assure you that our intellectual property rights will not be challenged invalidated circumvented or rendered unenforceable or that meaningful protection or adequate remedies will be available to us for instance it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy our intellectual property to reverse engineer or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary or to develop equivalent technologies independently additionally third parties may assert exclusive patent copyright and other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to us if we are unable to license or otherwise access protected technology used in our products or if we lose our rights under any existing licenses we could be prohibited from manufacturing and marketing such products we may find it necessary to enforce our patents or other intellectual property rights or to defend ourselves against claimed infringement of the rights of others through litigation which could result in substantial costs to us and divert our resources we also could incur substantial costs to redesign our products to defend any legal action taken against us or to pay damages to an infringed party the foregoing matters could adversely impact our business 

 

we are subject to substantial government regulation 

 

some of our products primarily diagnostic products production processes and our marketing are subject to federal state local and foreign regulation including the us food and drug administration “fda” and its foreign counterparts we are also subject to government regulation of the use and handling of a number of materials and controlled substances failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in substantial liability to us suspension or cessation of our operations restrictions on our ability to expand at our present locations or require us to make significant capital expenditures or incur other significant expenses 

 

we are currently subject to environmental regulations and enforcement proceedings  

 

our operations are subject to federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations that govern such activities as transportation of goods emissions to air and discharges to water as well as handling and disposal practices for solid hazardous and medical wastes in addition to environmental laws that regulate our operations we are also subject to environmental laws and regulations that create liability and cleanup responsibility for spills disposals or other releases of hazardous substances into the environment as a result of our operations or otherwise impacting real property that we own or operate the environmental laws and regulations also subject us to claims by third parties for damages resulting from any spills disposals or releases resulting from our operations or at any of our properties 

 

we will in the future incur capital and operating costs to comply with currently existing laws and regulations and possible new statutory enactments and these expenditures may be significant we have incurred and may in the future incur fines related to environmental matters and liability for costs or damages related to spills or other releases of hazardous substances into the environment at sites where we have operated or at offsite locations where we have sent hazardous substances for disposal in that regard we currently are investigating soil and groundwater contamination at one of our properties under the oversight of a state agency based on the currently available information we believe that the costs to clean up this contamination will not have a material adverse effect on the future results of our operations or our financial condition we can provide no assurance however that such matters or any future obligations to comply with environmental laws and regulations will not have a material impact on our operations or financial condition 

 

we cannot assure you that we will be able to integrate acquired companies products or technologies into our company successfully 

 

as part of our overall business strategy we pursue acquisitions of and investments in complementary companies products and technologies in order to be successful in these activities we must among other things 

 

•

assimilate the operations and personnel of acquired companies 

 

•

minimize potential disruption to our ongoing business 

 

•

retain key technical and management personnel 

 

•

integrate acquired companies into our strategic and financial plans 

 

•

accurately assess the value of target companies products and technologies 

 

•

harmonize standards controls procedures and policies and 

 

•

minimize the impact to our relationships with our employees and customers 

 

the benefits of any acquisition may prove to be less than anticipated and may not outweigh the costs reported in our financial statements completing any potential future acquisition could cause significant diversion of our management’s time and resources if we acquire new companies products or technologies we may be required to assume contingent liabilities and record impairment charges for goodwill and other intangible assets over time we cannot assure you that we will successfully overcome these risks or any other problems we encounter in connection with any acquisitions and any such acquisitions could adversely affect our business financial position or operating results 

 

loss of key personnel could hurt our business 

 

our products and services are highly technical in nature in general only highly qualified and trained scientists have the necessary skills to develop and market our products and provide our services in addition some of our manufacturing positions are highly technical we face intense competition for these professionals from our competitors customers marketing partners and other companies throughout our industry we generally do not enter into employment agreements requiring these employees to continue in our employment for any period of time any failure on our part to hire train and retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel could seriously damage our business additionally if we were to lose a sufficient number of our research and development scientists and were unable to replace them or satisfy our needs for research and development through outsourcing it could adversely affect our business 

  

a significant majority of our voting stock is held by the schwartz family which could lead to conflicts of interest 

 

we have two classes of voting stock class a common stock and class b common stock with a few exceptions holders of class a and class b common stock vote as a single class when voting as a single class each share of class a common stock is entitled to onetenth of a vote while each share of class b common stock has one vote in the election or removal of directors the classes vote separately and the holders of class a common stock are entitled to elect 25 of the board of directors with holders of class b common stock electing the remaining directors 

 

as of february 15 2006 the schwartz family collectively held approximately 17 of our class a common stock and 89 of our class b common stock as a result the schwartz family is able to elect a majority of the directors effect fundamental changes in our direction and control matters affecting us including the allocation of business opportunities that may be suitable for our company in addition this concentration of ownership and voting power may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company 

 

the schwartz family may exercise its control over us according to interests that are different from other investors’ or debtors’ interests

 

our business could be adversely impacted if we have deficiencies in our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting 

the design and effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting may not prevent all errors misstatements or misrepresentations while management continues to review the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting we can not assure you that our disclosure controls and procedures over internal control of financial reporting will be effective in accomplishing all control objectives all of the time deficiencies particularly a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting which may occur in the future could result in misstatements of our results of operations restatements of our financial statements a decline in our stock price or otherwise materially adversely affect our business reputation results of operation financial condition or liquidity

terrorist attacks or acts of war may cause damage or disruption to us and our employees facilities information systems security systems vendors and customers which could significantly impact our net sales costs and expenses and financial condition 

 

terrorist attacks such as those that occurred on september 11 2001 have contributed to economic instability in the united states and further acts of terrorism bioterrorism violence or war could affect the markets in which we operate our business operations our expectations and other forwardlooking statements contained or incorporated in this document 

 

the threat of terrorist attacks in the united states since september 11 2001 continues to create many economic and political uncertainties the potential for future terrorist attacks the united states and international responses to terrorist attacks and other acts of war or hostility including the war in iraq may cause greater uncertainty and cause our business to suffer in ways that we cannot currently predict events such as those referred to above could cause or contribute to a general decline in investment valuations which in turn could reduce the market value of your investment in addition terrorist attacks particularly acts of bioterrorism that directly impact our physical facilities or those of our suppliers or customers could have an impact on our sales supply chain production capability and costs and our ability to deliver our products to our customers 

 

we have substantial debt and have the ability to incur additional debt the principal and interest payment obligations of such debt may restrict our future operations and impair our ability to meet our obligations under the notes 

 

as of december 31 2005 we and our subsidiaries have approximately 4261 million of outstanding indebtedness in addition the indenture governing the notes permits us to incur additional debt provided we comply with the limitation on the incurrence of additional indebtedness and disqualified capital stock covenant contained in the indenture 

 

the following chart shows certain important credit statistics and is presented as of december 31 2005 

 

  

the incurrence of substantial amounts of debt may have important consequences to you for instance it could 

 

•

make it more difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations including those relating to the notes 

 

•

require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of interest and principal due under our debt including the notes which will reduce funds available for other business purposes 

 

•

increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions 

 

•

limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the industries in which we operate 

 

•

place us at a competitive disadvantage compared with some of our competitors that have less debt and 

 

•

limit our ability to obtain additional financing required to fund working capital and capital expenditures and for other general corporate purposes 

 

our ability to satisfy our obligations and to reduce our total debt depends on our future operating performance and on economic financial competitive and other factors many of which are beyond our control our business may not generate sufficient cash flow and future financings may not be available to provide sufficient net proceeds to meet these obligations or to successfully execute our business strategy 

 

the agreements governing our debt impose restrictions on our business 

 

the indenture governing our notes and the terms of other debt instruments including without limitation our credit facilities and other agreements we may enter in the future contain or will contain covenants imposing significant restrictions on our business these restrictions may affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise these covenants place restrictions on our ability to among other things 

 

•

incur additional debt 

 

•

create liens 

 

•

make investments 

 

•

enter into transactions with affiliates 

 

•

sell assets 

 

•

in the case of some of our subsidiaries guarantee debt 

 

•

declare or pay dividends redeem stock or make other distributions to shareholders and 

 

•

consolidate or merge 

 

our existing credit facility also requires that we meet certain financial tests and maintain certain financial ratios including a maximum consolidated leverage ratio test minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio test and a minimum net worth test 

 

our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control including prevailing economic financial and industry conditions the breach of any of these restrictions could result in a default an event of default under our debt agreements would permit some of our lenders to declare all amounts borrowed from them to be due and payable together with accrued and unpaid interest if we were unable to repay debt to our senior secured lenders these lenders could proceed against the collateral securing that debt in addition acceleration of our other indebtedness may cause us to be unable to make interest payments on our notes and repay the principal amount of the notes or may cause the future subsidiary guarantors if any to be unable to make payments under the guarantees

changes in internal control over financial reporting

there has been no change in our internal controls over financial reporting during our most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal controls over financial reporting

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting

the management of biorad laboratories is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in rule 13a15f under the securities and exchange act of 1934 as amended the exchange act our internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the preparation and fair presentation of our financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles

an internal control system over financial reporting has inherent limitations and may not prevent or detect misstatements therefore even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation

management has used the framework set forth in the report entitled internal control – integrated framework published by the committee of sponsoring organizations coso of the treadway commission to evaluate the effectiveness of biorad’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2005 management has concluded our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 2005 biorad’s independent auditor deloitte  touche llp has issued an attestation report on management’s assessment of biorad’s internal control over financial reporting

report of independent registered public accounting firm on 

internal control over financial reporting 

board of directors and stockholders

biorad laboratories inc hercules california

we have audited managements assessment included in the accompanying management’s report on internal control over financial reporting that biorad laboratories inc and subsidiaries the “company” maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2005 based on criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on managements assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting evaluating managements assessment testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions

a companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of the companys principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions and effected by the companys board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements

because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis also projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

in our opinion managements assessment that the company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2005 is fairly stated in all material respects based on the criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission also in our opinion the company maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2005 based on the criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission

we have also audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule as of and for the year ended december 31 2005 of the company and our report dated march 2 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial statement schedule

 item 1 business 

general 

founded in 1957 biorad laboratories inc biorad or the company was initially engaged in the development and produc­tion of specialty chemicals used in biochemical pharmaceutical and other life science research applications in 1967 the com­pany entered the field of clinical diagnostics with the develop­ment of its first test kit based on separation techniques and materials developed for life science research recognizing that the fields of clinical diagnostics and life science research were evolving toward more automated techniques biorad expanded into the field of analytical and measuring instrument systems through internal research and development efforts and acquisitions in the late 1970s and 1980s

as biorad broadened its product lines it also expanded its geographical market the company has distribution chan­nels in over thirty countries outside the united states through subsidiaries whose primary focus is customer service and product distribution

on october 1 1999 biorad acquired the stock of pasteur sanofi diagnostics psd and the rights to certain ancillary assets for 210 million psd was founded by the institut pasteur to commercialize its diagnostic research and held certain exclusive licenses from the institut pasteur in the hiv and infectious disease diagnostic product market psd also expanded the geographic reach and market penetration for the companys products particularly in latin america africa and france

description of business 

business segments 

the company operates in two industry segments designated as life science and clinical diagnostics each operates in both the united states and international markets for a description of business and financial information on industry and geographic segments see note 15 on pages 29 through 32 of exhibit 131 which is incorporated herein by reference 

life science segment

life science is the study of the characteristics behavior and structure of living organisms and their component systems life science researchers use a variety of products and systems including reagents instruments software and apparatus to advance the study of life processes drug discovery biotechnology and food pathogen testing primarily within a laboratory setting

we focus on selected segments of the life science market all dealing with functional genomics and proteomics and which we estimate 2004 worldwide sales totaled approximately 4 billion the primary technological applications that we supply to these segments consist of electrophoresis image analysis molecular detection chromatography gene transfer sample preparation and amplification the primary endusers in our sectors of the market are universities and medical schools industrial research organizations government agencies pharmaceutical manufacturers biotechnology researchers and food testing laboratories

clinical diagnostics segment

the clinical diagnostics industry encompasses a broad array of technologies incorporated into a variety of tests used to detect identify and quantify substances in blood or other bodily fluids and tissues the test results are used as aids for medical diagnosis detection evaluation monitoring and treatment of diseases and other medical conditions the bulk of tests are performed in vitro outside the body while the remainder consist of in vivo in the body tests the most common type of in vitro tests are routine chemistry tests that measure important health parameters such as glucose cholesterol or sodium as part of routine blood checks other diagnostic tests are more specialized and require more sophisticated equipment and materials than do routine tests these specialized tests are typically lowervolume and higherpriced than routine tests we estimate that in 2004 the global clinical diagnostics market totaled approximately 240 billion

the primary endusers in the areas of the clinical diagnostics industry we target are hospital laboratories reference laboratories physician office laboratories government agencies and other diagnostics manufacturers

raw materials and components 

the company utilizes a wide variety of chemicals biological materials electronic components machined metal parts optical parts minicomputers and peripheral devices most of these materials and components are available from numerous sources and the company has not experienced difficulty in securing adequate 

supplies

patents and trademarks 

we own numerous us and international patents and patent licenses we believe however that our ability to develop and manufacture our products depends primarily on our knowledge technology and special skills under several patent license agreements we pay royalties on the sales of certain products we view these patents and license agreements as valuable assets

seasonal operations and backlog 

the companys business is not inherently seasonal however the european custom of concentrating vacation during the summer months usually tempers third quarter sales volume and operating income

for the most part the company operates in markets characterized by short lead times and the absence of significant backlogs management has concluded that backlog information is not material to the companys business as a whole

sales and marketing 

each of biorads segments maintains a sales force to sell its products on a direct basis each sales force is technically trained in the disciplines associated with its products sales are also generated through direct mail advertising exhibits at trade shows and technical meetings telemarketing ecommerce and by extensive advertising in technical and trade publications sales and marketing efforts are augmented by technical service departments that assist customers in effective product utilization and in new product applications biorad also produces and distributes technical literature and holds seminars for customers on the use of its products 

our customer base is broad and diversified in 2004 no single customer accounted for more than 2 of our total net sales our sales are affected by certain external factors for example a number of our customers particularly in the life science segment are substantially dependent on government grants and research contracts for their funding a significant reduction of government funding would have a detrimental effect on the results of this segment

the company is the leading provider of bse bovine spongiform encephalopathy or mad cow tests throughout the world revenues from the sales of testing products for bse within our life science segment represented approximately 11 of consolidated net revenue in 2004 and 2003 a large portion of the revenue for this product is from government agencies currently mandating the use of the test competition pricing changes in test standards technology or a decrease in government demand could negatively impact the companys future revenue from this product 

most of the companys international sales are generated by whollyowned subsidiaries and their branch offices certain of these subsidiaries also have manufacturing facilities while biorads international operations are subject to certain risks common to foreign operations in general such as changes in governmental regulations import restrictions and foreign exchange fluctuations the companys international operations are principally in developed nations which the company regards as presenting no significantly greater risks to its operations than are present in the united states

competition 

most markets served by our product groups are competitive our competitors range in size from startups to large multinational corporations reliable independent information on sales and market share of products produced by our competitors is not generally available we believe however based on our own marketing information that while some competitors are dominant with respect to certain individual products no one company including us is dominant with respect to a material portion of any segment of our business

because of the breadth of its product lines life science does not face the same competitor for all of its products competitors in this market include ge biosciences invitrogen qiagen and applied biosystems applera we compete primarily based on meeting performance specifications

competitors in the clinical diagnostics segment range in size from small private companies to large multinational corporations we compete mainly in specific market niches and do not attempt to pursue the most competitive general diagnostics markets we compete based on our technological ability to provide customers with very specific tests and believe we are usually a significant competitor within our market niche competitors include abbott laboratories biomerieux inc roche diagnostics biochem pharma inova diasorin and medical analysis systems

product research and development 

the company conducts extensive product research and development activities in all areas of our business employing approximately 700 people worldwide in these activities research and development have played a major role in biorads growth and are expected to continue to do so in the future our research teams are continuously developing new products and new applications for existing products in our development and testing of new products and applications we consult with scientific and medical professionals at universities hospitals and medical schools and in industry excluding inprocess research and development we spent approximately 1083 million 913 million and 798 million on research and development activities during the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively

regulatory matters 

the manufacturing marketing and labeling of certain of our products primarily diagnostic products are subject to regulation in the united states by the center for devices and radiological health of the united states food and drug administration fda and in other jurisdictions by state and foreign government authorities fda regulations require that some new products have premarketing approval by the fda and require certain products to be manufactured in accordance with good manufacturing practices to be extensively tested and to be properly labeled to disclose test results and performance claims and limitations

as a multinational manufacturer and distributor of sophisticated instrumentation equipment we must meet a wide array of electromagnetic compatibility and safety compliance requirements to satisfy regulations in the united states the european community and other jurisdictions these requirements relating to testing and trials product licensing pricing and reimbursement vary widely among countries

 

our operations are subject to federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations that govern such activities as emissions to air and discharges to water as well as handling and disposal practices for solid hazardous and medical wastes in addition to environmental laws that regulate our operations we are also subject to environmental laws and regulations that create liabilities and cleanup responsibility for spills disposals or other releases of hazardous substances into the environment as a result of our operations or otherwise impacting real property that we own or operate the environmental laws and regulations also subject us to claims by third parties for damages resulting from any spills disposals or releases resulting from our operations or at any of our properties

controls and procedures 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures

as of the end of the period covered by this report the company carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the company’s management including the company’s chief executive officer and the company’s chief financial officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the company’s disclosure controls and procedures based upon that evaluation the company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that the company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that material information relating to the company is made known to management including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer

changes in internal control over financial reporting

there has been no change in the company’s internal controls over financial reporting during the company’s most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect the company’s internal controls over financial reporting

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting

the management of biorad laboratories is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in rule 13a15f under the securities and exchange act of 1934 as amended the “exchange act” the company’s internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the preparation and fair presentation of the company’s financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles

an internal control system over financial reporting has inherent limitations and may not prevent or detect misstatements therefore even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation

we excluded mj geneworks inc from our assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2004 because it was acquired by biorad in the third quarter of 2004 mj geneworks constituted less than 5 of total assets as of december 31 2004 and less than 5 of total revenues and net earnings for the year then ended refer to note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of this acquisition and its impact on biorad’s consolidated financial statements notwithstanding the exclusion of mj geneworks from our assessment there was no material change to our internal control over financial reporting due to the acquisition pursuant to rule 15d15 of the exchange act our assessment of internal control over financial reporting for fiscal year 2005 will include mj geneworks

management has used the framework set forth in the report entitled “internal control – integrated framework” published by the committee of sponsoring organizations coso of the treadway commission to evaluate the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2004 management has concluded the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 2004 the company’s independent auditor deloitte and touche llp has issued an attestation report on management’s assessment of the company’s internal control over financial reporting

report of independent registered public accounting firm on internal controls over financial reporting 

to the board of directors and stockholders of

biorad laboratories inc

hercules california

we have audited management’s assessment included in the accompanying management’s report on internal control over financial reporting that biorad laboratories inc and subsidiaries the “company” maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2004 based on criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission as described in management’s report on internal control over financial reporting management excluded from their assessment the internal control over financial reporting at mj geneworks inc and its subsidiaries “mj geneworks” which was acquired on august 17 2004 and whose financial statements reflect less than 5 of total consolidated assets as of december 31 2004 and less than 5 of consolidated revenues and net earnings for the year then ended accordingly our audit did not include the internal control over financial reporting at mj geneworks the company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting evaluating management’s assessment testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions and effected by the company’s board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements

because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis also projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate

in our opinion management’s assessment that the company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2004 is fairly stated in all material respects based on the criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission also in our opinion the company maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2004 based on the criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission

we have also audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule as of and for the year ended december 31 2004 of the company and our reports dated march 2 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule

    item 1 business

    general

    founded in 1957 biorad laboratories inc biorad or the
    company was initially engaged in the development and
    production of specialty chemicals used in biochemical
    pharmaceutical and other life science research applications  in
    1967 the company entered the field of clinical diagnostics with
    the development of its first test kit based on separation
    techniques and materials developed for life science research
    recognizing that the fields of clinical diagnostics and life
    science research were evolving toward more automated techniques
    biorad expanded into the field of analytical and measuring
    instrument systems through internal research and development
    efforts and acquisitions in the late 1970s and 1980s

    as biorad broadened its product lines it also expanded its
    geographical market  the company has distribution
    channels in over thirty countries outside the united states
    through subsidiaries whose primary focus is customer service and
    product distribution

    on october 1 1999 biorad acquired the stock of pasteur sanofi
    diagnostics psd and the rights to certain ancillary assets for
    210 million  psd was founded by the institut pasteur to
    commercialize its diagnostic research and holds certain
    exclusive licenses from the institut pasteur in the hiv and
    infectious disease diagnostic product market  psd also expanded
    the geographic reach and market penetration for the companys
    products particularly in latin america africa and france

    during 2000 and 2001 the company sold substantially all of its
    analytical instruments product lines  these divestitures have
    allowed the company to focus on its core segments of life science
    and clinical diagnostics

    biorad manufactures and supplies the life science research
    healthcare analytical chemistry and other markets with a broad
    range of products and systems used to separate complex chemical
    and biological materials and to identify analyze and purify
    their components

    description of business

    business segments

    the company operates in two industry segments designated as life
    science and clinical diagnostics  each operates in both the
    united states and international markets  for a description of
    business and financial information on industry and geographic
    segments see note 15 on pages 27 through 29 of exhibit 131

    life science segment

    life science is the study of the characteristics behavior and
    structure of living organisms and their component systems  life
    science researchers use a variety of products and systems
    including reagents instruments software and apparatus to
    advance the study of life processes drug discovery
    biotechnology and food pathogen testing primarily within a
    laboratory setting

    we focus on selected segments of the life science market
    proteomics genomics and cell biology  for which we estimate
    2003 worldwide sales totaled approximately 38 billion  the
    primary technological applications that we supply to these
    segments consist of electrophoresis image analysis molecular
    detection chromatography gene transfer sample preparation and
    amplification  the primary endusers in our sectors of the
    market are universities and medical schools industrial research
    organizations government agencies pharmaceutical manufacturers
    biotechnology researchers and food testing laboratories

    clinical diagnostics segment

    the clinical diagnostics industry encompasses a broad array of
    technologies incorporated into a variety of tests used to detect
    identify and quantify substances in blood or other bodily fluids
    and tissues  the test results are used as aids for medical
    diagnosis detection evaluation monitoring and treatment of
    diseases and other medical conditions  the bulk of tests are
    performed in vitro outside the body while the remainder
    consist of in vivo in the body tests  the most common type
    of in vitro tests are routine chemistry tests that measure
    important health parameters such as glucose cholesterol or
    sodium as part of routine blood checks  other diagnostic tests
    are more specialized and require more sophisticated equipment and
    materials than do routine tests  these specialized tests are
    also lowervolume and higherpriced than routine tests  we
    estimate that in 2003 the global clinical diagnostics market
    totaled approximately 235 billion

    the primary endusers in the areas of the clinical diagnostics
    industry we target are hospital laboratories reference
    laboratories physician office laboratories government agencies
    and other diagnostics manufacturers

    raw materials and components

    the company utilizes a wide variety of chemicals biological
    materials electronic components machined metal parts optical
    parts minicomputers and peripheral devices  most of these
    materials and components are available from numerous sources and
    the company has not experienced difficulty in securing adequate
    supplies

    patents and trademarks

    we own numerous us and international patents and patent
    licenses  we believe however that our ability to develop and
    manufacture our products depends primarily on our knowledge
    technology and special skills  under several patent license
    agreements we pay royalties on the sales of certain products
    we view these patents and license agreements as valuable assets

    seasonal operations and backlog

    the companys business is not inherently seasonal however the
    european custom of concentrating vacation during the summer
    months usually has had a negative impact on third quarter sales
    volume and operating income

    for the most part the company operates in markets characterized
    by short lead times and the absence of significant backlogs
    management has concluded that backlog information is not material
    to the companys business as a whole

    sales and marketing

    each of biorads segments maintains a sales force to sell its
    products on a direct basis  each sales force is technically
    trained in the disciplines associated with its products  sales
    are also generated through direct mail advertising exhibits at
    trade shows and technical meetings telemarketing the company
    website and by extensive advertising in technical and trade
    publications  sales and marketing efforts are augmented by
    technical service departments that assist customers in effective
    product utilization and in new product applications  biorad
    also produces and distributes technical literature and holds
    seminars for customers on the use of its products

    our customer base is broad and diversified  in 2003 no single
    customer accounted for more than 3 of our total net sales  our
    sales are affected by certain external factors  for example a
    number of our customers particularly in the life science
    segment are substantially dependent on government grants and
    research contracts for their funding a significant reduction of
    government funding would have a detrimental effect on the results
    of this segment

    the company is the leading provider of bse bovine spongiform
    encephalopathy or mad cow tests throughout the world  revenues
    from the sales of testing products for bse within our life
    science segment represented approximately 11 and 12 of
    consolidated net revenue in 2003 and 2002 respectively  a large
    portion of the revenue for this product is from government
    agencies currently mandating the use of the test  competition
    pricing changes in test standards technology or a decrease in
    government demand could negatively impact the companys future
    revenue from this product

    most of the companys international sales are generated by
    whollyowned subsidiaries and their branch offices in australia

    competition

    most markets served by our product groups are competitive  our
    competitors range in size from startups to large multinational
    corporations reliable independent information on sales and
    market share of products produced by our competitors is not
    generally available  we believe however based on our own
    marketing information that while some competitors are dominant
    with respect to certain individual products no one company
    including us is dominant with respect to a material portion of
    any segment of our business

    because of the breadth of its product lines life science does
    not face the same competitor for all of its products
    competitors in this market include amersham biosciences
    invitrogen qiagen zeiss olympus leica nikon and applied
    biosystems  we compete primarily based on meeting performance
    specifications

    competitors in the clinical diagnostics segment range in size
    from small private companies to large multinational corporations
    we compete mainly in specific market niches and do not attempt to
    pursue the most competitive general diagnostics markets  we
    compete based on our technological ability to provide customers
    with very specific tests and believe we are usually a significant
    competitor within our market niche  competitors include abbott
    laboratories biomerieux inc roche diagnostics biochem
    pharma inova diasorin and medical analysis systems

    product research and development

    the company conducts extensive product research and development
    activities in all areas of our business employing approximately
    550 people worldwide in these activities  research and
    development have played a major role in biorads growth and are
    expected to continue to do so in the future  our research teams
    are continuously developing new products and new applications for
    existing products  in our development and testing of new
    products and applications we consult with scientific and medical
    professionals at universities hospitals and medical schools and
    in industry  we spent approximately 943 million 829 million
    and 765 million on research and development activities during
    the years ended december 31 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively

          item 1 business

          general

          founded in 1957 biorad laboratories inc biorad or the
          company was initially engaged in the development and
          production of specialty chemicals used in biochemical
          pharmaceutical and other life science research applications  in
          1967 the company entered the field of clinical diagnostics with
          the development of its first test kit based on separation
          techniques and materials developed for life science research
          recognizing that the fields of clinical diagnostics and life
          science research were evolving toward more automated techniques
          biorad expanded into the field of analytical and measuring
          instrument systems through internal research and development
          efforts and acquisitions in the late 1970s and 1980s

          as biorad broadened its product lines it also expanded its
          geographical market  the company has distribution
          channels in thirty countries outside the united states through
          subsidiaries whose primary focus is customer service and
          product distribution

          on october 1 1999 biorad acquired the stock of pasteur sanofi
          diagnostics psd and the rights to certain ancillary assets for
          210 million  psd was founded by the institut pasteur to
          commercialize its diagnostic research and holds certain
          exclusive licenses from the institut pasteur in the hiv and
          infectious disease diagnostic product market  psd also expanded
          the geographic reach and market penetration for the companys
          product particularly in latin america africa and france

          during 2000 and 2001 the company sold substantially all of its
          analytical instruments product lines  these divestitures have
          allowed the company to focus on its core segments of life science
          and clinical diagnostics

          biorad manufactures and supplies the life science research
          healthcare analytical chemistry and other markets with a broad
          range of products and systems used to separate complex chemical
          and biological materials and to identify analyze and purify
          their components

          description of business

          business segments

          the company operates in two industry segments designated as life
          science and clinical diagnostics  each operates in both the
          united states and international markets  for a description of
          business and financial information on industry and geographic
          segments see note 15 on pages 27 through 29 of exhibit 131

          life science segment

          life science is the study of the characteristics behavior and
          structure of living organisms and their component systems  life
          science researchers use a variety of products and systems
          including reagents instruments software and apparatus to
          advance the study of life processes drug discovery
          biotechnology and food pathogen testing primarily within a
          laboratory setting

          we focus on selected segments of the life science market
          proteomics genomics and cell biology  for which we estimate
          2002 worldwide sales totaled approximately 3 billion  the
          primary technological applications that we supply to these
          segments consist of electrophoresis image analysis molecular
          detection chromatography gene transfer sample preparation and
          amplification  the primary endusers in our sectors of the
          market are universities and medical schools industrial research
          organizations government agencies pharmaceutical manufacturers
          biotechnology researchers and food testing laboratories

          clinical diagnostics segment

          the clinical diagnostics industry encompasses a broad array of
          technologies incorporated into a variety of tests used to detect
          identify and quantify substances in blood or other bodily fluids
          and tissues  the test results are used as aids for medical
          diagnosis detection evaluation monitoring and treatment of
          diseases and other medical conditions  the bulk of tests are
          performed in vitro literally in glass while the remainder
          consists of in vivo in the body tests  the most common type
          of in vitro tests are routine chemistry tests that measure
          important health parameters such as glucose cholesterol or
          sodium as part of routine blood checks  other diagnostic tests
          are more specialized and require more sophisticated equipment and
          materials than do routine tests  these specialized tests are
          also lowervolume and higherpriced than routine tests  we
          estimate that in 2002 sales to the global clinical diagnostics
          industry totaled approximately 22 billion

          the primary endusers in the areas of the clinical diagnostics
          industry we target are hospital laboratories reference
          laboratories physician office laboratories government agencies
          and other diagnostics manufacturers

          raw materials and components

          the company utilizes a wide variety of chemicals biological
          materials electronic components machined metal parts optical
          parts minicomputers and peripheral devices  most of these
          materials and components are available from numerous sources and
          the company has not experienced difficulty in securing adequate
          supplies

          patents and trademarks

          we own numerous us and international patents and patent
          licenses  we believe however that our ability to develop and
          manufacture our products depends primarily on our knowledge
          technology and special skills  under several patent license
          agreements we pay royalties on the sales of certain products
          we view these patents and license agreements as valuable assets

          seasonal operations and backlog

          the companys business is not inherently seasonal however the
          european custom of concentrating vacation during the summer
          months usually has had a negative impact on third quarter sales
          volume and operating income

          for the most part the company operates in markets characterized
          by short lead times and the absence of significant backlogs
          management has concluded that backlog information is not material
          to the companys business as a whole

          sales and marketing

          each of biorads segments maintains a sales force to sell its
          products on a direct basis  each sales force is technically
          trained in the disciplines associated with its products  sales
          are also generated  through direct mail advertising exhibits at
          trade shows and technical meetings telemarketing the company
          website and by extensive advertising in technical and trade
          publications  sales and marketing efforts are augmented by
          technical service departments that assist customers in effective
          product utilization and in new product applications  biorad
          also produces and distributes technical literature and holds
          seminars for customers on the use of its products

          our customer base is broad and diversified  in 2002 no single
          customer accounted for more than 2 of our total net sales  our
          sales are affected by certain external factors  for example a
          number of our customers particularly in the life science
          segment are substantially dependent on government grants and
          research contracts for their funding a significant reduction of
          government funding would have a detrimental effect on the results
          of this segment

          the company is the leading provider of bse bovine spongiform
          encephalopathy or mad cow tests throughout the world  a large
          portion of the revenue for this product is from government
          agencies currently mandating the use of the test  competition
          pricing changes in test standards technology or a decrease in
          government demand could negatively impact the companys future
          revenue from this product

          most of the companys international sales are generated by
          whollyowned subsidiaries and their branch offices in australia
          austria belgium brazil canada the czech republic denmark
          england finland france germany hong kong hungary

          fluctuations the companys international operations are

          competition

          most markets served by our product groups are competitive  our
          competitors range in size from startups to large multinational
          corporations reliable independent information on sales and
          market share of products produced by our competitors is not
          generally available  we believe however based on our own
          marketing information that while some competitors are dominant
          with respect to certain individual products no one company
          including us is dominant with respect to a material portion of
          any segment of our business

          life science segment  because of the breadth of its product
          lines life science does not face the same competitor for all of
          its products  competitors in this market include amersham
          biosciences invitrogen qiagen zeiss and applied biosystems
          we compete primarily on meeting performance specifications

          clinical diagnostics segment  competitors in this segment range
          in size from small private companies to large multinational
          corporations  we compete only in very specific market niches and
          do not attempt to pursue the most competitive general diagnostics

           item 1 business

           general

           founded in 1957 biorad laboratories inc biorad or the
           company was initially engaged in the development and
           production of specialty chemicals used in biochemical
           pharmaceutical and other life science research applications  in
           1967 the company entered the field of clinical diagnostics with
           the development of its first test kit based on separation
           techniques and materials developed for life science research
           recognizing that the fields of clinical diagnostics and life
           science research were evolving toward more automated techniques
           biorad expanded into the field of analytical and measuring
           instrument systems through internal research and development
           efforts and acquisitions in the late 1970s and 1980s

           as biorad broadened its product lines it also expanded its
           geographical market  the company has distribution
           channels in thirty countries outside the united states through
           subsidiaries whose primary focus is customer service and
           product distribution

           on october 1 1999 biorad acquired the stock of pasteur sanofi
           diagnostics psd and the rights to certain ancillary assets for
           210 million  psd was founded by the institut pasteur to
           commercialize its diagnostic research and holds certain
           exclusive licenses from the institut pasteur in the hiv and
           infectious disease diagnostic product market  psd also expanded
           the geographic reach and market penetration for the companys
           product particularly in latin america africa and france

           during 2000 and 2001 the company sold the majority of its
           analytical instruments product lines  these divestitures will
           allow the company to focus on its core segments of life science
           and clinical diagnostics

           biorad manufactures and supplies the life science research
           healthcare analytical chemistry and other markets with a broad
           range of products and systems used to separate complex chemical
           and biological materials and to identify analyze and purify
           their components

           life science segment

           life science is the study of the characteristics behavior and
           structure of living organisms and their component systems  life
           science researchers use a variety of products and systems
           including reagents instruments software and apparatus to
           advance the study of life processes drug discovery
           biotechnology and food pathogen testing primarily within a
           laboratory setting

           we focus on selected segments of the life science market
           proteomics genomics and cell biology  for which we estimate
           2001 worldwide sales totaled approximately 3 billion  the
           primary technological applications that we supply to these
           segments consist of electrophoresis image analysis molecular
           detection chromatography gene transfer sample preparation and
           amplification  the primary endusers in our sectors of the
           market are universities and medical schools industrial research
           organizations government agencies pharmaceutical manufacturers
           biotechnology researchers and food testing laboratories

           clinical diagnostics segment

           the clinical diagnostics industry encompasses a broad array of
           technologies incorporated into a variety of tests used to detect
           identify and quantify substances in blood or other bodily fluids
           and tissues  the test results are used as aids for medical
           diagnosis detection evaluation monitoring and treatment of
           diseases and other medical conditions  the bulk of tests are
           performed in vitro literally in glass while the remainder
           consists of in vivo in the body tests  the most common type
           of in vitro tests are routine chemistry tests that measure
           important health parameters such as glucose cholesterol or
           sodium as part of routine blood checks  other diagnostic tests
           are more specialized and require more sophisticated equipment and
           materials than do routine tests  these specialized tests are
           also lowervolume and higherpriced than routine tests  we
           estimate that in 2001 sales to the global clinical diagnostics
           industry totaled approximately 21 billion

           the primary endusers in the areas of the clinical diagnostics
           industry we target are hospital laboratories reference
           laboratories physician office laboratories government agencies
           and other diagnostics manufacturers

           patents and trademarks

           we own numerous us and international patents and patent
           licenses  we believe however that our ability to develop and
           manufacture our products depends primarily on our knowledge
           technology and special skills  under several patent license
           agreements we pay royalties on the sales of certain products
           we view these patents and license agreements as valuable assets

           seasonal operations and backlog

           the companys business is not inherently seasonal however the
           european custom of concentrating vacation during the summer
           months usually has had a negative impact on third quarter sales
           volume and operating income

           for the most part the company operates in markets characterized
           by short lead times and the absence of significant backlogs  the
           company produces only limited instruments against an order
           backlog  management has concluded that backlog information is
           not material to the companys business as a whole

           sales and marketing

           each of biorads segments maintains a sales force to sell its
           products on a direct basis  each sales force is technically
           trained in the disciplines associated with its products  sales
           are also generated  through direct mail advertising exhibits at
           trade shows and technical meetings telemarketing the company
           website and by extensive advertising in technical and trade
           publications  sales and marketing efforts are augmented by
           technical service departments that assist customers in effective
           product utilization and in new product applications  biorad
           also produces and distributes technical literature and holds
           seminars for customers on the use of its products

           our customer base is broad and diversified  in 2001 no single
           customer accounted for more than 2 of our total net sales  our
           sales are affected by certain external factors  for example a
           number of our customers particularly in the life science
           segment are substantially dependent on government grants and
           research contracts for their funding a significant reduction of
           government funding would have a detrimental effect on the results
           of this segment

           most of the companys international sales are generated by
           whollyowned subsidiaries and their branch offices in australia
           austria belgium brazil canada the czech republic denmark
           england finland france germany hong kong hungary india
           israel italy japan korea mexico the netherlands new
           zealand norway peoples republic of china poland portugal
           russia singapore south africa spain sweden switzerland
           taiwan and thailand  certain of these subsidiaries also have
           manufacturing facilities  while biorads international
           operations are subject to certain risks common to foreign
           operations in general such as changes in governmental

           regulations import restrictions and foreign exchange
           fluctuations the companys international operations are
           principally in developed nations which the company regards as
           presenting no significantly greater risks to its operations than
           are present in the united states

           competition

           most markets served by our product groups are competitive  our
           competitors range in size from startups to large multinational
           corporations reliable independent information on sales and
           market share of products produced by our competitors is not
           generally available  we believe however based on our own
           marketing information that while some competitors are dominant
           with respect to certain individual products no one company
           including us is dominant with respect to a material portion of
           any segment of our business

           life science segment  because of the breadth of its product
           lines life science does not face the same competitor for all of
           its products  competitors in this market include amersham
           biosciences qiagen zeiss and applied biosystems  we compete
           primarily on meeting performance specifications

           clinical diagnostics segment  competitors in this segment range
           in size from small private companies to large multinational
           corporations  we compete only in very specific market niches and
           do not attempt to pursue the most competitive general diagnostics
           markets  we compete based on our technological ability to
           provide customers with very specific tests and believe we are
           usually a significant competitor within our market niche
           competitors include abbott laboratories biomerieux inc roche
           diagnostics biochem pharma inova diasorin and medical analysis
           systems

           product research and development

           the company conducts extensive product research and development
           activities in all areas of our business employing  approximately
           470 people worldwide in these activities  research and
           development have played a major role in biorads growth and are
           expected to continue to do so in the future  our research teams
           are continuously developing new products and new applications for
           existing products  in our development and testing of new
           products and applications we consult with scientific and medical
           professionals at universities hospitals and medical schools and
           in industry  we spent approximately 765 million 681 million
           and 512 million excluding 155 million of purchased in
           process research and development expenseon research and
           development activities during the years ended december 31 2001
           2000 and 1999 respectively

           regulatory matters

           the manufacturing marketing and labeling of certain of our
           products primarily diagnostic products are subject to
           regulation in the united states by the center for devices and

           administration fda and in other jurisdictions by state and
           foreign government authorities  fda regulations require that

           to satisfy regulations in the united states the european
           community and other jurisdictions  the fda must approve an

       item 1 business

       general

       founded in 1957 biorad laboratories inc biorad or the
       company was initially engaged in the development and
       production of specialty chemicals used in biochemical
       pharmaceutical and other life science research applications  in
       1967 the company entered the field of clinical diagnostics with
       the development of its first test kit based on separation
       techniques and materials developed for life science research
       recognizing that the fields of clinical diagnostics and life
       science research were evolving toward more automated techniques
       biorad expanded into the field of analytical and measuring
       instrument systems through internal research and development
       efforts and acquisitions in the late 1970s and 1980s

       as biorad broadened its product lines it also expanded its
       geographical market  the company controls its distribution
       channels in thirty countries outside the usa through
       subsidiaries whose primary focus is customer service and
       product distribution

       during 1996 and 1997 the company made five acquisitions  the
       assets acquired from chiron diagnostics corporation and chiron
       corporation on december 5 1997 enhanced the product line
       offering for diagnostic controls  the remaining acquisitions
       broadened product line offerings within the analytical
       instruments and life science segments

       on october 1 1999 biorad acquired the stock of pasteur sanofi
       diagnostics psd and the rights to certain ancillary assets
       for 210 million  psd was founded by the institut pasteur to
       commercialize its diagnostic research and holds certain
       exclusive licenses from the institut pasteur in the hiv and
       infectious disease diagnostic product market  psd also expanded
       the geographic reach and market penetration for the companys
       product particularly in latin america africa and france

       biorad manufactures and supplies the life science research
       healthcare analytical chemistry semiconductor and other markets
       with a broad range of products and systems used to separate
       complex chemical and biological materials and to identify
       analyze and purify their components

       description of business

       business segments

       the company operates in three industry segments designated life
       science clinical diagnostics and analytical instruments  each
       operates in both the usa and international markets  for a
       description of business and financial information on industry and
       geographic segments see note 13 on pages 22 through 25 of
       exhibit 131 which is incorporated herein by reference

       life science segment

       life science is the study of the characteristics behavior and
       structure of living organisms and their component systems  life
       science researchers use a variety of products and systems
       including reagents instruments software and apparatus to
       advance the study of life processes drug discovery and
       biotechnology primarily within a laboratory setting

       we focus on selected segments of the life science market
       laboratory devices biomaterials imaging products and microscopy
       systems for which we estimate 2000 worldwide sales totaled
       approximately 16 billion  the primary technological
       applications that we supply to these segments are diverse and
       consist of electrophoresis image analysis and microplate
       readers chromatography gene transfer and sample preparation and
       amplification  the primary endusers in our sectors of the
       market are universities and medical schools industrial research
       organizations government agencies pharmaceutical manufacturers
       and biotechnology researchers

       clinical diagnostics segment

       the clinical diagnostics industry encompasses a broad array of
       technologies incorporated into a variety of tests used to detect
       identify and quantify substances in blood or other bodily fluids
       and tissues  the test results are used as aids for medical
       diagnosis detection evaluation monitoring and treatment of
       diseases and other medical conditions  the bulk of tests are
       performed in vitro literally in glass while the remainder
       consists of in vivo in the body tests  the most common type
       of in vitro tests are routine chemistry tests that measure
       important health parameters such as glucose cholesterol or
       sodium as part of routine blood checks  a second type of
       diagnostic tests on which we focus are more specialized and
       require more sophisticated equipment and materials than do
       routine tests  these specialized tests are also lowervolume and
       higherpriced than routine tests  we estimate that in 2000
       sales to the global clinical diagnostics industry totaled
       approximately 20 billion

       the primary endusers in the areas of the clinical diagnostics
       industry we target are hospital laboratories reference
       laboratories physician office laboratories government agencies
       and other diagnostics manufacturers

       analytical instruments segment

       the analytical instruments segment develops manufacturers sells
       and services ftir spectroscopy systems semiconductor tests and
       manufacturing instruments spectral reference publications and
       software  on july 31 2000 biorad sold the assets of its
       semiconductor product line to accent semiconductor technology
       inc and will no longer directly compete in this market

       spectrometers measure the infrared spectra of materials
       providing quantitative and qualitative information about their

                                       2
page



       chemical composition  the primary endusers for spectrometers
       are scientists and researchers in a wide range of industries
       including chemicals pharmaceuticals biotechnology and food
       applications for the products are varied but range from general
       analytical purposes to research and development and quality
       control

       the primary endusers for spectral databases chemists and
       spectroscopists use them to identify a sample through the
       spectrum it produces against a spectra of known compounds  a
       variety of market segments use these products including the
       chemical pharmaceutical biotechnology forensic and
       environmental chemistry industries as well as academic
       researchers

       raw materials and components

       the company utilizes a wide variety of chemicals biological
       materials electronic components machined metal parts optical
       parts minicomputers and peripheral devices  most of these
       materials and components are available from numerous sources and
       the company has not experienced difficulty in securing adequate
       supplies


       patents and trademarks

       we own numerous us and international patents and patent
       licenses  we believe however that our ability to develop and
       manufacture our products depends primarily on our knowledge
       technology and special skills  under several patent license
       agreements we pay royalties on the sales of certain products
       we view these patents and license agreements as valuable assets

       the clinical diagnostics segment has a broad portfolio of
       intellectual property which it uses to advance and promote its
       competitive position within the market of blood viruses
       bacteriology immunohematology infectious diseases and
       cardiovascular testing  its portfolio is comprised of owned
       patents patent rights licensed from institut pasteur and other
       rights secured under thirdparty licensing agreements
       additionally this segment has a wide array of patents and patent
       applications which are owned and licensed in the area of hiv
       testing  these include patents on purified virus proteins
       antigens used for detection of hiv monoclonal antibodies cloned
       dna sequences primers and probes

       seasonal operations and backlog

       the companys business is not inherently seasonal however the
       european custom of concentrating vacation during the summer
       months usually has had a negative impact on third quarter sales
       volume and operating income

       for the most part the company operates in markets characterized
       by short lead times and the absence of significant backlogs  the
       company produces some analytical instruments against an order

                                       3
page



       backlog  management has concluded that backlog information is
       not material to the companys business as a whole

       sales and marketing

       each of biorads segments maintains a sales force to sell its
       products on a direct basis  each sales force is technically
       trained in the disciplines associated with its products  sales
       are also generated  through direct mail advertising exhibits at
       trade shows and technical meetings telemarketing the company
       website and by extensive advertising in technical and trade
       publications  sales and marketing efforts are augmented by
       technical service departments that assist customers in effective
       product utilization and in new product applications  biorad
       also produces and distributes technical literature and holds
       seminars for customers on the use of its products

       our customer base is broad and diversified  in 2000 no single
       customer accounted for more than 3 of our total net sales  our
       sales are affected by certain external factors  for example a
       number of our customers particularly in the life science
       segment are substantially dependent on government grants and
       research contracts for their funding a significant reduction of
       government funding would have a detrimental effect on the results
       of this segment

       most of the companys international sales are generated by
       whollyowned subsidiaries and their branch offices in australia
       austria belgium brazil canada the czech republic denmark
       england finland france germany hong kong hungary india
       israel italy japan korea mexico the netherlands new
       zealand norway peoples republic of china poland portugal
       russia singapore south africa spain sweden switzerland
       taiwan and thailand  certain of these subsidiaries also have
       manufacturing facilities  while biorads international
       operations are subject to certain risks common to foreign
       operations in general such as changes in governmental
       regulations import restrictions and foreign exchange
       fluctuations the companys international operations are
       principally in developed nations which the company regards as
       presenting no significantly greater risks to its operations than
       are present in the united states

       competition

       most markets served by our product groups are competitive  our
