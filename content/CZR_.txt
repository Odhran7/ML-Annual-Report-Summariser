market activities 

trends 

covid19 and related impacts — the extent of the ongoing and future effects of covid19 on our business and the casino resort industry and economy generally remains uncertain while we experienced positive operating trends in 2021 we continued to see a prolonged impact of covid19 on the economy our industry and our company with increased challenges arising from labor shortages supply chain challenges increasing costs of goods and services inflation and rising interest rates among other impacts the continuing impact of covid19 and such related challenges on our business will depend on future developments including but not limited to the duration and severity of the outbreak or new variants restrictions on operations imposed by governmental authorities the potential for authorities reimposing stay at home orders international and domestic travel restrictions or additional restrictions in response to continued developments with covid19 the company’s ability to adapt to evolving operating procedures and maintain adequate staffing in response to increased consumer demand and discretionary spending the efficacy and acceptance of vaccines in response to any potential new variants and the company’s ability to adjust its cost structures for the duration of the outbreak’s effect on our operations we also expect that our business and the casino resort industry and economy generally will continue to be impacted by shortages of labor supply chain challenges increasing costs of goods and services inflation and rising interest rates and that such impacts may intensify 

online betting and gaming — online betting and gaming is a rapidly developing sector of the ecommerce industry and we believe the digital segment of the global betting and gaming industry will continue to grow in popularity and consumer confidence the market for online betting platforms is being driven by increased use of digital processes and global growing bettor demand we anticipate that the united states market will begin to have a strong and steady uptake in active wagers as 

statebystate legislation in the united states continues to evolve in response to recent legislation resulting in new opportunities in the united states sports betting market the extent and future effects of online betting and gaming on our casino properties is uncertain but we expect that our online betting and gaming offering will be complementary to our brickandmortar casino business 

competition 

the casino entertainment business is highly competitive the industry is comprised of a diverse group of competitors that vary considerably in size and geographic diversity quality of facilities and amenities available marketing and growth strategies and financial condition in most regions we compete directly with other casino facilities operating in the immediate and surrounding areas in las vegas our largest jurisdiction competition is expected to increase in the coming years in response to changing trends las vegas operators have been focused on expanding their nongaming offerings including upgrades to hotel rooms new food and beverage offerings and new entertainment offerings there have also been proposals for other large scale nongaming development projects in las vegas by various other developers our las vegas strip hotels and casinos also compete in part with each other 

in recent years many casino operators including us have been reinvesting in existing facilities developing or rebranding new casinos or complementary facilities and acquiring established facilities these reinvestment and expansion efforts combined with aggressive marketing strategies by us and many of our competitors have resulted in increased competition in many regions as companies have completed new expansion projects supply has grown at a faster pace than demand in some areas the expansion of properties and entertainment venues into new jurisdictions also presents competitive issues 

our properties also compete with legalized gaming from casinos located on native american tribal lands while the competitive impact on operations in las vegas from the continued growth of native american gaming establishments in california remains uncertain the proliferation of gaming in california and other areas located in the same regions as our properties could have an adverse effect on our results of operations in some instances particularly in the case of native american casinos our competitors pay lower taxes or no taxes in addition certain states have legalized and others may legalize casino gaming in specific areas including metropolitan areas from which we traditionally attract customers these factors create additional challenges for us in competing for customers and accessing cash flow or financing to fund improvements for our casino and entertainment products that enable us to remain competitive 

we also compete with other nongaming resorts and vacation areas various other entertainment businesses and other forms of gaming such as state lotteries ontrack and offtrack wagering video lottery terminals and card parlors our nongaming offerings also compete with other retail facilities amusement attractions food and beverage offerings and entertainment venues internet gaming and sports betting also create additional competition for our brickandmortar operations 

we face significant competition in our online sports betting and igaming businesses in jurisdictions where we currently operate although we have experienced recent success in obtaining approval for sports betting and igaming licenses in new jurisdictions new state launches require significant upfront investment our investment into new markets is executed through promotional incentives marketing and advertising spend to establish ourselves as an industry leader 

resources material to business 

rewards programs

 item 1a risk factors 

risks relating to operating our business 

the outbreak of covid19 and covid19 related impacts have had and are expected to continue to have a significant impact on our operations and results of operations 

covid19 and mitigation measures recommended or required by public health officials to slow the spread of covid19 have materially adversely affected our operations all of our casino properties were temporarily closed for the period from midmarch 2020 through midmay 2020 due to orders issued by various government agencies and tribal bodies and following reopening of our properties our operations have been affected by social distancing measures including reduced gaming operations limitations on number of customers present in our facilities restrictions on hotel food and beverage outlets and limits on events that would otherwise attract customers to our properties while restrictions on our operations were eased in 2021 and we experienced positive operating trends during 2021 we continued to see a prolonged impact of covid19 on the economy our industry and our company with increased challenges arising from labor shortages supply chain challenges increasing costs of goods and services inflation and rising interest rates among other impacts the continuing impact of covid19 and such related challenges on our business will ultimately depend on future developments including but not limited to the duration and severity of the outbreak or new variants restrictions on operations imposed by governmental authorities the potential for authorities reimposing stay at home orders international and domestic travel restrictions or additional restrictions in response to continued developments with the covid19 public health emergency our ability to adapt to evolving operating procedures and maintain adequate staffing in response to increased customer demand the impact on consumer demand and discretionary spending the efficacy and acceptance of vaccines and our ability to adjust our cost structures for the duration of any such interruption of our operations the extent and duration of the impact of covid19 on our business is difficult to predict but it could be significant and protracted and we expect that our business and the casino resort industry and economy generally will continue to be impacted by shortages of labor supply chain challenges increasing costs of goods and services inflation and rising interest rates and that such impacts may intensify 

we face substantial competition and expect that such competition will continue 

the gaming industry is highly competitive and competition is intense in most of the markets in which we operate we compete with a variety of gaming operations including landbased casinos dockside casinos riverboat casinos casinos located on racing tracks and casinos located on native american reservations and other forms of legalized gaming such as video gaming terminals at bars restaurants and truck stops and online gambling and sports betting we also compete to a lesser extent with other forms of legalized gaming and entertainment such as bingo pull tab games card parlors sportsbooks fantasy sports websites “cruisetonowhere” operations parimutuel or telephonic betting on horse racing and dog racing statesponsored lotteries jaialai and in the future may compete with gaming at other venues in addition we compete more generally with other forms of entertainment for the discretionary spending of our customers in some instances particularly in the case of native american casinos our competitors pay lower taxes or no taxes 

in recent years many casino and online gaming operators including us have reinvested in existing jurisdictions to attract new customers or to gain market share thereby increasing competition in those jurisdictions in particular we and other online betting and gaming operators have undertaken extensive marketing campaigns and made significant investments in customer acquisition through pricing and promotional policies in addition in response to changing trends las vegas operators have been focused on expanding their nongaming offerings including upgrades to hotel rooms new food and beverage offerings and new entertainment offerings the expansion of online betting and gaming in new jurisdictions and the growth of the number of competitors in the online betting and gaming market the expansion of existing casino entertainment properties the increase in the number of properties and the aggressive marketing strategies of many of our competitors have increased competition in many markets in which we operate and this intense competition is expected to continue these competitive pressures have and are expected to continue to adversely affect our financial performance 

our brickandmortar operations face increasing competition as a result of the expansion of legalized online gaming and betting including our own online betting and gaming operations in a number of the jurisdictions in which we operate while we believe that we are well positioned to compete with new entrants to the betting and gaming market through our online betting and gaming offerings the competitive dynamic is evolving and we cannot assure you that our results of operations will not be adversely impacted by the expansion of legalized online gaming and betting 

states that already have legalized casino gaming may further expand gaming and other states that have not yet legalized gaming may do so in the future we also compete with native american gaming operations in california and other jurisdictions where native american tribes operate largescale gaming facilities or otherwise conduct gaming activities on native american lands which we expect will continue to expand further expansion of legalized casino gaming in jurisdictions in or near our 

markets or changes to gaming laws in states in which we have operations and in states near our operations could increase competition and could adversely affect our operations 

increased competition may require us to make substantial expenditures in marketing customer development and capital projects to maintain and enhance the competitive positions of our online and brick and mortar operations to increase the attractiveness and add to the appeal of our facilities and product offerings because a significant portion of our cash flow is required to pay obligations under our outstanding indebtedness and our lease obligations there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient funds to undertake or that we will be able to obtain sufficient financing to fund such expenditures if we are unable to make such expenditures our competitive position could be negatively affected 

our business is sensitive to reductions in discretionary consumer spending as a result of downturns in the economy and other factors outside our control 

consumer demand for casino hotel and racetrack properties and online betting and gaming is particularly sensitive to downturns in the economy and the associated impact on discretionary spending on leisure activities changes in discretionary consumer spending or consumer preferences brought about by factors such as perceived or actual general economic conditions effects of declines in consumer confidence in the economy the impact of high energy and food costs the increased cost of travel decreased disposable consumer income and wealth fears of war and future acts of terrorism or widespread illnesses or epidemics including covid19 can have a material adverse effect on leisure and business travel discretionary spending and other areas of economic behavior that directly impact the gaming and entertainment industries in general and could further reduce customer demand for the amenities and products that we offer in addition increases in gasoline prices including increases prompted by global political and economic instabilities can adversely affect our casino operations because most of our patrons travel to our properties by car or on airlines that may pass on increases in fuel costs to passengers in the form of higher ticket prices 

win rates hold rates for our casino operations depend on a variety of factors some of which are beyond our control and participation in the sports betting industry exposes us to trading liability management and pricing risks we may experience lower than expected profitability and potentially significant losses as a result of factors beyond our control or a failure to accurately determine odds 

the gaming industry is characterized by an element of chance accordingly we employ theoretical win rates to estimate what a certain type of game on average will win or lose in the long run in addition to the element of chance win rates hold percentages are also affected by the spread of table limits and factors that are beyond our control such as a player’s skill experience and behavior the mix of games played the financial resources of players the volume of bets placed and the amount of time players spend gambling as a result of the variability in these factors the actual win rates at our casinos may differ from the theoretical win rates we have estimated and could result in the winnings of our gaming customers exceeding those anticipated the variability of win rates hold rates also have the potential to negatively impact our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our fixedodds betting products involve betting where winnings are paid on the basis of the amounts wagered and the odds quoted odds are determined with the objective of providing an average return to the bookmaker over a large number of events however there can be significant variation in gross win percentage eventbyevent and daybyday we have systems and controls that seek to reduce the risk of daily losses occurring on a grosswin basis but there can be no assurance that these will be effective in reducing our exposure to this risk as a result we may experience and we have from time to time experienced significant losses with respect to individual events or betting outcomes in particular if large individual bets are placed on an event or betting outcome or series of events or betting outcomes any significant losses on a grosswin basis could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition the odds that we offer in our sportsbook operations may occasionally contain an obvious error examples of such errors are inverted lines between teams or odds that are significantly different from the true odds of the outcome in a way that all reasonable persons would agree is an error if regulatory restrictions do not permit us to void or resetting odds to correct odds on bets associated with large obvious errors in odds making we could be subject to covering significant liabilities 

we rely on third parties to provide services that are essential to the operation of our online betting and gaming business including player account management geolocation and identity verification payment processing and sports data 

we rely on third parties to provide services that are essential to the operation of our online betting and gaming business including player account management geolocation and identity verification systems to ensure we comply with laws and regulations processing deposits and withdrawals made by our online users and providing information regarding schedules results performance and outcomes of sporting events to determine when and how bets are settled the software systems and services provided by our thirdparty providers may not meet our expectations contain errors or weaknesses be compromised or 

experience outages a failure of such thirdparty systems to perform effectively or any service interruption to those systems could adversely affect our business by preventing users from accessing our online platform delaying payment or resulting in errors in settling bets which could give rise to regulatory issues relating to the operation of our business by way of example incorrect or misleading geolocation and identity verification data with respect to current or potential users received from thirdparty service providers may result in us inadvertently allowing access to our offerings to individuals who are not permitted to access them or otherwise inadvertently denying access to individuals who are permitted to access them and errors or failures by our payment processors and sports data providers could result in a failure in timely and accurately process payments to and from users or errors in settling bets any such errors or failures could result in violations of applicable regulatory requirements and adversely affect our reputation and our ability to attract and retain our online users furthermore negative publicity related to any of our thirdparty partners could adversely affect our reputation and brand and could potentially lead to increased regulatory or litigation exposure 

in addition if any of our thirdparty services providers terminates its relationship with us is unable to maintain necessary regulatory approvals or refuses to renew its agreement with us on commercially reasonable terms we would have to find alternate service providers we cannot be certain that we would be able to secure favorable terms from alternative service providers that are critical to the operation of our business or enter into alternative arrangements in a timely manner our digital business results of operations and prospects would be adversely impacted by our inability or delay in securing replacement services that are sufficient to support our online business or are on comparable terms 

the growth of our digital business will depend in part on the success of our strategic relationships with third parties 

we rely on relationships with sports leagues and teams media companies and other third parties in order to attract users to our offerings in 2019 we entered into an exclusive sports entertainment partnership with the nfl making us the first ever “official casino sponsor” in the history of the league and in 2020 we partnered with espn to integrate their digital platforms with our sportsbooks these relationships along with providers of online services search engines social media directories and other websites and ecommerce businesses direct consumers to our offerings while we believe there are other third parties that could drive users to our online offerings adding or transitioning to them may disrupt our business and increase our costs and may require us to modify limit or discontinue certain offerings furthermore sports leagues teams and venues may enter into exclusive partnerships with our competitors which could adversely affect our ability to offer certain types of wagers in the event that any of our existing relationships or our future relationships fail to provide services to us in accordance with the terms of our arrangement or at all and we are not able to find suitable alternatives this could impact our ability to cost effectively attract consumers and harm our online betting and gaming business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

the growth of our digital business will require investments in our online offerings technology and strategic marketing initiatives which could be costly and negatively impact the economics of our online business 

the online betting and gaming industry is subject to rapid and frequent changes in standards technologies products and service offerings as well as in customer demands and preferences and regulations which will require us to continually introduce and successfully implement new and innovative technologies marketing strategies product offerings and enhancements to remain competitive and effectively stimulate customer demand acceptance and engagement the process of developing new online offerings and systems is inherently complex and uncertain and new offerings may not be well received by users even if they are wellreviewed and of high quality developing new offerings and marketing strategies can also divert our management’s attention from other business issues and opportunities new online offerings that attain market acceptance and aggressive marketing strategies implemented in the competitive online market environment could impact the mix of our existing business including our casino business or the share of our patron’s wallets in a manner that could negatively impact our results of operations in addition online betting and gaming operates in a competitive environment that requires significant investment in marketing initiatives including free play and use of a variety of free and paid marketing channels including television radio social media platforms such as facebook instagram twitter and other digital channels we cannot be sure that our investments in technology products service offerings and marketing initiatives will be successful or generate the return on investment that we expect if new or existing competitors offer more attractive offerings or engage in marketing initiatives that are better received by customers we may lose users or users may decrease their spending on our offerings further new customer demands superior competitive offerings new industry standards or changes in the regulatory environment could render our offerings unattractive unmarketable or obsolete and require us to make substantial unanticipated changes to our technology or business model failure to adapt to a rapidly changing market or evolving customer demands and costs required to be incurred to react to dynamic market conditions could harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

we face the risk of fraud theft and cheating 

we face the risk that gaming customers may attempt or commit fraud or theft or cheat in order to increase winnings such acts of fraud theft or cheating could involve the use of counterfeit chips or other tactics possibly in collusion with our employees internal acts of cheating could also be conducted by employees through collusion with dealers surveillance staff floor managers or other casino or gaming area staff additionally we also face the risk that customers may attempt or commit fraud or theft with respect to our nongaming offerings or against other customers such risks include stolen credit or charge cards or cash falsified checks theft of retail inventory and purchased goods and unpaid or counterfeit receipts failure to discover such acts or schemes in a timely manner could result in losses in our operations negative publicity related to such acts or schemes could have an adverse effect on our reputation potentially causing a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we extend credit to a portion of our customers and we may not be able to collect gaming receivables from our credit customers 

we conduct our gaming activities on a credit and cash basis any such credit we extend is unsecured highstakes players typically are extended more credit than customers who tend to wager lower amounts highend gaming is more volatile than other forms of gaming and variances in winloss results attributable to highend gaming may have a significant positive or negative impact on cash flow and earnings in a particular period we extend credit to those customers whose level of play and financial resources warrant in the opinion of management an extension of credit these large receivables could have a significant impact on our results of operations if deemed uncollectible gaming debts evidenced by a credit instrument including what is commonly referred to as a “marker” and judgments on gaming debts are enforceable under the current laws of the jurisdictions in which we allow play on a credit basis and judgments on gaming debts in such jurisdictions are enforceable in all us states under the full faith and credit clause of the us constitution however other jurisdictions may determine that enforcement of gaming debts is against public policy although courts of some foreign nations will enforce gaming debts directly and the assets in the us of foreign debtors may be reached to satisfy a judgment judgments on gaming debts from us courts are not binding on the courts of many foreign nations 

in addition in november 2017 the chinese government adopted new rules to control the crossborder transportation of cash and bearer negotiable instruments specifically to reduce the international transfer of cash in connection with activities that are illegal in china including gambling the chinese government has recently taken steps to prohibit the transfer of cash for the payment of gaming debts these developments may have the effect of reducing the collectability of gaming debts of players from china it is unclear whether these and other measures will continue to be in effect or become more restrictive in the future these and any future foreign currency control policy developments that may be implemented by foreign jurisdictions could significantly impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

acts of terrorism war natural disasters severe weather and political economic and military conditions may impede our ability to operate or may negatively impact our financial results 

terrorist attacks and other acts of war or hostility have created many economic and political uncertainties for example a substantial number of the customers of our properties in las vegas use air travel as a result of terrorist acts that occurred on september 11 2001 domestic and international travel was severely disrupted which resulted in a decrease in customer visits to our properties in las vegas visitation to las vegas also declined for a period of time following the mass shooting tragedy on october 1 2017 we cannot predict the extent to which disruptions in air or other forms of travel as a result of any further terrorist act security alerts or war uprisings or hostilities in places such as iraq afghanistan ukraine andor syria or other countries throughout the world and governmental responses to those acts or hostilities will directly or indirectly impact our business and operating results for example our operations in cairo egypt were negatively affected from the uprising there in january 2011 a third party that is responsible for our player account management has employees in ukraine and negative developments in ukraine could negatively impact our digital business as a consequence of the threat of terrorist attacks and other acts of war or hostility in the future premiums for a variety of insurance products have increased and some types of insurance are no longer available if any such event were to affect our properties we would likely be adversely affected 

in addition natural and manmade disasters such as major fires floods severe snowstorms hurricanes earthquakes and oil spills could also adversely impact our business and operating results such events could lead to the loss of use of one or more of our properties for an extended period of time and disrupt our ability to attract customers to certain of our gaming facilities for example our property in lake charles louisiana has been closed since august 27 2020 due to damage resulting from hurricane laura inadequate insurance or lack of available insurance for these and other certain types or levels of risk could expose us to significant losses in the event that a catastrophe occurred for which we are underinsured in most cases we have insurance that covers portions of any losses from a natural disaster but it is subject to deductibles and maximum payouts in many cases although we may be covered by insurance from a natural disaster the timing of our receipt of insurance proceeds 

if any may be out of our control in some cases however we may receive no proceeds from insurance further if properties subject to our leases with vici and glpi are impacted by a casualty event such leases require us to repair or restore the affected properties even if the cost of such repair or restoration exceeds the insurance proceeds that we receive under such circumstances the rent under such leases is required to be paid during the period of repair or restoration even if all or a portion of the affected property is not operating in addition to the damage caused to our properties by a casualty loss we may suffer business disruption as a result of the casualty event or be subject to claims by third parties that may be injured or harmed while we carry general liability insurance and business interruption insurance there can be no assurance that insurance will be available or adequate to cover all loss and damage to which our business or our assets might be subjected and the timing and receipt of insurance proceeds if any may be out of our control 

our business may be subject to fluctuations due to seasonality and other factors that could result in volatility and have an adverse effect on our operating results 

our business may fluctuate due to seasonality and other factors our casino business is impacted by weather conditions that may deter or prevent customers from reaching the facilities or undertaking trips which would particularly affect customers who are traveling longer distances to visit our properties our casino business can also fluctuate due to specific holidays or other significant events such as easter particularly when the holiday falls in a different quarter than the prior year the world series of poker tournament with respect to our las vegas properties citywide conventions a large sporting event or a concert or visits by our premium players our sportsbook business may also be impacted by availability or scheduling of major sporting events or the cancellation or postponement of sporting events or races including lockouts strikes or similar disruptions for example our sports betting business could be adversely impacted if the 2022 major league baseball season does not begin on time or does not occur at all seasonality holiday or other significant events may affect our digital operations properties or regions differently these factors among other things could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results cause volatility in the trading price of our stock and impact our cash flow from quarter to quarter 

our business is particularly sensitive to energy prices and a rise in energy prices could harm our operating results 

we are a large consumer of electricity and other energy and therefore higher energy prices may have an adverse effect on our results of operations accordingly increases in energy costs may have a negative impact on our operating results additionally higher electricity and gasoline prices that affect our customers may result in reduced visitation to our resorts and a reduction in our revenues we may be indirectly impacted by regulatory requirements aimed at reducing the impacts of climate change directed at upstream utility providers as we could experience potentially higher utility fuel and transportation costs 

any deterioration in our reputation or the reputation of our brands could adversely impact our business financial condition or results of operations 

our business is dependent on the quality and reputation of our company and brands events beyond our control could affect the reputation of one or more of our properties including our digital operations or more generally impact our corporate or brand image other factors that could influence our reputation include the quality of the services we offer and our actions with regard to social issues such as diversity human rights and support for local communities broad access to social media makes it easy for anyone to provide public feedback that can influence perceptions of us our brands or our properties it may be difficult to control or effectively manage negative publicity regardless of whether it is accurate negative events and publicity could quickly and materially damage perceptions of us our brands or our properties which in turn could adversely impact our business financial condition or results of operations through loss of customers loss of business opportunities lack of acceptance of our company to operate in host communities employee retention or recruiting difficulties or other difficulties 

risks relating to information systems and technology 

compromises of our information systems or unauthorized access to confidential information or our customers’ personal information could materially harm our reputation and business 

we collect and store confidential personal information relating to our customers for various business purposes including marketing and financial purposes and credit card information for processing payments for example we handle collect and store personal information in connection with our customers staying at our hotels and enrolling in caesars rewards we may share this personal and confidential information with vendors or other third parties in connection with processing of transactions operating certain aspects of our business or for marketing purposes our collection and use of personal data are governed by state and federal privacy laws and regulations as well as the applicable laws and regulations in other countries in which we operate privacy law is subject to frequent changes and varies significantly by jurisdiction we may incur significant costs in order to ensure compliance with the various applicable privacy requirements in addition privacy laws and regulations may limit our ability to market to our customers 

we assess and monitor the security of collection storage and transmission of customer information on an ongoing basis we utilize commercially available software and technologies to monitor assess and secure our network further some of the systems currently used for transmission and approval of payment card transactions and the technology utilized in payment cards themselves all of which can put payment card data at risk are determined and controlled by the payment card industry and other such systems are determined and controlled by us although we have taken steps designed to safeguard our customers’ confidential personal information and important internal company data our network and other systems and those of third parties such as service providers could be compromised damaged or disrupted by a thirdparty breach of our system security or that of a thirdparty provider or as a result of purposeful or accidental actions of third parties our employees or those employees of a third party power outages computer viruses system failures natural disasters or other catastrophic events our thirdparty information system service providers face risks relating to cybersecurity similar to ours and we do not directly control any of such parties’ information security operations advances in computer and software capabilities encryption technology new tools and other developments may increase the risk of a security breach as a result of any security breach customer information or other proprietary data may be accessed or transmitted by or to a third party despite the measures we have implemented to safeguard our information there can be no assurance that we are adequately protecting our information 

any loss disclosure of misappropriation of or access to customers’ or other proprietary information or other breach of our information security could result in legal claims or legal proceedings including regulatory investigations and actions or liability for failure to comply with privacy and information security laws including for failure to protect personal information or for misusing personal information which could disrupt our operations damage our reputation and expose us to claims from customers financial institutions regulators payment card associations employees and other persons any of which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

we have cybersecurity insurance to respond to a breach which is designed to cover expenses around notification credit monitoring investigation crisis management public relations and legal advice we also carry other insurance which may cover ancillary aspects of the event however damage and claims arising from a breach may not be completely covered or may exceed the amount of any insurance available 

our operations and particularly our digital betting and gaming operations are reliant on information technology and other systems and services and any failures errors defects or disruptions in our systems or services could adversely affect our operations 

our technology infrastructure is critical to the performance of our digital betting and gaming operations and to user satisfaction and we rely significantly on our computer systems and software to receive and properly process internal and external data including data related to caesars rewards we devote significant resources to our technology infrastructure but our systems may not be adequate to avoid performance delays or outages that could be harmful to our online business in addition we cannot assure you that the measures we take to prevent cyberattacks and protect our systems data and user information and to prevent outages data or information loss fraud and to prevent or detect security breaches will be sufficient to ensure uninterrupted operation of our digital platform and provide absolute security we have experienced and we may in the future experience website disruptions outages and other performance problems due to a variety of factors including infrastructure changes human or software errors and capacity constraints disruptions from unauthorized access to fraudulent manipulation of or tampering with our computer systems and technological infrastructure or those of third parties that provide support to our operations could result in a wide range of negative outcomes each of which could materially adversely affect the operation of our online business and our financial condition results of operations and prospects 

additionally our computer systems and software may fail or may contain errors bugs flaws or corrupted data and these defects may only become apparent after the launch of our online products these types of issues could disrupt our operations or render a product unavailable when users attempt to access it or cause access to our offerings to be slower than our users expect inaccessibility or slow access to our products could make users less likely to return to our digital platform as often if at all or to recommend our offerings to other potential users which could harm our brand perception cause our users to stop utilizing our online offerings divert our resources and delay market acceptance of our online offerings 

we expect that we will continue to expand our online betting and gaming offerings as our user base grows and we enter into new markets which will require an enhancement of our technical infrastructure including network capacity and computing power to support the growth of our digital business and to satisfy our users’ needs such infrastructure expansion may be complex and costly and unanticipated delays in completing these projects or availability of components may lead to increased project costs operational inefficiencies or interruptions in the delivery or degradation of the quality of our offerings in addition there may be issues related to our online infrastructure that are not identified during the testing phases of design and implementation and become evident after we have started to fully use the underlying equipment or software which could impact the user experience or increase our costs an inability to effectively scale our technical infrastructure to accommodate increased demands could adversely impact our ability to grow our digital betting and gaming business 

our online business is dependent on the internet and we rely on amazon web services and other thirdparty technology platforms and services to deliver our offerings to users 

a substantial portion of the infrastructure that is required to enable users to access our digital betting and gaming offerings is provided by third parties including internet service providers and other technologybased service providers in particular we currently host our online betting and gaming offerings and support our operations using amazon web services “aws” and other thirdparty technology platforms and services our thirdparty providers may experience service interruptions delays outages or damage including due to capacity constraints an event causing an unusually high volume of internet use such as a pandemic or public health emergency infrastructure changes or upgrades such as 5g or 6g services human or software errors website hosting disruptions natural disasters cybersecurity attacks terrorist attacks power outages and similar events or acts of misconduct we exercise little control over our thirdparty providers and any difficulties that these providers experience including the potential of certain network traffic receiving priority over other traffic ie lack of net neutrality may adversely affect our business because our ability to provide our users with continuing and uninterrupted access to our platform is critical to the success of our digital business we use our best efforts to ensure that our facilities and infrastructure and the facilities and infrastructure of our thirdparty providers support our current and expected operations and are designed to mitigate the impacts of system malfunctions nevertheless there can be no guarantee that such systems will be able to meet the demand of our current and future digital business the overall online betting and gaming industry and the growth of the internet furthermore if we do not maintain business relationships with our thirdparty providers and in particular aws we may not be able to secure required thirdparty services on terms that are acceptable to us or on an acceptable time frame any of these risks could result in a loss of revenue and cause us to incur unexpected costs that could be significant which could have a material adverse effect on our online business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

our online business model depends upon the continued compatibility between our apps and the major mobile operating systems and upon thirdparty platforms for the distribution of our product offerings which depend on factors beyond our control such as the design of thirdparty operating systems and continued access to our apps on thirdparty distribution platforms like the apple app store 

our digital business is dependent on the interoperability of our technology with popular mobile operating systems technologies networks and standards as our users access our online betting and gaming product offerings primarily on mobile devices as a result our business model depends upon the continued compatibility between our app and the major mobile operating systems such as the android and ios operating systems and we rely upon thirdparty platforms for distribution of our product offerings we do not have formal or informal relationships with parties that control design of mobile devices and operating systems and there is no guarantee that popular mobile devices will start or continue to support or feature our product offerings any changes bugs technical or regulatory issues in such operating systems our relationships with mobile manufacturers and carriers or in their terms of service or policies that degrade our offerings’ functionality reduce or eliminate our ability to distribute our offerings give preferential treatment to competitive products limit our ability to deliver high quality offerings or impose fees or other charges related to delivering our offerings could adversely affect our product usage and monetization on mobile devices in addition if any of the thirdparty platforms used for distribution of our product offerings were to limit or disable the availability of our app or advertising on their platforms our ability to generate revenue could be harmed these changes could materially impact the way we do business and if we are unable to adjust to those changes quickly and effectively there could be an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

risks related to human capital 

we rely on our key personnel and we may face difficulties in attracting and retaining qualified employees for our casinos and race tracks 

our future success will depend upon among other things our ability to keep our senior executives and highly qualified employees the operation of our business requires qualified executives managers and skilled employees with gaming and horse racing industry experience and qualifications who are able to obtain the requisite licenses and approval from the applicable gaming authorities we compete with other potential employers for employees and we may not succeed in hiring or retaining the executives and other employees that we need a sudden loss of or inability to replace key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations moreover there has from time to time been a shortage of skilled labor in our markets and the continued expansion of gaming near our facilities including the expansion of native american gaming and internet betting and gaming may make it more difficult for us to attract qualified candidates while we believe that we will continue to be able to attract and retain qualified employees shortages of skilled labor will make it increasingly difficult and expensive to attract and retain the services of a satisfactory number of qualified employees and we may incur higher costs than expected as a result 

work stoppages and other labor problems could negatively impact our future profits 

as of december 31 2021 we had collective bargaining agreements covering approximately 23000 employees a lengthy strike or other work stoppages at any of our casino properties could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

from time to time we have also experienced attempts by labor organizations to organize certain of our nonunion employees these efforts have achieved some success to date we cannot provide any assurance that we will not experience additional and successful union activity in the future the impact of this union activity is undetermined and could negatively impact our results of operations 

we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our performers and other entertainment offerings on acceptable terms or at all 

historically our performers have drawn customers to our properties and have been a significant source of our revenue we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our performers or other shows on acceptable terms or at all in addition the third parties that we depend on for our properties’ entertainment offerings may become incapable or unwilling to provide their services at the level agreed upon or at all disruptions in the performance schedule can leave us without entertainment offerings which could negatively impact our business 

risks relating to our capital structure 

our substantial indebtedness and the fact that a significant portion of our cash flow is used to make interest payments and rent payments under our debt and lease agreements could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry and prevent us from making debt service payments and rent payments 

as of december 31 2021 we had 143 billion of outstanding indebtedness in addition to leases with vici and glpi that require an annual rent payment of 12 billion in 2022 and that are subject to annual escalation see note 10 for a description of our obligations under our leases with vici and glpi and note 12 for details regarding our debt outstanding and related restrictive covenants as a result a significant portion of our cash flow is applied to make interest payments with respect to our outstanding debt and payments under our leases these financial obligations may have important negative consequences for us including 

• limiting our ability to use operating cash flow in other areas of our business because we must dedicate a significant portion of these funds to make payments on our debt and lease obligations 

• limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our businesses and the markets in which we operate 

• placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors with debt and rent obligations that are less than ours 

• increasing our vulnerability to and limiting our ability to react to changing market conditions covid19 and other public health emergencies changes in our industry and economic downturns 

• limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund working capital requirements capital expenditures debt service acquisitions general corporate or other obligations 

• subjecting us to a number of restrictive covenants that among other things require us to make capital expenditures and limit our ability to pay dividends and distributions make acquisitions and dispositions borrow additional funds and make other investments 

• exposing us to interest rate risk due to the variable interest rate on borrowings under our credit facilities and 

• affecting our ability to renew gaming and other licenses necessary to conduct our business 

certain of our debt facilities including the crc revolving credit facility mature in 2022 while we expect to refinance or replace our debt facilities when they mature we cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain financing on commercially reasonable terms 

despite our current indebtedness levels we and our subsidiaries may still incur significant additional indebtedness incurring more indebtedness could increase the risks associated with our substantial indebtedness 

we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness including additional secured indebtedness and may enter into financing obligations similar to our leases with vici and glpi in the future as of december 31 2021 we had 20 billion of borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facilities before consideration of 23 million in outstanding letters of credit and 48 million committed for regulatory purposes under our cei revolving credit facility and 69 million in outstanding letters of credit under our crc revolving credit facility further our existing debt agreements currently permit 

and we expect that agreements governing debt that we incur in the future will permit us to incur certain other additional secured and unsecured debt further we may incur other liabilities that do not constitute indebtedness the risks that we face based on our outstanding indebtedness may intensify if we incur additional indebtedness or financing obligations in the future 

our variable rate indebtedness exposes us to interest rate volatility which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly 

borrowings under certain of our facilities are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate volatility if interest rates increase our debt service obligations on certain of our variable rate indebtedness will increase even though the amount borrowed remains the same in addition at the end of 2021 the administrator for london interbank offered rate “libor” ceased publishing oneweek and twomonth us dollar libor and will cease publishing all remaining us dollar libor tenors in mid2023 concurrently the united kingdom’s financial conduct authority announced the cessation or loss of representativeness of the us dollar libor tenors from those dates while we continue to monitor market developments to assess replacement rate options the consequences of these developments with respect to libor cannot be entirely predicted and may result in the level of interest payments on the portion of our indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates to be affected which may adversely impact the amount of our interest payments under such debt 

a significant portion of our casinos are located on leased property if we default on one or more leases the applicable lessors could terminate the affected leases and we could lose possession of the affected casino 

we currently lease certain parcels of land on which a significant portion of our properties are located as a ground lessee we have the right to use the leased land however we do not hold fee ownership of the underlying land accordingly we have no interest in the leased land or improvements thereon at the expiration of the ground leases if our use of the land underlying our casino properties is disrupted permanently or for a significant period of time then the value of our assets could be impaired and our business and operations could be adversely affected our leases provide that they may be terminated for a number of reasons including failure to pay rent taxes or other payment obligations or the breach of other covenants contained in the leases in particular our leases with glpi and vici require annual rent payments of 12 billion in 2022 which is subject to escalation annually and obligate us to make specified minimum capital expenditures with respect to the leased properties if our business and properties fail to generate sufficient earnings the payments required to service the rent obligations under our leases with glpi and vici could materially and adversely limit our ability to react to changes in our business and make acquisitions and investments in our properties if we were to default on any one or more of these leases the applicable lessors could terminate the affected leases and we could lose possession of the affected land and any improvements on the land including the hotels and casinos a termination of our ground leases or our leases with glpi or vici could result in a default under our debt agreements and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations further in the event that any lessor of our leased properties including glpi or vici encounters financial operational regulatory or other challenges there can be no assurance that such lessor will be able to comply with its obligations under the applicable lease 

certain of our leases including our leases with glpi and vici are “triplenet” leases accordingly in addition to rent we are required to pay among other things the following 1 lease payments to the underlying ground lessor for properties that are subject to ground leases 2 facility maintenance costs 3 all insurance premiums for insurance with respect to the leased properties and the business conducted on the leased properties 4 taxes levied on or with respect to the leased properties other than taxes on the income of the lessor and 5 all utilities and other services necessary or appropriate for the leased properties and the business conducted on the leased properties we are responsible for incurring the costs described in the preceding sentence notwithstanding the fact that many of the benefits received in exchange for such costs shall in part accrue to the lessor as the owner of the associated facilities in addition we remain obligated for lease payments and other obligations under our leases with glpi and vici and other ground leases even if one or more of such leased facilities is unprofitable or if we decide to withdraw from those locations we could incur special charges relating to the closing of such facilities including lease termination costs impairment charges and other special charges that would reduce our net income and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

legal and regulatory risks 

we are subject to extensive governmental regulation taxation policies and licensing and gaming authorities have significant control over our operations which could have an adverse effect on our business 

licensing requirements  the ownership and operation of casino gaming online betting and gaming riverboat and horse racing facilities are subject to extensive federal state and local regulation and regulatory authorities at local state and national levels have broad powers with respect to the licensing of gaming businesses we currently hold all state and local licenses and related approvals necessary to conduct our present gaming operations but we must periodically apply to renew many of our licenses and registrations we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such renewals any failure to maintain or renew our 

existing licenses registrations permits or approvals would have a material adverse effect on us in addition we are required to provide information relating to our operations to various gaming regulatory agencies a failure to provide accurate information could result in the imposition of fines or other penalties by the relevant regulatory authority furthermore if additional laws or regulations are adopted or existing laws or regulations are amended or interpreted differently these regulations could impose additional restrictions or costs that could have a significant adverse effect on us 

gaming authorities with jurisdiction over our operations may in their discretion require the holder of any securities issued by us to file applications be investigated and be found suitable to own our securities and if a holder is found unsuitable we can be sanctioned including the loss of approvals that are required for us to continue our gaming operations in the relevant jurisdictions if such unsuitable person does not timely sell our securities our officers directors and key employees are also subject to similar findings of unsuitability and the gaming authorities may require us to terminate the employment of any person who refuses to file appropriate applications see “item 1  gaming licenses and governmental regulations” and exhibit 991 for further description of the regulations to which we are subject we may be required under applicable gaming laws and regulations to obtain approval of applicable gaming authorities to issue securities incur debt and undertake other financing activities and our financing counterparties including lenders might be subject to various licensing and related approval procedures in the various jurisdictions in which we operate gaming facilities 

compliance with other laws  we are also subject to a variety of other federal state and local laws rules regulations and ordinances that apply to nongaming businesses including restrictions enacted in response to covd19 zoning environmental construction and landuse laws and regulations governing smoking and the serving of alcoholic beverages our operations have been adversely impacted by regulations enacted to limit the spread of covid19 in addition legislation in various forms to ban indoor tobacco smoking has been enacted or introduced in many states and local jurisdictions including several of the jurisdictions in which we operate if additional restrictions are enacted in our jurisdictions we could experience a significant decrease in gaming revenue and operating results at our properties and particularly if such restrictions are not applicable to all competitive facilities in that gaming market our business could be materially adversely affected the likelihood or outcome of similar legislation in other jurisdictions and referendums in the future cannot be predicted though any additional limitations on our operations would be expected to negatively impact our financial performance 

regulations adopted by fincen require us to report currency transactions in excess of 10000 occurring within a gaming day us treasury department regulations also require us to report certain suspicious activity including any transaction that exceeds 5000 if we know suspect or have reason to believe that the transaction involves funds from illegal activity or is designed to evade federal regulations or reporting requirements substantial penalties can be imposed if we fail to comply with these regulations fincen has recently increased its focus on gaming companies 

we are required to report certain customer’s gambling winnings via form w2g to comply with current internal revenue service regulations should these regulations change we would expect to incur additional costs to comply with the revised reporting requirements 

taxation and fees  in addition gaming companies are generally subject to significant revenuebased taxes and fees in addition to normal federal state and local income taxes and such taxes and fees are subject to increase at any time we pay substantial taxes and fees with respect to our operations tax laws are dynamic and subject to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of the law are issued or applied affecting the gaming industry the large number of state and local governments with significant current or projected budget deficits makes it more likely that those governments that currently permit gaming will seek to fund such deficits with new or increased gaming taxes andor property taxes and worsening economic conditions could intensify those efforts any material increase or the adoption of additional taxes or fees could have a material adverse effect on our future financial results 

the growth of our online betting and gaming business will depend on expansion of online betting and gaming into new jurisdictions and our ability to obtain required licenses 

our ability to achieve growth in our online betting and gaming business will depend in large part upon expansion of online betting and gaming into new jurisdictions the terms of regulations relating to online betting and gaming and our ability to obtain required licenses following the 2018 decision of the us supreme court to overturn the federal ban on sports betting a number of jurisdictions have legalized sports betting and online gaming and we expect that additional jurisdictions may do so in the future our ability to further expand our sports betting and online operations is dependent on the adoption of regulations permitting such activities however the expansion of betting and online gaming in new jurisdictions is dependent on a number of factors that are beyond our control and there can be no assurances of when or if such regulations will be adopted or the terms of such regulations including restrictions tax rates and license fees and availability of such licenses to casino owners exclusively or at all 

we may not be able to protect the intellectual property rights we own or may be prevented from using intellectual property necessary for our business 

the development of intellectual property is part of our overall business strategy and we regard our intellectual property to be an important element of our success we rely primarily on trade secret trademark domain name copyright and contract law to protect the intellectual property and proprietary technology we own we also actively pursue business opportunities in the united states and in international jurisdictions involving the licensing of our trademarks to third parties it is possible that third parties may copy or otherwise obtain and use our intellectual property or proprietary technology without authorization or otherwise infringe on our rights for example while we have a policy of entering into confidentiality intellectual property invention assignment andor noncompetition and nonsolicitation agreements or restrictions with our employees independent contractors and business partners such agreements may not provide adequate protection or may be breached or our proprietary technology may otherwise become available to or be independently developed by our competitors in addition the laws of some foreign countries may not protect proprietary rights or intellectual property to as great an extent as do the laws of the united states despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights the unauthorized use or reproduction of our trademarks could diminish the value of our trademarks and our market acceptance competitive advantages or goodwill which could adversely affect our business 

our technology contains software modules licensed to us by thirdparty authors under “open source” licenses use and distribution of open source software may entail greater risks than use of thirdparty commercial software as open source licensors generally do not provide support warranties indemnification or other contractual protections regarding infringement claims or the quality of the code in addition the public availability of such software may make it easier for others to compromise our technology and under certain open source licenses we could be required to release the source code of our proprietary software to the public this would allow our competitors to create similar offerings with lower development effort and time and ultimately could result in a loss of our competitive advantages 

third parties have alleged and may in the future allege that we are infringing misappropriating or otherwise violating their intellectual property rights third parties may initiate litigation against us without warning or may send us letters or other communications that make allegations without initiating litigation we may elect not to respond to these letters or other communications if we believe they are without merit or we may attempt to resolve these disputes out of court by negotiating a license but in either case it is possible that such disputes will ultimately result in litigation any such claims could interfere with our ability to use technology or intellectual property that is material to the operation of our business such claims may be made by competitors seeking to obtain a competitive advantage or by other parties such as entities that purchase intellectual property assets for the purpose of bringing infringement claims we also periodically employ individuals who were previously employed by our competitors or potential competitors and we may therefore be subject to claims that such employees have used or disclosed the alleged trade secrets or other proprietary information of their former employers 

we may have to rely on litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights protect our trade secrets determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or defend against claims of infringement or invalidity including with respect to technology that we believe to be “open source” any such litigation could result in substantial costs and the diversion of resources and the attention of management if unsuccessful such litigation could result in the loss of important intellectual property rights require us to pay substantial damages subject us to injunctions that prevent us from using certain intellectual property require us to make admissions that affect our reputation in the marketplace or require us to enter into license agreements that may not be available on favorable terms reengineer our technology or discontinue or delay the provision of our offerings finally even if we prevail in any litigation the remedy may not be commercially meaningful or fully compensate us for the harm we suffer or the costs we incur any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we rely on licenses to use the intellectual property rights of third parties which are incorporated into our products and services failure to renew or expand existing licenses may require us to modify limit or discontinue certain offerings 

we rely on products technologies and intellectual property that we license from third parties for use in our businesstobusiness and businesstoconsumers offerings certain of our offerings and services use intellectual property licensed from third parties and we expect that our future products will require the use of thirdparty intellectual property the future success of our business may depend in part on our ability to obtain retain andor expand licenses for popular technologies and games in a competitive market we cannot assure that thirdparty licenses that may be necessary or desirable for the operation of our products or support for such licensed products and technologies will be available to us on commercially reasonable terms if at all if we are unable to renew andor expand existing licenses or obtain new licenses including as a result of reluctance of third parties to subject themselves to regulatory review that may be required to operate as our supplier we may be required to discontinue or limit our use of the products that include or incorporate the licensed intellectual property which could adversely impact our business results of operations and prospects 

we are or may become involved in legal proceedings that if adversely adjudicated or settled could impact our business and financial condition 

from time to time we are named in lawsuits or other legal proceedings relating to our respective businesses some of these matters involve commercial or contractual disputes intellectual property claims legal compliance personal injury claims and employment claims as with all legal proceedings no assurances can be given as to the outcome of these matters moreover legal proceedings can be expensive and time consuming and we may not be successful in defending or prosecuting these lawsuits which could result in settlements or damages that could significantly impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

we cannot be sure that we will be able to dispose of the william hill nonus operations on terms and conditions that are satisfactory to us or at all 

we previously announced that on september 9 2021 we entered into an agreement to sell the william hill international operations to 888 holdings plc “888” and that we intend to apply the proceeds of such sale to repay outstanding indebtedness the transaction remains subject to the satisfaction of a number of conditions most notably 888’s publication of a prospectus and shareholder circular recommending shareholder approval of the transaction and receipt of that approval from 888’s shareholders there can be no assurance that the transaction will be completed on the previously agreed upon terms and timeline or that we will be able to consummate a sale of william hill international in the near future or at all if we do not expect the closing of the sale of william hill international by october 14 2022 the date in which the bridge credit agreement matures we expect to refinance the outstanding indebtedness under the bridge credit agreement we cannot guarantee the success of such refinancing

critical accounting policies and estimates 

we prepare our financial statements in conformity with gaap in preparing our financial statements we have made our best estimates and judgments of the amounts and disclosures included in the financial statements giving regard to materiality when more than one accounting principle or method of its application is generally accepted we select the principle or method that we consider to be the most appropriate under specific circumstances application of these accounting principles requires us to make estimates about the future resolution of existing uncertainties certain of our accounting policies including those in connection with business combinations certain fair value measurements income taxes longlived assets goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets allowance for doubtful accounts related to certain gaming receivables selfinsurance reserves and litigation claims and assessments require that we apply significant judgment in defining the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 

we consider accounting estimates to be critical accounting policies when 

• the estimates involve matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made and 

• different estimates or changes to estimates could have a material impact on the reported financial position changes in financial position or results of operations 

by their nature these judgments and estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty our judgments and estimates are based on our historical experience terms of existing contracts observance of trends in the industry information gathered from customer behavior and information available from other outside sources as appropriate due to the inherent uncertainty involving judgments and estimates actual results may differ from those estimates 

our most critical accounting estimates and assumptions are in the following areas 

business combinations 

we applied the provisions of accounting standards codification “asc” topic 805 “business combinations” in the accounting for our acquisitions of former caesars william hill plc and our additional interest in horseshoe baltimore it required us to recognize the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair values which were determined using market income and cost approaches or a combination goodwill as of the respective acquisition dates was measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed goodwill is generally the result of expected synergies of the combined company or an assembled workforce 

indefinitelived intangible assets acquired primarily include trademarks caesars rewards acquired in the merger customer relationships and gaming rights the fair value for these intangible assets was determined using either the relief from royalty method and excess earnings method under the income approach or a replacement cost market approach 

acquired trademarks developed technology and caesars rewards were valued using the relief from royalty method which presumes that without ownership of such trademarks technology or loyalty program we would have to make a stream of 

payments to a third party in return for the right to use their name technology or program by virtue of this asset we avoid any such payments and record the related intangible value of the company’s ownership of the brand name technology or program 

customer relationships were valued using the cost approach and the incremental cash flow method under the income approach the incremental cash flow method compares the prospective cash flows with and without the customer relationships in place to estimate the fair value of the customer relationships with the fair value assumed to be equal to the discounted cash flows of the business that would be lost if the customer relationships were not in place and needed to be replaced 

gaming rights include our gaming licenses in various jurisdictions and may have indefinite lives or an estimated useful life the fair value of the gaming rights was determined using the excess earnings or replacement cost methodology based on whether the license resides in gaming jurisdictions where competition is limited to a specified number of licensed gaming operators the excess earnings methodology is an income approach that estimates the projected cash flows of the business attributable to the gaming license intangible asset which is net of charges for the use of other identifiable assets of the business including working capital fixed assets and other intangible assets the replacement cost of the gaming license was used as an indicator of fair value 

trade receivables and payables and other current and noncurrent assets and liabilities were valued at the existing carrying values as they represented the estimated fair value of those items at the acquisition date assets and liabilities held for sale are recorded at fair value less costs to sell based on the agreements reached as of the acquisition date or an income approach 

the fair value of the financing obligations were calculated as the net present value of both the fixed base rent payments and the forecasted variable payments plus the expected residual value of the land and building returned at the end of the expected usage period 

reacquired rights were valued using the excess earnings method that reflects the present value of the future profit william hill expected to earn over the remaining term of the contract adjusted for returns of other assets that contribute to the generation of this profit such as working capital fixed assets and other intangible assets the forecasted profit used within the valuation was adjusted for the settlement of the preexisting relationship as a component of the purchase consideration 

fair value of land was determined using the sales comparable approach the market data is then adjusted for any significant differences to the extent known between the identified comparable sites and the site being valued the value of building and site improvements was estimated via the income approach other personal property assets such as furniture gaming and computer equipment fixtures computer software and restaurant equipment were valued using the cost approach which is based on replacement or reproduction costs of the asset the cost approach is an estimation of fair value developed by computing the current cost of replacing a property and subtracting any depreciation resulting from one or more of the following factors physical deterioration functional obsolescence andor economic obsolescence 

assets and liabilities which are designated as held for sale on an acquisition date are also measured at fair value utilizing similar market income and cost approaches described above based on the underlying asset class held for sale 

cash flow estimates are significant to many valuations described above and may include forecasts with assumptions regarding factors such as recent and budgeted operating performance future growth rates and the determination of appropriate discount rates to estimate fair value these inputs involve significant assumptions including the future effects of covid19 as well as the realization of synergies anticipated from a business combination which may not be realized as projected certain assumptions such as the effects of covid19 may be beyond our control 

fair value measurements 

we use interest rate swaps which are derivative instruments classified as hedging transactions to limit our exposure to interest rate risk derivative instruments are recognized in the financial statements at fair value the estimated fair values of our derivative instruments are based on market prices obtained from dealer quotes such quotes represent the estimated amounts we would receive or pay to terminate the contracts our derivative instruments contain a credit risk that the counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the agreements we minimize that risk by evaluating the creditworthiness of our counterparties which are limited to major banks and financial institutions the fair values of our derivative instruments are adjusted for the credit rating of the counterparty if the derivative is an asset or adjusted for the credit rating of the company if the derivative is a liability 

see note 8 for more details regarding fair value measurements and item 7a for quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

income taxes 

we and our subsidiaries file income tax returns with federal state and foreign jurisdictions our income tax returns are subject to examination by the internal revenue service “irs” and other tax authorities positions taken in tax returns are sometimes subject to uncertainty in the tax laws and may not ultimately be accepted by the irs or other tax authorities see note 17 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the status and impact of examinations by tax authorities 

we record income taxes under the asset and liability method whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and as attributable to operating loss and tax credit carryforwards we reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if based on the available evidence it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized accordingly the need to establish valuation allowances for deferred tax assets is assessed periodically based on the “more likely than not” realization threshold this assessment considers among other matters the nature frequency and severity of current and cumulative losses forecasts of future profitability the duration of statutory carryforward periods our experience with operating loss and tax credit carryforwards not expiring unused and tax planning alternatives 

when there is a recent history of operating losses and negative normalized earnings and a return to operating profitability has not yet been demonstrated we cannot rely on projections of future taxable earnings for purposes of assessing recoverability of our deferred tax assets in such cases we use systematic and logical methods to estimate when deferred tax liabilities will reverse and generate taxable income and when deferred tax assets will reverse and generate tax deductions our most significant deferred tax asset relates to the failed saleleaseback obligation with vici and glpi see note 10 the reversal of this deferred tax asset requires judgment and estimates and has a material impact on the determination of the amount of valuation allowance required 

under the applicable accounting standards we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is morelikelythannot that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement the accounting standards also provide guidance on derecognition classification interest and penalties on income taxes accounting in interim periods and disclosure requirements for uncertain tax positions 

longlived assets 

we have significant capital invested in our longlived assets and judgments are made in determining the estimated useful lives of assets salvage values to be assigned to assets and if or when an asset has been impaired the accuracy of these estimates affects the amount of depreciation and amortization expense recognized in our financial results and whether we have a gain or loss on the disposal of an asset we assign lives to our assets based on our standard policy which is established by management as representative of the useful life of each category of asset we review the carrying value of our longlived assets whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition the factors considered by management in performing this assessment include current operating results trends and prospects planned construction and renovation projects as well as the effect of obsolescence demand competition and other economic legal and regulatory factors in estimating expected future cash flows for determining whether an asset is impaired assets are grouped at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows which for most of our assets is the individual property see note 6 for additional information 

goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets 

assessing goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment is a process that requires significant judgment and involves detailed qualitative and quantitative businessspecific analysis and many individual assumptions which fluctuate between assessments 

we determine the estimated fair value of each reporting unit based on a combination of ebitda valuation multiples and estimated future cash flows discounted at rates commensurate with the capital structure and cost of capital of comparable market participants giving appropriate consideration to the prevailing borrowing rates within the casino industry in general we also evaluate the aggregate fair value of all of our reporting units and other nonoperating assets in comparison to our aggregate debt and equity market capitalization at the test date ebitda multiples and discounted cash flows are common measures used to value businesses in our industry 

we determine the fair value of our indefinitelived intangible assets using either the relief from royalty method or the excess earnings method under the income approach or replacement cost market approach the determination of fair value of our 

reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets requires management to make significant assumptions and estimates around the forecasts as well as the selection of discount rates and valuation multiples changes in these estimates could have a significant impact on the fair value of our reporting units intangible assets and result in potential impairment 

forecasts and the determination of appropriate discount rates and valuation multiples used to determine the fair value of our reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets involves significant assumptions and estimates assumptions include those used to assess future effects of covid19 as well as the realization of synergies anticipated from acquisitions which may not be realized at the projected rate 

we acquired william hill plc on april 22 2021 and allocated the total purchase consideration transferred to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values and therefore the fair value of the acquired reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets do not significantly exceed their respective carrying values as of october 1 2021 one other reporting unit in the regional segment with goodwill totaling 420 million had a fair value that did not significantly exceed its respective carrying values to the extent gaming volumes deteriorate in the near future discount rates increase significantly or we do not meet our projected performance we may recognize further impairments and such impairments could be material in addition 352 million of goodwill within our regional segment is associated with reporting units with zero or negative carrying value see note 7 for additional information 

allowance for doubtful accounts  gaming 

we reserve an estimated amount for gaming receivables that may not be collected to reduce the company’s receivables to their net carrying amount methodologies for estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts range from specific reserves to various percentages applied to aged receivables historical collection rates are considered as are customer relationships in determining specific reserves as with many estimates management must make judgments about potential actions by third parties in establishing and evaluating our reserves for allowance for doubtful accounts as of december 31 2021 a 5 increase or decrease to the allowance determined based on a percentage of aged receivables would change the reserve by approximately 14 million 

selfinsurance reserves 

we are selfinsured for various levels of general liability employee medical insurance coverage and workers’ compensation coverage insurance claims and reserves include accruals of estimated settlements for known claims as well as accruals of estimates for claims incurred but not yet reported we utilize independent consultants to assist management in its determination of estimated insurance liabilities while the total cost of claims incurred depends on future developments in managements’ opinion recorded reserves are adequate to cover future claims payments selfinsurance reserves for employee medical claims workers’ compensations and general liability claims are included selfinsurance claims and reserves within accrued other liabilities on the balance sheets see note 9 

the assumptions including those related to the covid19 public health emergency utilized by our actuaries are subject to significant uncertainty and if outcomes differ from these assumptions or events develop or progress in a negative manner the company could experience a material adverse effect and additional liabilities may be recorded in the future 

litigation claims and assessments 

we utilize estimates for litigation claims and assessments these estimates are based on our knowledge and experience regarding current and past events as well as assumptions about future events if our assessment of such a matter should change we may have to change the estimates which may have an adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows actual results could differ from these estimates

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices such as interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily from variable rate longterm debt arrangements our exposure to foreign exchange risk is attributable to funds held in operating and escrow accounts as well as the previously announced sales price of william hill international which are denominated in british pounds gbp 

interest rate risk 

as of december 31 2021 the face value of our longterm debt was 143 billion including variablerate longterm borrowings of 66 billion no amounts were outstanding under our revolving credit facilities 

as a result of the merger we assumed former caesars’ interest rate swaps of which four interest rate swap agreements are currently in place to fix the interest rate on 13 billion of variable rate debt as a result net of these interest rate swaps 53 billion of debt remains subject to variable interest rates as of december 31 2021 for the term of the agreements see note 12 for additional information the difference to be paid or received under the terms of the interest rate swap agreements is accrued as interest rates change and recognized as an adjustment to interest expense as settlements occur changes in the variable interest rates to be received pursuant to the terms of the interest rate swap agreements will have a corresponding effect on future cash flows 

we do not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 

the table below provides information as of december 31 2021 about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates including the cash flows associated with amortization the notional amounts of interest rate derivative instruments and related weighted average interest rates principal amounts are used to calculate the payments to be exchanged under the related agreements and weighted average variable rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve as of december 31 2021 and should not be considered a predictor of actual future interest rates 



 

a these amounts represent the interest rate swap notional amounts that mature at the end of 2022 see note 12 for additional information 

as of december 31 2021 borrowings outstanding under our credit facilities were variablerate borrowings assuming a 100 basispoint increase in libor our annual interest cost would change by 53 million based on gross amounts outstanding at december 31 2021 

libor is expected to be discontinued by lending institutions after december 31 2021 for new debt agreements and after june 30 2023 no additional libor rates will be available we have variable rate debt instruments which are subject to libor interest rates plus a margin or base rate our crc credit facility contains alternative rates in the event that libor is no longer available the baltimore term loan has been amended and we intend to work with our lenders to ensure any transition away from libor will have minimal impact on our financial condition but can provide no assurances regarding the impact of the discontinuation of libor our interest rate swaps mature on december 31 2022 

foreign exchange rate risks 

t he company has entered into several foreign exchange forward contracts with third parties to hedge the risk of fluctuations in the foreign exchange rates between usd and gbp and to fix the exchange rate for a portion of the funds used in the william hill acquisition repayment of related debt and expected proceeds of the sale of the international operations the company entered into a foreign exchange forward contract to purchase £724 million at a contracted exchange rate which was settled on june 11 2021 and december 31 2021  as of december 31 2021 the company is contracted to sell a total of £790 million at fixed exchange rates these contracts are to hedge the risk of fluctuations in the foreign exchange rate related to a portion of the expected proceeds from the sale of william hill international the forward term of these contracts ends in march 2022

trends 

covid19 — the extent of the ongoing and future effects of the covid19 public health emergency on our business and the casino resort industry generally is uncertain but we expect that it will continue to have a significant impact on our business results of operations and financial condition the extent and duration of the impact of covid19 will ultimately depend on future developments including but not limited to the duration and severity of the outbreak business recovery trends restrictions on operations imposed by governmental authorities the potential for authorities reimposing stay at home orders or additional restrictions in response to continued developments with the covid19 public health emergency the efficacy and availability of vaccines our ability to adapt to evolving operating procedures the impact on consumer demand and discretionary spending the length of time it takes for demand to return and our ability to adjust our cost structures for the duration of the outbreak’s effect on our operations 

online betting and gaming — online betting and gaming is a rapidly developing sector of the ecommerce industry and we believe the digital segment of the global betting and gaming industry will continue to grow in popularity and consumer confidence the market for online betting platforms is being driven by increased use of digital processes and global growing bettor demand we anticipate that the united states market will begin to have a strong and steady uptake in active wagers as statebystate legislation in the united states continues to evolve in response to recent legislation resulting in new opportunities in the united states sports betting market the extent and future effects of online betting and gaming on our casino properties is uncertain but we expect that our online betting and gaming offering will be complementary to our brickandmortar casino business 

competition 

the casino entertainment business is highly competitive the industry is comprised of a diverse group of competitors that vary considerably in size and geographic diversity quality of facilities and amenities available marketing and growth strategies and financial condition in most regions we compete directly with other casino facilities operating in the immediate and surrounding areas in las vegas our largest jurisdiction competition is expected to increase in the coming years for example the genting group is developing a casino and hotel called resorts world las vegas which is expected to open in summer 2021 it is located on the northern end of the las vegas strip in response to changing trends las vegas operators have been focused on expanding their nongaming offerings including upgrades to hotel rooms new food and beverage offerings and new entertainment offerings there have also been proposals for other large scale nongaming development projects in las vegas by various other developers our las vegas strip hotels and casinos also compete in part with each other 

in recent years many casino operators including us have been reinvesting in existing facilities developing or rebranding new casinos or complementary facilities and acquiring established facilities these reinvestment and expansion efforts combined with aggressive marketing strategies by us and many of our competitors have resulted in increased competition in many regions as companies have completed new expansion projects supply has grown at a faster pace than demand in some areas the expansion of properties and entertainment venues into new jurisdictions also presents competitive issues atlantic city in particular has experienced significant competitive pressure primarily due to the addition of gaming and room capacity associated with the expansion of gaming in maryland new york and pennsylvania as well as the opening of new properties this has resulted in several casino closings in recent years other examples of expected increases in competition in the markets include the recent legalization of casinos at licensed horse race tracks in nebraska in november 2020 and the opening of live casino and hotel philadelphia in february 2021 

our properties also compete with legalized gaming from casinos located on native american tribal lands while the competitive impact on operations in las vegas from the continued growth of native american gaming establishments in california remains uncertain the proliferation of gaming in california and other areas located in the same regions as our properties could have an adverse effect on our results of operations in some instances particularly in the case of native american casinos our competitors pay lower taxes or no taxes in addition certain states have legalized and others may legalize casino gaming in specific areas including metropolitan areas from which we traditionally attract customers these factors create additional challenges for us in competing for customers and accessing cash flow or financing to fund improvements for our casino and entertainment products that enable us to remain competitive 

we also compete with other nongaming resorts and vacation areas various other entertainment businesses and other forms of gaming such as state lotteries ontrack and offtrack wagering video lottery terminals and card parlors our nongaming offerings also compete with other retail facilities amusement attractions food and beverage offerings and entertainment venues internet gaming and sports betting also create additional competition for our brickandmortar operations 

resources material to business 

rewards programs 

we believe caesars rewards which we acquired in 2020 as a result of the merger enables us to compete more effectively and capture a larger share of our customers’ entertainment spending when they travel among regions versus that of a standalone property which is core to our crossmarket strategy legacy eri loyalty club members are able to link their account to caesars rewards 

members who have joined caesars rewards can earn reward credits for qualifying gaming activity and qualifying hotel dining and retail spending at all caesarsaffiliated properties in the united states canada the united kingdom and dubai members can also earn additional reward credits when they use their caesars rewards visa credit card or make a purchase through a caesars rewards partner members can redeem their earned reward credits with caesars for hotel amenities casino free play and other items such as merchandise gift cards and travel

 item 1a risk factors 

risks relating to operating our business 

the outbreak of covid19 has impacted our operations and caused an economic downturn widespread unemployment and an adverse impact on consumer sentiment and we expect that our business and results of operations will continue to be adversely affected by the impact of covid19 for the foreseeable future 

on march 13 2020 in response to the coronavirus public health emergency the us government declared a national state of emergency in an effort to help control the spread of covid19 public health officials imposed or recommended various measures all of our casino properties were temporarily closed for the period from midmarch 2020 due to orders issued by various government agencies and tribal bodies as part of certain precautionary measures intended to help slow the spread of the covid19 public health emergency see “item 1 – business  covid19 public health emergency” for further description of the precautionary measures imposed on us and the temporary closure of our casinos while we began to open our properties beginning in midmay 2020 and almost all of our properties are currently open our operations financial results and cash flows have been and we expect them to continue to be affected by social distancing measures including reduced gaming operations arising from the reconfiguration of our gaming floor limitations on the number of customers present in our facilities restrictions on hotel food and beverage outlets and limits on events that would otherwise attract customers to our properties 

covid19 has materially adversely affected the economy and financial markets of the united states and the world and has resulted in widespread unemployment in the united states consumer demand for casino hotel and racetrack properties such as ours is particularly sensitive to downturns in the economy unemployment and the associated impact on discretionary spending on leisure activities which bring demand for casino hotel properties such as ours reduced customer demand could result in lower occupancy rates reduced visitation and additional disruptions in our casino business 

the impact of covid19 on our business remains uncertain in particular a delay in wide distribution of a vaccine or a lack of public acceptance of a vaccine could lead people to continue to selfisolate and not participate in the economy at prepandemic levels for a prolonged period of time to the extent the us economy and other major global economies experience a recession as a result of covid19 our business and operations could be materially adversely affected 

the impact of changes in customer demand resulting from the economic downturn widespread unemployment reduced consumer confidence and consumer fears on our properties cannot reasonably be determined but it could be significant and protracted as a result of the foregoing we expect that covid19 will continue to have a material impact on our business financial condition liquidity results of operations including revenues and profitability for an extended period of time 

we face substantial competition in the hotel and casino industry especially in las vegas our largest jurisdiction and expect that such competition will continue 

the gaming industry is highly competitive and competition is intense in most of the markets in which we operate we compete with a variety of gaming operations including landbased casinos dockside casinos riverboat casinos casinos located on racing tracks and casinos located on native american reservations and other forms of legalized gaming such as video gaming terminals vgts at bars restaurants and truck stops and online gambling and sports betting we also compete to a lesser extent with other forms of legalized gaming and entertainment such as bingo pull tab games card parlors sportsbooks fantasy sports websites “cruisetonowhere” operations parimutuel or telephonic betting on horse racing and dog racing statesponsored lotteries jaialai and in the future may compete with gaming at other venues in addition we compete more generally with other forms of entertainment for the discretionary spending of our customers in some instances particularly in the case of native american casinos our competitors pay lower taxes or no taxes 

in recent years many casino operators including us have reinvested in existing jurisdictions to attract new customers or to gain market share thereby increasing competition in those jurisdictions as an example in response to changing trends las vegas operators have been focused on expanding their nongaming offerings including upgrades to hotel rooms new food and beverage offerings and new entertainment offerings the expansion of existing casino entertainment properties the increase in the number of properties and the aggressive marketing strategies of many of our competitors have increased competition in many markets in which we operate and this intense competition is expected to continue while the long term impact of covid19 on these market dynamics remains uncertain these competitive pressures have and are expected to continue to adversely affect our financial performance 

our brickandmortar operations face increasing competition as a result of the expansion of legalized online gaming and betting in a number of the jurisdictions in which we operate while we believe that we are well positioned to compete with new entrants to the betting and gaming market through online betting and gaming including through our online betting and gaming 

offerings the competitive dynamic is evolving and we cannot assure you that our results of operations will not be adversely impacted by the expansion of legalized online gaming and betting 

states that already have legalized casino gaming may further expand gaming and other states that have not yet legalized gaming may do so in the future we also compete with native american gaming operations in california and other jurisdictions where native american tribes operate largescale gaming facilities or otherwise conduct gaming activities on native american lands which we expect will continue to expand further expansion of legalized casino gaming in jurisdictions in or near our markets or changes to gaming laws in states in which we have operations and in states near our operations could increase competition and could adversely affect our operations 

increased competition may require us to make substantial capital expenditures to maintain and enhance the competitive positions of our properties to increase the attractiveness and add to the appeal of our facilities because a significant portion of our cash flow is required to pay obligations under our outstanding indebtedness and our lease obligations there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient funds to undertake or that we will be able to obtain sufficient financing to fund such expenditures if we are unable to make such expenditures our competitive position could be negatively affected 

our business is sensitive to reductions in discretionary consumer spending as a result of downturns in the economy and other factors outside our control 

consumer demand for casino hotel and racetrack properties such as ours is particularly sensitive to downturns in the economy and the associated impact on discretionary spending on leisure activities changes in discretionary consumer spending or consumer preferences brought about by factors such as perceived or actual general economic conditions effects of declines in consumer confidence in the economy the impact of high energy and food costs the increased cost of travel decreased disposable consumer income and wealth fears of war and future acts of terrorism or widespread illnesses or epidemics including covid19 can have a material adverse effect on leisure and business travel discretionary spending and other areas of economic behavior that directly impact the gaming and entertainment industries in general and could further reduce customer demand for the amenities that we offer in addition increases in gasoline prices including increases prompted by global political and economic instabilities can adversely affect our operations because most of our patrons travel to our properties by car or on airlines that may pass on increases in fuel costs to passengers in the form of higher ticket prices 

win rates hold rates for our casino operations depend on a variety of factors some of which are beyond our control 

the gaming industry is characterized by an element of chance accordingly we employ theoretical win rates to estimate what a certain type of game on average will win or lose in the long run in addition to the element of chance win rates hold percentages are also affected by the spread of table limits and factors that are beyond our control such as a player’s skill experience and behavior the mix of games played the financial resources of players the volume of bets placed and the amount of time players spend gambling as a result of the variability in these factors the actual win rates at our casinos may differ from the theoretical win rates we have estimated and could result in the winnings of our gaming customers exceeding those anticipated the variability of win rates hold rates also have the potential to negatively impact our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we face the risk of fraud theft and cheating 

we face the risk that gaming customers may attempt or commit fraud or theft or cheat in order to increase winnings such acts of fraud theft or cheating could involve the use of counterfeit chips or other tactics possibly in collusion with our employees internal acts of cheating could also be conducted by employees through collusion with dealers surveillance staff floor managers or other casino or gaming area staff additionally we also face the risk that customers may attempt or commit fraud or theft with respect to our nongaming offerings or against other customers such risks include stolen credit or charge cards or cash falsified checks theft of retail inventory and purchased goods and unpaid or counterfeit receipts failure to discover such acts or schemes in a timely manner could result in losses in our operations negative publicity related to such acts or schemes could have an adverse effect on our reputation potentially causing a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we extend credit to a portion of our customers and we may not be able to collect gaming receivables from our credit customers 

we conduct our gaming activities on a credit and cash basis at many of our properties any such credit we extend is unsecured table games players typically are extended more credit than slot players and highstakes players typically are extended more credit than customers who tend to wager lower amounts highend gaming is more volatile than other forms of gaming and variances in winloss results attributable to highend gaming may have a significant positive or negative impact on cash flow and earnings in a particular period we extend credit to those customers whose level of play and financial resources warrant in 

the opinion of management an extension of credit these large receivables could have a significant impact on our results of operations if deemed uncollectible gaming debts evidenced by a credit instrument including what is commonly referred to as a “marker” and judgments on gaming debts are enforceable under the current laws of the jurisdictions in which we allow play on a credit basis and judgments on gaming debts in such jurisdictions are enforceable in all us states under the full faith and credit clause of the us constitution however other jurisdictions may determine that enforcement of gaming debts is against public policy although courts of some foreign nations will enforce gaming debts directly and the assets in the us of foreign debtors may be reached to satisfy a judgment judgments on gaming debts from us courts are not binding on the courts of many foreign nations 

in addition in november 2017 the chinese government adopted new rules to control the crossborder transportation of cash and bearer negotiable instruments specifically to reduce the international transfer of cash in connection with activities that are illegal in china including gambling the chinese government has recently taken steps to prohibit the transfer of cash for the payment of gaming debts these developments may have the effect of reducing the collectability of gaming debts of players from china it is unclear whether these and other measures will continue to be in effect or become more restrictive in the future these and any future foreign currency control policy developments that may be implemented by foreign jurisdictions could significantly impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

compromises of our information systems or unauthorized access to confidential information or our customers’ personal information could materially harm our reputation and business 

we collect and store confidential personal information relating to our customers for various business purposes including marketing and financial purposes and credit card information for processing payments for example we handle collect and store personal information in connection with our customers staying at our hotels and enrolling in caesars rewards we may share this personal and confidential information with vendors or other third parties in connection with processing of transactions operating certain aspects of our business or for marketing purposes our collection and use of personal data are governed by state and federal privacy laws and regulations as well as the applicable laws and regulations in other countries in which we operate privacy law is subject to frequent changes and varies significantly by jurisdiction we may incur significant costs in order to ensure compliance with the various applicable privacy requirements in addition privacy laws and regulations may limit our ability to market to our customers 

we assess and monitor the security of collection storage and transmission of customer information on an ongoing basis we utilize commercially available software and technologies to monitor assess and secure our network further some of the systems currently used for transmission and approval of payment card transactions and the technology utilized in payment cards themselves all of which can put payment card data at risk are determined and controlled by the payment card industry and other such systems are determined and controlled by us although we have taken steps designed to safeguard our customers’ confidential personal information and important internal company data our network and other systems and those of third parties such as service providers could be compromised damaged or disrupted by a thirdparty breach of our system security or that of a thirdparty provider or as a result of purposeful or accidental actions of third parties our employees or those employees of a third party power outages computer viruses system failures natural disasters or other catastrophic events our thirdparty information system service providers face risks relating to cybersecurity similar to ours and we do not directly control any of such parties’ information security operations advances in computer and software capabilities encryption technology new tools and other developments may increase the risk of a security breach as a result of any security breach customer information or other proprietary data may be accessed or transmitted by or to a third party despite the measures we have implemented to safeguard our information there can be no assurance that we are adequately protecting our information 

any loss disclosure of misappropriation of or access to customers’ or other proprietary information or other breach of our information security could result in legal claims or legal proceedings including regulatory investigations and actions or liability for failure to comply with privacy and information security laws including for failure to protect personal information or for misusing personal information which could disrupt our operations damage our reputation and expose us to claims from customers financial institutions regulators payment card associations employees and other persons any of which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

we have cybersecurity insurance to respond to a breach which is designed to cover expenses around notification credit monitoring investigation crisis management public relations and legal advice we also carry other insurance which may cover ancillary aspects of the event however damage and claims arising from a breach may not be completely covered or may exceed the amount of any insurance available 

our reliance on our computer systems and software could expose us to great financial harm if any of our computer systems or software were subject to any material disruption or corruption 

we rely significantly on our computer systems and software to receive and properly process internal and external data including data related to caesars rewards a disruption or corruption of the proper functioning of our computer systems or software could cause us to lose data or record erroneous data which could result in material losses we cannot guarantee that our efforts to maintain competitive computer systems and software will be successful our computer systems and software may fail or be subject to bugs or other errors resulting in service interruptions or other unintended consequences if any of these risks materialize they could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

acts of terrorism war natural disasters severe weather and political economic and military conditions may impede our ability to operate or may negatively impact our financial results 

terrorist attacks and other acts of war or hostility have created many economic and political uncertainties for example a substantial number of the customers of our properties in las vegas use air travel as a result of terrorist acts that occurred on september 11 2001 domestic and international travel was severely disrupted which resulted in a decrease in customer visits to our properties in las vegas visitation to las vegas also declined for a period of time following the mass shooting tragedy on october 1 2017 we cannot predict the extent to which disruptions in air or other forms of travel as a result of any further terrorist act security alerts or war uprisings or hostilities in places such as iraq afghanistan andor syria or other countries throughout the world and governmental responses to those acts or hostilities will directly or indirectly impact our business and operating results for example our operations in cairo egypt were negatively affected from the uprising there in january 2011 as a consequence of the threat of terrorist attacks and other acts of war or hostility in the future premiums for a variety of insurance products have increased and some types of insurance are no longer available if any such event were to affect our properties we would likely be adversely affected 

in addition natural and manmade disasters such as major fires floods severe snowstorms hurricanes earthquakes and oil spills could also adversely impact our business and operating results such events could lead to the loss of use of one or more of our properties for an extended period of time and disrupt our ability to attract customers to certain of our gaming facilities for example our property in lake charles louisiana has been closed since august 27 2020 due to damage resulting from hurricane laura inadequate insurance or lack of available insurance for these and other certain types or levels of risk could expose us to significant losses in the event that a catastrophe occurred for which we are underinsured in most cases we have insurance that covers portions of any losses from a natural disaster but it is subject to deductibles and maximum payouts in many cases although we may be covered by insurance from a natural disaster the timing of our receipt of insurance proceeds if any may be out of our control in some cases however we may receive no proceeds from insurance further if properties subject to our leases with vici and glpi are impacted by a casualty event such leases require us to repair or restore the affected properties even if the cost of such repair or restoration exceeds the insurance proceeds that we receive under such circumstances the rent under such leases is required to be paid during the period of repair or restoration even if all or a portion of the affected property is not operating in addition to the damage caused to our properties by a casualty loss we may suffer business disruption as a result of the casualty event or be subject to claims by third parties that may be injured or harmed while we carry general liability insurance and business interruption insurance there can be no assurance that insurance will be available or adequate to cover all loss and damage to which our business or our assets might be subjected and the timing and receipt of insurance proceeds if any may be out of our control 

our business may be subject to seasonal fluctuations that could result in volatility and have an adverse effect on our operating results 

our business may be subject to some degree of seasonality weather conditions may deter or prevent customers from reaching the facilities or undertaking trips such conditions would particularly affect customers who are traveling longer distances to visit our properties seasonality may cause our properties working capital cash flow requirements to vary from quarter to quarter depending on the variability in the volume and timing of sales business in our properties can also fluctuate due to specific holidays or other significant events such as easter particularly when the holiday falls in a different quarter than the prior year the world series of poker tournament with respect to our las vegas properties citywide conventions a large sporting event or a concert or visits by our premium players we also believe that any seasonality holiday or other significant event may affect our various properties or regions differently these factors among other things make forecasting more difficult and may adversely affect our properties’ ability to manage working capital and to predict financial results accurately which could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

our business is particularly sensitive to energy prices and a rise in energy prices could harm our operating results 

we are a large consumer of electricity and other energy and therefore higher energy prices may have an adverse effect on our results of operations accordingly increases in energy costs may have a negative impact on our operating results additionally 

higher electricity and gasoline prices that affect our customers may result in reduced visitation to our resorts and a reduction in our revenues we may be indirectly impacted by regulatory requirements aimed at reducing the impacts of climate change directed at upstream utility providers as we could experience potentially higher utility fuel and transportation costs 

any deterioration in our reputation or the reputation of our brands could adversely impact our business financial condition or results of operations 

our business is dependent on the quality and reputation of our company and brands events beyond our control could affect the reputation of one or more of our properties or more generally impact our corporate or brand image other factors that could influence our reputation include the quality of the services we offer and our actions with regard to social issues such as diversity human rights and support for local communities broad access to social media makes it easy for anyone to provide public feedback that can influence perceptions of us our brands or our properties it may be difficult to control or effectively manage negative publicity regardless of whether it is accurate negative events and publicity could quickly and materially damage perceptions of us our brands or our properties which in turn could adversely impact our business financial condition or results of operations through loss of customers loss of business opportunities lack of acceptance of our company to operate in host communities employee retention or recruiting difficulties or other difficulties 

risks related to human capital 

we rely on our key personnel and we may face difficulties in attracting and retaining qualified employees for our casinos and race tracks 

our future success will depend upon among other things our ability to keep our senior executives and highly qualified employees the operation of our business requires qualified executives managers and skilled employees with gaming and horse racing industry experience and qualifications who are able to obtain the requisite licenses and approval from the applicable gaming authorities we compete with other potential employers for employees and we may not succeed in hiring or retaining the executives and other employees that we need a sudden loss of or inability to replace key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations moreover there has from time to time been a shortage of skilled labor in our markets and the continued expansion of gaming near our facilities including the expansion of native american gaming and internet betting and gaming may make it more difficult for us to attract qualified candidates while we believe that we will continue to be able to attract and retain qualified employees shortages of skilled labor will make it increasingly difficult and expensive to attract and retain the services of a satisfactory number of qualified employees and we may incur higher costs than expected as a result 

work stoppages and other labor problems could negatively impact our future profits 

as of december 31 2020 we had collective bargaining agreements covering approximately 21000 employees a lengthy strike or other work stoppages at any of our casino properties could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

from time to time we have also experienced attempts by labor organizations to organize certain of our nonunion employees these efforts have achieved some success to date we cannot provide any assurance that we will not experience additional and successful union activity in the future the impact of this union activity is undetermined and could negatively impact our results of operations 

we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our performers and other entertainment offerings on acceptable terms or at all 

while our ability to offer live performances has been limited due to covid19 historically our performers have drawn customers to our properties and have been a significant source of our revenue we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our performers or other shows on acceptable terms or at all in addition the third parties that we depend on for our properties’ entertainment offerings may become incapable or unwilling to provide their services at the level agreed upon or at all 

risks relating to our capital structure 

our substantial indebtedness and the fact that a significant portion of our cash flow is used to make interest payments and rent payments under our lease agreements could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry and prevent us from making debt service payments and rent payments 

as of december 31 2020 we had 150 billion of outstanding face value indebtedness in addition to leases with vici and glpi that require an annual rent payment of 11 billion in 2021 and that are subject to annual escalation see note 10 for a description of our obligations under our leases with vici and glpi and note 12 for details regarding our debt outstanding and related restrictive covenants as a result a significant portion of our cash flow is applied to make interest payments with respect to our outstanding debt and payments under our leases these financial obligations may have important negative consequences for us including 

• limiting our ability to use operating cash flow in other areas of our business because we must dedicate a significant portion of these funds to make payments on our debt and lease obligations 

• increasing our vulnerability to the covid19 pandemic and general adverse economic and industry conditions 

• limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our businesses and the markets in which we operate 

• placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors with debt and rent obligations that are less than ours 

• increasing our vulnerability to and limiting our ability to react to changing market conditions changes in our industry and economic downturns 

• limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund working capital requirements capital expenditures debt service acquisitions general corporate or other obligations 

• subjecting us to a number of restrictive covenants that among other things require us to make capital expenditures and limit our ability to pay dividends and distributions make acquisitions and dispositions borrow additional funds and make other investments 

• exposing us to interest rate risk due to the variable interest rate on borrowings under our credit facilities and 

• affecting our ability to renew gaming and other licenses necessary to conduct our business 

despite our current indebtedness levels we and our subsidiaries may still incur significant additional indebtedness incurring more indebtedness could increase the risks associated with our substantial indebtedness 

we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness including additional secured indebtedness and may enter into financing obligations similar to our leases with vici and glpi in the future as of december 31 2020 we had 22 billion of borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facilities before consideration of 19 million in outstanding letters of credit under cei revolving credit facility and 65 million in outstanding letters of credit under crc revolving credit facility further our existing debt agreements currently permit and we expect that agreements governing debt that we incur in the future will permit us to incur certain other additional secured and unsecured debt further we may incur other liabilities that do not constitute indebtedness the risks that we face based on our outstanding indebtedness may intensify if we incur additional indebtedness or financing obligations in the future 

the libor calculation method may change and libor is expected to be phased out after 2021 

our credit facilities calculate interest on the outstanding principal balance using libor on july 27 2017 the united kingdom financial conduct authority the “fca” announced it would phase out libor as a benchmark by the end of 2021 in the meantime actions by the fca other regulators or law enforcement agencies may result in changes to the method by which libor is calculated at this time it is not possible to predict the effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows of any such changes or any other reforms to libor that may be enacted in the united kingdom or elsewhere 

a significant portion of our casinos are located on leased property if we default on one or more leases the applicable lessors could terminate the affected leases and we could lose possession of the affected casino 

we currently lease certain parcels of land on which a significant portion of our properties are located as a ground lessee we have the right to use the leased land however we do not hold fee ownership of the underlying land accordingly we have no interest in the leased land or improvements thereon at the expiration of the ground leases if our use of the land underlying our casino properties is disrupted permanently or for a significant period of time then the value of our assets could be impaired and our business and operations could be adversely affected our leases provide that they may be terminated for a number of reasons including failure to pay rent taxes or other payment obligations or the breach of other covenants contained in the leases in particular our leases with glpi and vici require annual rent payments of at least 11 billion in 2021 which is subject to escalation annually and obligate us to make specified minimum capital expenditures with respect to the leased properties if our business and properties fail to generate sufficient earnings the payments required to service the rent obligations under our leases with glpi and vici could materially and adversely limit our ability to react to changes in our business and make acquisitions and investments in our properties if we were to default on any one or more of these leases the applicable lessors could terminate the affected leases and we could lose possession of the affected land and any improvements on the land including the hotels and casinos a termination of our ground leases or our leases with glpi or vici could result in a default under our debt agreements and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results 

of operations further in the event that any lessor of our leased properties including glpi or vici encounters financial operational regulatory or other challenges there can be no assurance that such lessor will be able to comply with its obligations under the applicable lease 

certain of our leases including our leases with glpi and vici are “triplenet” leases accordingly in addition to rent we are required to pay among other things the following 1 lease payments to the underlying ground lessor for properties that are subject to ground leases 2 facility maintenance costs 3 all insurance premiums for insurance with respect to the leased properties and the business conducted on the leased properties 4 taxes levied on or with respect to the leased properties other than taxes on the income of the lessor and 5 all utilities and other services necessary or appropriate for the leased properties and the business conducted on the leased properties we are responsible for incurring the costs described in the preceding sentence notwithstanding the fact that many of the benefits received in exchange for such costs shall in part accrue to the lessor as the owner of the associated facilities in addition we remain obligated for lease payments and other obligations under our leases with glpi and vici and other ground leases even if one or more of such leased facilities is unprofitable or if we decide to withdraw from those locations we could incur special charges relating to the closing of such facilities including lease termination costs impairment charges and other special charges that would reduce our net income and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

legal and regulatory risks 

we are subject to extensive governmental regulation taxation policies and licensing and gaming authorities have significant control over our operations which could have an adverse effect on our business 

licensing requirements  the ownership and operation of casino gaming online betting and gaming riverboat and horse racing facilities are subject to extensive federal state and local regulation and regulatory authorities at local state and national levels have broad powers with respect to the licensing of gaming businesses we currently hold all state and local licenses and related approvals necessary to conduct our present gaming operations but we must periodically apply to renew many of our licenses and registrations we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such renewals any failure to maintain or renew our existing licenses registrations permits or approvals would have a material adverse effect on us furthermore if additional laws or regulations are adopted or existing laws or regulations are amended or interpreted differently these regulations could impose additional restrictions or costs that could have a significant adverse effect on us 

gaming authorities with jurisdiction over our operations may in their discretion require the holder of any securities issued by us to file applications be investigated and be found suitable to own our securities and if a holder is found unsuitable we can be sanctioned including the loss of approvals that are required for us to continue our gaming operations in the relevant jurisdictions if such unsuitable person does not timely sell our securities our officers directors and key employees are also subject to similar findings of unsuitability and the gaming authorities may require us to terminate the employment of any person who refuses to file appropriate applications see “item 1  gaming licenses and governmental regulations” and exhibit 991 for further description of the regulations to which we are subject the results of findings of unsuitability could materially adversely affect our gaming operations applicable gaming laws and regulations restrict our ability to issue securities incur debt and undertake other financing activities such transactions would generally require approval of applicable gaming authorities and our financing counterparties including lenders might be subject to various licensing and related approval procedures in the various jurisdictions in which we operate gaming facilities 

compliance with other laws  we are also subject to a variety of other federal state and local laws rules regulations and ordinances that apply to nongaming businesses including restrictions enacted in response to covd19 zoning environmental construction and landuse laws and regulations governing smoking and the serving of alcoholic beverages our operations have been adversely impacted by regulations enacted to limit the spread of covid19 in addition legislation in various forms to ban indoor tobacco smoking has been enacted or introduced in many states and local jurisdictions including several of the jurisdictions in which we operate if additional restrictions are enacted in our jurisdictions we could experience a significant decrease in gaming revenue and operating results at our properties and particularly if such restrictions are not applicable to all competitive facilities in that gaming market our business could be materially adversely affected the likelihood or outcome of similar legislation in other jurisdictions and referendums in the future cannot be predicted though any additional limitations on our operations would be expected to negatively impact our financial performance 

regulations adopted by fincen require us to report currency transactions in excess of 10000 occurring within a gaming day us treasury department regulations also require us to report certain suspicious activity including any transaction that exceeds 5000 if we know suspect or have reason to believe that the transaction involves funds from illegal activity or is designed to evade federal regulations or reporting requirements substantial penalties can be imposed if we fail to comply with these regulations fincen has recently increased its focus on gaming companies 

we are required to report certain customer’s gambling winnings via form w2g to comply with current internal revenue service regulations should these regulations change we would expect to incur additional costs to comply with the revised reporting requirements 

taxation and fees  in addition gaming companies are generally subject to significant revenuebased taxes and fees in addition to normal federal state and local income taxes and such taxes and fees are subject to increase at any time we pay substantial taxes and fees with respect to our operations tax laws are dynamic and subject to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of the law are issued or applied affecting the gaming industry the large number of state and local governments with significant current or projected budget deficits makes it more likely that those governments that currently permit gaming will seek to fund such deficits with new or increased gaming taxes andor property taxes and worsening economic conditions could intensify those efforts any material increase or the adoption of additional taxes or fees could have a material adverse effect on our future financial results 

we expect to expand our sportsbook business and engage in online sportsbook casino gaming and poker there can be no assurance that regulations authorizing such activities will be approved in the jurisdictions in which we operate or that the market for such gaming activities will develop as expected 

during the second quarter of 2018 the us supreme court overturned the federal ban on sports betting as a result several jurisdictions in which we operate legalized sports betting and additional jurisdictions may do so in the future we have entered into an agreement with william hill plc on the terms of a recommended cash acquisition pursuant to which we would acquire the entire issued and to be issued share capital other than shares owned by us or held in treasury of william hill plc and we currently have relationships with i william hill pursuant to which william hill has agreed to operate as our sports betting operator including with respect to mobile and online sports wagering for a period of 25 years ii the stars group inc “tsg” pursuant to which we agreed to provide tsg with options to obtain access to certain of our licenses for online sports wagering and real money online gaming and poker for a period of 20 years iii various sports brands including nfl and espn for limited events and iv other online betting and gaming operators see “item 7 – management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – partnerships and acquisitions” for a further description of the arrangements with william hill tsg and additional sports brands currently william hill operates 37 sportsbooks at our properties in eight states and following the acquisition caesars and william hill will be live with sports wagering across 15 us states plus the district of columbia however our ability to further expand our sports betting and online operations is dependent on adoption of regulations permitting sports betting in the united there can be no assurances when or if any such regulations will be adopted or the terms of such regulations in certain of the jurisdictions in which we operate 

the market for sports betting and online gaming is rapidly evolving and highly competitive with an increasing number of competitors the success of our sportsbook and online betting and gaming partners our interest in william hill and tsg and the results of operations from sports betting and online sportsbook and gaming conducted at our properties or under the authority of our licenses are dependent on a number of factors that are beyond our control including 

• the timing of adoption of regulations authorizing such betting and gaming activities and the restrictions contained in such regulations 

• the tax rates and license fees applicable to such activities; 

• our ability to gain market share in a newly developing market; 

• the potential that the market does not develop at all or does not develop as we anticipate 

• our ability to compete with new entrants in the market; 

• changes in consumer demographics and public tastes and preferences; and 

• the availability and popularity of other forms of entertainment 

there can be no assurance as to the returns that we will receive from our current and anticipated sports betting and online gaming operations or our other relationships that we have granted rights to market access or future similar arrangements with other market service providers 

we may not be able to protect the intellectual property rights we own or may be prevented from using intellectual property necessary for our business 

the development of intellectual property is part of our overall business strategy and we regard our intellectual property to be an important element of our success we rely primarily on trade secret trademark domain name copyright and contract law to protect the intellectual property and proprietary technology we own we also actively pursue business opportunities in the united states and in international jurisdictions involving the licensing of our trademarks to third parties it is possible that third parties may copy or otherwise obtain and use our intellectual property or proprietary technology without authorization or otherwise infringe on our rights for example while we have a policy of entering into confidentiality intellectual property invention assignment andor noncompetition and nonsolicitation agreements or restrictions with our employees independent 

contractors and business partners such agreements may not provide adequate protection or may be breached or our proprietary technology may otherwise become available to or be independently developed by our competitors the laws of some foreign countries may not protect proprietary rights or intellectual property to as great an extent as do the laws of the united states despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights the unauthorized use or reproduction of our trademarks could diminish the value of our trademarks and our market acceptance competitive advantages or goodwill which could adversely affect our business 

third parties have alleged and may in the future allege that we are infringing misappropriating or otherwise violating their intellectual property rights third parties may initiate litigation against us without warning or may send us letters or other communications that make allegations without initiating litigation we may elect not to respond to these letters or other communications if we believe they are without merit or we may attempt to resolve these disputes out of court by negotiating a license but in either case it is possible that such disputes will ultimately result in litigation any such claims could interfere with our ability to use technology or intellectual property that is material to the operation of our business such claims may be made by competitors seeking to obtain a competitive advantage or by other parties such as entities that purchase intellectual property assets for the purpose of bringing infringement claims we also periodically employ individuals who were previously employed by our competitors or potential competitors and we may therefore be subject to claims that such employees have used or disclosed the alleged trade secrets or other proprietary information of their former employers 

at any time we may have to rely on litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights protect our trade secrets determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or defend against claims of infringement or invalidity any such litigation whether successful or unsuccessful could result in substantial costs and the diversion of resources and the attention of management if unsuccessful such litigation could result in the loss of important intellectual property rights require us to pay substantial damages subject us to injunctions that prevent us from using certain intellectual property require us to make admissions that affect our reputation in the marketplace and require us to enter into license agreements that may not be available on favorable terms or at all finally even if we prevail in any litigation the remedy may not be commercially meaningful or fully compensate us for the harm we suffer or the costs we incur any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are or may become involved in legal proceedings that if adversely adjudicated or settled could impact our business and financial condition 

from time to time we are named in lawsuits or other legal proceedings relating to our respective businesses some of these matters involve commercial or contractual disputes intellectual property claims legal compliance personal injury claims and employment claims as with all legal proceedings no assurances can be given as to the outcome of these matters moreover legal proceedings can be expensive and time consuming and we may not be successful in defending or prosecuting these lawsuits which could result in settlements or damages that could significantly impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

risks relating to the completion of the merger and the wh acquisition and the integration of the company and former caesars and william hill 

we may fail to consummate the wh acquisition or may not consummate it on the terms described herein 

on september 30 2020 we announced that we had reached an agreement with william hill plc on the terms of a recommended cash acquisition pursuant to which we would acquire the entire issued and to be issued share capital other than shares owned by us or held in treasury of william hill plc in an allcash transaction of approximately £29 billion or 37 billion the “wh acquisition” while we received the approval of william hill plc shareholders and obtained the early termination of the waiting period under the hartscottrodino antitrust improvements act of 1976 “hsr act” the wh acquisition remains subject to gaming regulatory approvals  see “ the wh acquisition is subject to the receipt of governmental approvals that may impose conditions that could have an adverse effect on us or if not obtained could prevent consummation of the wh acquisition ” as a result the possible timing and likelihood of the completion of the wh acquisition are uncertain and accordingly there can be no assurance that such acquisition will be completed on the expected terms anticipated schedule or at all 

in the event that we fail to consummate the wh acquisition we will have issued a significant number of additional shares of common stock and we will not have acquired the revenue generating assets that will be required to produce the earnings and cash flow we anticipated as a result failure to consummate the wh acquisition would adversely affect our earnings per share and our ability to make distributions to stockholders if the wh acquisition is not consummated we could be subject to a number of risks that may adversely affect our business and the market price of our common stock including 

• we will be required to pay costs relating to the wh acquisition such as legal accounting financial advisory and printing fees whether or not the wh acquisition is consummated 

• time and resources committed by our management to matters relating to the wh acquisition could otherwise have been devoted to pursuing other beneficial opportunities 

• the market price of our common stock could decline to the extent that the current market price reflects a market assumption that the wh acquisition will be consummated and 

• we would not realize the benefits we expect to realize from consummating the wh acquisition 

any increased costs associated with the delay or abandonment of the wh acquisition in addition to the impact of covid19 may adversely impact our ability to remain in compliance with our covenants contained in the agreements governing our indebtedness and lease obligations and our liquidity moreover if the wh acquisition is not consummated our reputation in our industry and in the investment community could be damaged and the market price of our common stock could decline 

the wh acquisition is subject to the receipt of governmental approvals that may impose conditions that could have an adverse effect on us or if not obtained could prevent consummation of the wh acquisition 

consummation of the wh acquisition remains subject to gaming regulatory approvals  including without limitation including among others the gaming board for the bahamas indiana gaming commission nevada gaming control board and gaming commission and new jersey division of gaming enforcement additionally the combination requires the english high courts final approval and administrative and postclosing approvals from other us and international agencies there can be no assurance that these approvals will be obtained and that the other conditions to consummating the wh acquisition will be satisfied 

in addition the governmental authorities from which the regulatory approvals are required may impose conditions on the consummation of the wh acquisition or require changes to the terms of the wh acquisition or agreements to be entered into in connection with the wh acquisition such conditions or changes and the process of obtaining regulatory approvals could have the effect of delaying or impeding consummation of the wh acquisition or of imposing additional costs or limitations on us following consummation of the wh acquisition any of which might have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the integration of the company and former caesars and william hill may present significant challenges we cannot be sure that we will be able to realize the anticipated benefits of the merger and the wh acquisition in the anticipated time frame or at all 

our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the merger and the wh acquisition will significantly depends on our ability to integrate the businesses of former caesars and william hill into the company in the anticipated time frame or at all the combination of independent businesses is a complex costly and timeconsuming process as a result we are required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating the business practices and operations of former caesars into those of the company and we expect that our acquisition of william hill will present similar challenges the integration process may disrupt the businesses and if implemented ineffectively or inefficiently would preclude realization of the full benefits expected by us the failure to successfully integrate former caesars and william hill into the company and to manage the challenges presented by the integration process successfully may result in an interruption of or loss of momentum in the business of the company which may have the effect of depressing the market price of our common stock

net revenues 

net revenues were as follows 



consolidated revenues increased for the year ended december 31 2020 as a result of our acquisition of former caesars on july 20 2020 this was offset by a decline in revenues associated with the impact of covid19 public health emergency and to a lesser extent divestitures of certain properties discussed earlier all of our casino properties were temporarily closed for the period from midmarch 2020 through midmay 2020 due to orders issued by various government agencies and tribal bodies as part of certain precautionary measures intended to help slow the spread of the covid19 public health emergency on may 15 2020 we began reopening our properties and have resumed certain operations at all of our properties as of december 31 2020 with the exception of additional temporary closures of caesars windsor harrah’s philadelphia and our properties in illinois subsequently harrah’s philadelphia and our properties in illinois have reopened our property in lake charles remains closed as a result of damage suffered in hurricane laura and will remain closed until construction of a new landbased casino is complete due to the impact of the covid19 public health emergency including local and state regulations and the implementation of social distancing and health and safety protocols our properties are subject to reduced gaming capacity and hotel occupancy limited operation of food and beverage outlets live entertainment events and conventions as a result gaming revenue represents a larger portion of our total revenues following the reopening of our properties as compared to earlier periods which we expect to continue until such time as we are able to fully operate our nongaming amenities following the reduction or elimination of social distancing and safety and health protocols and other regulatory restrictions limiting capacity and other aspects of our business 

our diversified portfolio has yielded mixed results as the properties have reopened under the conditions noted above net revenues for properties which have historically relied on a local customer base not dependent on air travel or convention business showed a smaller decrease as compared to the year ended december 31 2019 results these properties’ gaming and hotel revenues have historically been the largest portion of their total revenue properties in destination markets such as las vegas atlantic city northern nevada and new orleans which have historically relied on a broader regional and national customer base or convention business have declined significantly as compared to the prior year period these destination markets were impacted by restrictions on and an overall decline in air travel related to covid19 these properties have historically relied on a broader mix of revenue sources including convention entertainment and food and beverage offerings as a result of reduced visitation air travel state and local restrictions on capacity and social distancing and safety and health protocols these sources of revenue have been materially reduced as compared to prior periods

casino and parimutuel hotel food and beverage and other expenses for the year ended december 31 2020 increased year over year as a result of our acquisition of former caesars this was partially offset as a result of the temporary closures of all of our properties due to the covid19 public health emergency which reduced our salaries and wages gaming taxes costs of goods sold and other expenses as discussed above our reopened properties are operating with reduced gaming and hotel capacity and limited food and beverage options in addition our properties have reduced marketing and promotional spend resulting in further declines in gaming expenses

for the year ended december 31 2020 compared to the same prior year period corporate expenses increased primarily due to the acquisition of former caesars offset by reductions in salaries and wages due to reductions in workforce implemented as a result of the impact of the covid19 public health emergency 

for the year ended december 31 2020 compared to the same prior year period depreciation and amortization expense increased mainly due to the acquisition of former caesars offset by ceasing depreciation and amortization expense on assets held for sale and the divestitures 

for the year ended december 31 2020 compared to the same prior year period transaction costs and other operating costs increased primarily due to costs or fees incurred related to the merger various project exit fees and related write offs and higher severance expense related to synergies associated with the merger 

impairment charges increased by 214 million in 2020 due to impairment related to goodwill and trade names recognized due to a triggering event resulting from the covid19 public health emergency as well as impairments related to our held for sale properties recognized due to the carrying value exceeding the estimated net sales proceeds 

other expense 

other expense was as follows 



 

 not meaningful 

for the year ended december 31 2020 interest expense net increased year over year as a result of our acquisition of former caesars outstanding debt assumed additional debt raised and assumed financing obligations resulted in the increase in interest expense

for the year ended december 31 2020 other loss income increased year over year mainly due to a gain of 169 million related to the change in the foreign currency exchange rate associated with restricted cash held in gbp for and a derivative contract related to our expected acquisition of william hill 

the effective tax rate was 77 for 2020 352 for 2019 and 298 for 2018 the effective tax rate in 2020 differed from the statutory rate of 21 primarily due to an increase in the valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets due to the series of transactions with vici during the year

crc notes 

on october 16 2017 crc issued 17 billion aggregate principal amount of 525 senior notes due 2025 the “crc notes” 

former caesars 5 convertible notes 

on october 6 2017 former caesars issued 11 billion aggregate principal amount of 500 convertible senior notes maturing in 2024 the “5 convertible notes” 

the 5 convertible notes are convertible into weighted average of the number of shares of company common stock and amount of cash actually received per share by holders of common stock of former caesars that made elections for consideration in the merger as of december 31 2020 we have paid approximately 903 million and issued approximately 108 million shares upon conversion of 770 million of the 5 convertible notes during 2020 

the company has determined that the 5 convertible notes contain derivative features that require bifurcation the company separately accounts for the liability component and equity conversion option of the 5 convertible notes the portion of the overall fair value allocated to the liability was calculated by using a marketbased approach without the conversion features included the difference between the overall instrument value and the value of the liability component was assumed to be the value of the equity conversion option component the value of the liability is determined based on a discounted cash flow of the debt instrument see note 8 for more information on the 5 convertible notes’ fair value measurements 

net amortization of the debt issuance costs and the discount andor premium associated with the company’s indebtedness totaled 80 million 8 million and 6 million for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively amortization of debt issuance costs is computed using the effective interest method and is included in interest expense 

vici leases 

upon consummation of the merger we assumed obligations of certain real property assets leased from vici by former caesars under the following agreements i for a portfolio of properties at various locations throughout the united states the “noncplv lease” ii for caesars palace las vegas the “cplv lease” iii for harrah’s joliet hotel  casino the “joliet lease” and iv for harrah’s las vegas the “hlv lease” these lease agreements provided for annual fixed rent subject to escalation of 773 million during an initial period then rent consisting of both base rent and variable rent elements the lease agreements had a 15year initial term and four fiveyear renewal options the lease agreements included escalation provisions beginning in year two of the initial term and continuing through the renewal terms the lease agreements also included provisions for variable rent payments calculated in part based on increases or decreases of net revenue of the underlying lease properties commencing in year eight of the initial term and continuing through the renewal terms 

former caesars entered into a golf course use agreement with vici which has a 35year term inclusive of all renewal periods pursuant to which such affiliates of the company agreed to pay i an annual payment of 10 million subject to escalation ii an annual use fee of 3 million subject to escalation beginning in the second year and iii certain perround fees all as more particularly set forth in the golf course use agreement 

in connection with the closing of the merger on july 20 2020 we consummated a series of transactions with vici and certain of its affiliates in accordance with the mta entered on june 24 2019 and certain purchase and sales agreement entered on 

september 26 2019 we consummated sale leaseback transactions related to harrah’s new orleans harrah’s laughlin and harrah’s resort atlantic city including the harrah’s atlantic city waterfront conference center for approximately 18 billion of net proceeds the cplv lease with vici was amended among other things i add harrah’s las vegas “hlv” to the leased premises thereunder and in connection therewith hlv lease was terminated ii add subject to certain adjustments the rent payable with respect to hlv under such terminated standalone lease to such lease and further increase the annual rent payable with respect to hlv by approximately 15 million iii increase the annual rent with respect to cplv by approximately 84 million and iv extend the term of such lease so that following the amendment of such lease there will be 15 years remaining until the expiration of the initial term in addition harrah’s new orleans harrah’s laughlin and harrah’s resort atlantic city including the harrah’s atlantic city waterfront conference center were added to the noncplv lease as amended the “regional lease” and such lease was further amended to increase the annual rent thereunder by 154 million in the aggregate related to such added properties and extend the term of such lease so that following the amendment of such lease there will be 15 years remaining until the expiration of the initial term furthermore the joliet lease as well as the term of the golf course use agreement were extended such that there will be 15 years remaining until the expiration of the initial term 

on december 24 2020 the company entered into agreement to sell caesars southern indiana to the eastern band of cherokee indians “ebci” for 250 million subject to a customary working capital adjustment caesar’s annual payments to vici properties under the regional lease will decline by 33 million upon closing of the transaction 

our vici lease is accounted for as a financing obligation and totaled 110 billion as of december 31 2020 furthermore we obtained waivers from vici with relation to annual capital expenditure requirements for 2020 see note 10 to our consolidated condensed financial statements for additional information about our vici lease and related matters 

glpi leases 

our glpi master lease is accounted for as a financing obligation and totaled 12 billion as of december 31 2020 additionally our glpi master lease contains certain operating capital expenditure and financial covenants thereunder and our ability to maintain compliance with these covenants was also negatively impacted on june 15 2020 we entered into an amendment to the glpi master lease which among other things provides certain relief under these covenants in the event of facility closures due to pandemics governmental restrictions and certain other instances of unavoidable delay as of july 17 2020 the amendment to the glpi master lease became effective as we obtained all necessary approvals and the applicable waiting period expired see note 10 to our consolidated condensed financial statements for additional information about our glpi master lease and related matters 

other liquidity matters

critical accounting policies and estimates 

we prepare our financial statements in conformity with gaap in preparing our financial statements we have made our best estimates and judgments of the amounts and disclosures included in the financial statements giving regard to materiality when more than one accounting principle or method of its application is generally accepted we select the principle or method that we consider to be the most appropriate under specific circumstances application of these accounting principles requires us to make estimates about the future resolution of existing uncertainties certain of our accounting policies including those in connection with business combinations certain fair value measurements income taxes longlived assets goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets allowance for doubtful accounts related to certain gaming receivables selfinsurance reserves and litigation claims and assessments require that we apply significant judgment in defining the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 

we consider accounting estimates to be critical accounting policies when 

• the estimates involve matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made and 

• different estimates or changes to estimates could have a material impact on the reported financial position changes in financial position or results of operations 

by their nature these judgments and estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty our judgments and estimates are based on our historical experience terms of existing contracts observance of trends in the industry information gathered from customer behavior and information available from other outside sources as appropriate due to the inherent uncertainty involving judgments and estimates actual results may differ from those estimates 

our most critical accounting estimates and assumptions are in the following areas 

business combinations 

we applied the provisions of accounting standards codification “asc” topic 805 “business combinations” in the accounting for our acquisitions of former caesars tropicana elgin and our previous acquisitions it required us to recognize the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair values which were determined using market income and cost approaches or a combination goodwill as of the respective acquisition dates was measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed goodwill is generally the result of expected synergies of the combined company or an assembled workforce 

indefinitelived intangible assets acquired primarily include trademarks caesars rewards acquired in the merger customer relationships and gaming rights the fair value for these intangible assets was determined using either the relief from royalty method and excess earnings method under the income approach or a replacement cost market approach 

trademarks and caesars rewards were valued using the relief from royalty method which presumes that without ownership of such trademarks or loyalty program we would have to make a stream of payments to a brand or franchise owner in return for the right to use their name or program by virtue of this asset we avoid any such payments and record the related intangible value of the company’s ownership of the brand name or program 

customer relationships were valued using the cost approach and the incremental cash flow method under the income approach the incremental cash flow method compares the prospective cash flows with and without the customer relationships in place to estimate the fair value of the customer relationships with the fair value assumed to be equal to the discounted cash flows of the business that would be lost if the customer relationships were not in place and needed to be replaced 

gaming rights include our gaming licenses in various jurisdictions and may have indefinite lives or an estimated useful life the fair value of the gaming rights was determined using the excess earnings or replacement cost methodology based on whether the license resides in gaming jurisdictions where competition is limited to a specified number of licensed gaming operators the excess earnings methodology is an income approach methodology that estimates the projected cash flows of the business attributable to the gaming license intangible asset which is net of charges for the use of other identifiable assets of the business including working capital fixed assets and other intangible assets the replacement cost of the gaming license was used as an indicator of fair value 

trade receivables and payables and other current and noncurrent assets and liabilities were valued at the existing carrying values as they represented the estimated fair value of those items at the acquisition date assets and liabilities held for sale are recorded at fair value less costs to sell based on the agreements reached as of the acquisition date or an income approach 

the fair value of the financing obligations were calculated as the net present value of both the fixed base rent payments and the forecasted variable payments plus the expected residual value of the land and building returned at the end of the expected usage period 

the fair value of land was determined using the sales comparable approach the market data is then adjusted for any significant differences to the extent known between the identified comparable sites and the site being valued the value of building and site improvements was estimated via the income approach other personal property assets such as furniture gaming and computer equipment fixtures computer software and restaurant equipment were valued using the cost approach which is based on replacement or reproduction costs of the asset the cost approach is an estimation of fair value developed by computing the current cost of replacing a property and subtracting any depreciation resulting from one or more of the following factors physical deterioration functional obsolescence andor economic obsolescence 

cash flow estimates are significant to many valuations described above and may include forecasts with assumptions regarding factors such as recent and budgeted operating performance future growth rates and the determination of appropriate discount rates to estimate fair value these inputs involve significant assumptions including the future effects of covid19 as well as the realization of synergies anticipated from a business combination which may not be realized as projected certain assumptions such as the effects of covid19 may be beyond our control 

fair value measurements 

the 5 convertible notes contain derivative features that require bifurcation we estimate the fair value of the 5 convertible notes using a marketbased approach that incorporates the value of both straight debt and conversion features of the notes the valuation model incorporates actively traded prices of the 5 convertible notes as of the reporting date the value of cei’s equity into which these notes could convert and assumptions regarding the incremental cost of borrowing for cei the fair value of the 5 convertible notes derivative liability is subject to interest rate and market price risk due to the conversion features of the notes and other factors generally as the fair value of fixed interest rate debt increases due to a decrease in interest rates the derivative liability decreases and as the fair value of fixed interest rate debt decreases due to an increase in interest rates the derivative liability increases the fair value of the 5 convertible notes derivative liability may also increase as the market price of our stock rises or due to increased volatility in our stock price which will result in a loss recognized in our statement of operations and decrease as the market price of our stock falls or due to decreased volatility in our stock price which will result in income recognized in our statement of operations on october 6 2017 former caesars issued 11 billion aggregate principal amount of 5 convertible notes as of december 31 2020 the fair value of the derivative associated with the 5 convertible notes was 326 million when the price per share of our common stock was 7427 during the year ended december 31 2020 we recognized a loss of 111 million associated to the changes in fair value of the derivative as a result of fluctuations in the share price of our common stock 

we use interest rate swaps which are derivative instruments classified as hedging transactions to limit our exposure to interest rate risk derivative instruments are recognized in the financial statements at fair value the estimated fair values of our derivative instruments are based on market prices obtained from dealer quotes such quotes represent the estimated amounts we would receive or pay to terminate the contracts our derivative instruments contain a credit risk that the counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the agreements we minimize that risk by evaluating the creditworthiness of our counterparties which are limited to major banks and financial institutions the fair values of our derivative instruments are adjusted for the credit rating of the counterparty if the derivative is an asset or adjusted for the credit rating of the company if the derivative is a liability 

see note 8 for more details regarding fair value measurements and item 7a for quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

income taxes 

we and our subsidiaries file income tax returns with federal state and foreign jurisdictions our income tax returns are subject to examination by the internal revenue service “irs” and other tax authorities positions taken in tax returns are sometimes subject to uncertainty in the tax laws and may not ultimately be accepted by the irs or other tax authorities see note 17 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the status and impact of examinations by tax authorities 

we record income taxes under the asset and liability method whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and as attributable to operating loss and tax credit carryforwards we reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if based on the available evidence it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized accordingly the need to establish valuation allowances for deferred tax assets is assessed periodically based on the “more likely than not” realization threshold this assessment considers among other matters the nature frequency and severity of current and cumulative losses forecasts of future profitability the duration of statutory carryforward periods our experience with operating loss and tax credit carryforwards not expiring unused and tax planning alternatives 

when there is a recent history of operating losses and negative normalized earnings and a return to operating profitability has not yet been demonstrated we cannot rely on projections of future taxable earnings for purposes of assessing recoverability of our deferred tax assets in such cases we use systematic and logical methods to estimate when deferred tax liabilities will reverse and generate taxable income and when deferred tax assets will reverse and generate tax deductions our most significant deferred tax asset relates to the failed saleleaseback obligation with vici and glpi see note 10 the reversal of this deferred tax asset requires judgment and estimates and has a material impact on the determination of the amount of valuation allowance required 

under the applicable accounting standards we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is morelikelythannot that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement the accounting standards also provide guidance on derecognition classification interest and penalties on income taxes accounting in interim periods and disclosure requirements for uncertain tax positions 

longlived assets 

we have significant capital invested in our longlived assets and judgments are made in determining the estimated useful lives of assets salvage values to be assigned to assets and if or when an asset has been impaired the accuracy of these estimates affects the amount of depreciation and amortization expense recognized in our financial results and whether we have a gain or loss on the disposal of an asset we assign lives to our assets based on our standard policy which is established by management as representative of the useful life of each category of asset we review the carrying value of our longlived assets whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition the factors considered by management in performing this assessment include current operating results trends and prospects planned construction and renovation projects as well as the effect of obsolescence demand competition and other economic legal and regulatory factors in estimating expected future cash flows for determining whether an asset is impaired assets are grouped at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows which for most of our assets is the individual property see note 6 for additional information 

goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets 

assessing goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment is a process that requires significant judgment and involves detailed qualitative and quantitative businessspecific analysis and many individual assumptions which fluctuate between assessments 

we determine the estimated fair value of each reporting unit based on a combination of ebitda valuation multiples and estimated future cash flows discounted at rates commensurate with the capital structure and cost of capital of comparable market participants giving appropriate consideration to the prevailing borrowing rates within the casino industry in general we also evaluate the aggregate fair value of all of our reporting units and other nonoperating assets in comparison to our aggregate debt and equity market capitalization at the test date ebitda multiples and discounted cash flows are common measures used to value businesses in our industry 

we determine the fair value of our indefinitelived intangible assets using either the relief from royalty method or the excess earnings method under the income approach or replacement cost market approach the determination of fair value of our reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets requires management to make significant assumptions and estimates around the forecasts as well as the selection of discount rates and valuation multiples changes in these estimates could have a significant impact on the fair value of our reporting units and intangible assets and the amount of goodwill or indefinitelived intangible asset impairments if any 

forecasts and the determination of appropriate discount rates and valuation multiples used to determine the fair value of our reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets involves significant assumptions and estimates assumptions include those used assess future effects of covid19 as well as the realization of synergies anticipated from the merger which may not be realized at the projected rate 

as a result of declines in recent performance and the expected impact on future cash flows as a result of covid19 we recognized impairment charges in our regional segment related to goodwill and trade names totaling 100 million and 16 million respectively during the year ended december 31 2020 

as a result of the agreement to sell baton rouge an impairment charge totaling 50 million was recorded during the year ended december 31 2020 due to the carrying value exceeding the estimated net sales proceeds the impairment charges resulted in a reduction to the carrying amounts of the rightofuse assets property and equipment goodwill and other intangibles totaling 1 million 47 million and 2 million respectively recorded in the regional segment 

as a result of the agreement to sell montbleu an impairment charge totaling 45 million was recorded during the year ended december 31 2020 due to the carrying value exceeding the estimated net sales proceeds the impairment charges resulted in a reduction to the carrying amounts of the rightofuse assets property and equipment goodwill and other intangibles totaling 18 million 23 million and 4 million respectively recorded in the regional segment 

we acquired former caesars on july 20 2020 and allocated the total purchase consideration transferred to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values including goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets and therefore the fair value of the former caesars reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets do not significantly exceed their respective carrying values as of october 1 2020 two other reporting units in the regional segment with goodwill totaling 208 million had fair values that did not significantly exceed their respective carrying values to the extent gaming volumes deteriorate in the near future discount rates increase significantly or we do not meet our projected performance we may recognize further impairments and such impairments could be material see note 7 for additional information 

allowance for doubtful accounts  gaming 

we reserve an estimated amount for gaming receivables that may not be collected to reduce the company’s receivables to their net carrying amount methodologies for estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts range from specific reserves to various percentages applied to aged receivables historical collection rates are considered as are customer relationships in determining specific reserves as with many estimates management must make judgments about potential actions by third parties in establishing and evaluating our reserves for allowance for doubtful accounts as of december 31 2020 a 5 increase or decrease to the allowance determined based on a percentage of aged receivables would change the reserve by approximately 14 million 

selfinsurance reserves 

we are selfinsured for various levels of general liability employee medical insurance coverage and workers’ compensation coverage insurance claims and reserves include accruals of estimated settlements for known claims as well as accruals of estimates for claims incurred but not yet reported we utilize independent consultants to assist management in its determination of estimated insurance liabilities while the total cost of claims incurred depends on future developments in managements’ opinion recorded reserves are adequate to cover future claims payments selfinsurance reserves for employee medical claims and workers’ compensations are included in accrued payroll and related on the consolidated balance sheets selfinsurance reserves for general liability claims are included in accrued other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets 

due to the novel nature of the disruption resulting from the covid19 public health emergency actuarial data is limited for determining its effect the assumptions utilized by our actuaries are subject to significant uncertainty and if outcomes differ from these assumptions or events develop or progress in a negative manner the company could experience a material adverse effect and additional liabilities may be recorded in the future alternatively as a result of the current work stoppages a reduction of claims in future periods could be beneficial to our financial condition and results of operations 

litigation claims and assessments 

we utilize estimates for litigation claims and assessments these estimates are based on our knowledge and experience regarding current and past events as well as assumptions about future events if our assessment of such a matter should change we may have to change the estimates which may have an adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows actual results could differ from these estimates

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices such as interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily from variable rate longterm debt arrangements our exposure to foreign exchange risk is primarily attributable to funds held in operating and escrow accounts which are denominated in british pounds gbp 

interest rate risk 

as of december 31 2020 the face value of our longterm debt was 150 billion including variablerate longterm borrowings of 64 billion no amounts were outstanding under our revolving credit facilities 

as a result of the merger we assumed former caesars’ interest rate swaps of which seven interest rate swap agreements are currently in place to fix the interest rate on 23 billion of variable rate debt as a result net of these interest rate swaps 41 billion of debt remains subject to variable interest rates as of december 31 2020 for the term of the agreements see note 12 for additional information the difference to be paid or received under the terms of the interest rate swap agreements is accrued as interest rates change and recognized as an adjustment to interest expense as settlements occur changes in the variable interest rates to be received pursuant to the terms of the interest rate swap agreements will have a corresponding effect on future cash flows 

we do not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 

the table below provides information as of december 31 2020 about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates including the cash flows associated with amortization the notional amounts of interest rate derivative instruments and related weighted average interest rates principal amounts are used to calculate the payments to be exchanged under the related agreements and weighted average variable rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve as of december 31 2020 and should not be considered a predictor of actual future interest rates 



 

a these amounts represent the interest rate swap notional amounts that mature at the end of each respective year see note 12 for additional information 

as of december 31 2020 borrowings outstanding under our credit facilities were variablerate borrowings assuming a 100 basispoint increase in libor our annual interest cost would change by 41 million based on gross amounts outstanding at december 31 2020 

libor is expected to be discontinued after 2021 the interest rate per annum applicable to loans under our credit facilities are at our option either libor plus a margin or a base rate plus a margin the credit facilities permit the administrative agent to select in its reasonable discretion an alternative base rate in the event that libor is discontinued but there can be no assurances as to what alternative base rates may be and whether such base rate will be more or less favorable than libor and any other unforeseen impacts of the potential discontinuation of libor we intend to continue monitoring the developments with respect to the potential phasing out of libor after 2021 and work with our lenders to ensure any transition away from libor will have minimal impact on our financial condition but can provide no assurances regarding the impact of the discontinuation of libor 

foreign exchange rate risks 

the company entered into a foreign exchange forward contract to hedge the risk of appreciation of the gbp denominated purchase price related to william hill on october 9 2020 the company entered into a foreign exchange forward contract to purchase £536 million at a contracted exchange rate as of december 31 2020 the forward contract was valued at 40 million and was recorded in other longterm assets a corresponding unrealized gain of 40 million related to the change in fair value was recorded in the other loss income in the statement of operations  

as of december 31 2020  we held approximately 25 billion of cash cash equivalents and restricted cash denominated in gbp although these funds are subject to changes in foreign exchange rates such risk is expected to be mitigated as we anticipate using these funds for the purchase price of william hill which is also denominated in gbp

risk factors relating to our operations

our business is sensitive to reductions in discretionary consumer spending as a result of downturns in the economy and other factors outside our control

consumer demand for casino hotel and racetrack properties such as ours is particularly sensitive to downturns in the economy and the associated impact on discretionary spending on leisure activities changes in discretionary consumer spending or consumer preferences brought about by factors such as perceived or actual general economic conditions effects of declines in consumer confidence in the economy the impact of high energy and food costs the increased cost of travel decreased disposable consumer income and wealth fears of war and future acts of terrorism or widespread illnesses or epidemics including the coronavirus could further reduce customer demand for the amenities that we offer in addition increases in gasoline prices including increases prompted by global political and economic instabilities can adversely affect our operations because most of our patrons travel to our properties by car or on airlines that may pass on increases in fuel costs to passengers in the form of higher ticket prices further security concerns terrorist attacks widespread illnesses or epidemics including the coronavirus and other geopolitical events can have a material adverse effect on leisure and business travel discretionary spending and other areas of economic behavior that directly impact the gaming and entertainment industries in general and our business in particular economic downturns geopolitical events and other related factors which impact discretionary consumer spending and other economic events that are beyond our control have had direct effects on our business and the tourism industry in the past and could adversely affect us in the future

 

we face substantial competition in the hotel and casino industry and expect that such competition will continue  

the gaming industry is characterized by an increasingly high degree of competition and competition is intense in most of the markets in which we operate we compete with a variety of gaming operations including landbased casinos dockside casinos riverboat casinos casinos located on racing tracks and casinos located on native american reservations and other forms of legalized gaming such as video gaming terminals vgts at bars restaurants and truck stops and mobile gambling and sports betting we also compete to a lesser extent with other forms of legalized gaming and entertainment such as bingo pull tab games card parlors sports books fantasy sports websites “cruisetonowhere” operations parimutuel or telephonic betting on horse racing and dog racing statesponsored lotteries jaialai and in the future may compete with gaming at other venues in addition we compete more generally with other forms of entertainment for the discretionary spending of our customers certain of our competitors are large gaming companies with greater name recognition and marketing and financial resources in some instances particularly in the case of native american casinos our competitors pay lower taxes or no taxes these factors create additional challenges for us in competing for customers and accessing cash flow or financing to fund improvements for our casino and entertainment product that enable us to remain competitive

states that already have legalized casino gaming may further expand gaming and other states that have not yet legalized gaming may do so in the future there has been significant competition in our markets as a result of the expansion of facilities by existing market participants the entrance of new gaming participants into a market or legislative changes in prior years for example in recent years a number of states including illinois pennsylvania and ohio have either approved casino gaming or substantially expanded gaming by authorizing additional casino licenses and vgts at horse racing tracks truck stops or other locations additionally we also compete with native american gaming operations in california and other jurisdictions where native american tribes operate largescale gaming facilities or otherwise conduct gaming activities on native american lands further expansion of legalized casino gaming in states and on native american reservations in or near our markets or changes to gaming laws in states in which we have operations and in states near our operations could increase competition and could adversely affect our operations 

further we face increasing competition as a result of the expansion of legalized online gaming and sports betting in the last few years online gaming has been approved in several states where we have casino properties including iowa nevada and new jersey and a number of states including indiana iowa colorado new jersey and nevada permit online sports betting we expect that other states will adopt legislation that permits online sports betting and gaming which will result in significant additional competition for our casino properties

increased competition may require us to make substantial capital expenditures to maintain and enhance the competitive positions of our properties to increase the attractiveness and add to the appeal of our facilities because a significant portion of our cash flow is required to pay obligations under our outstanding indebtedness and the master lease there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient funds to undertake these expenditures or that we will be able to obtain sufficient financing to fund such expenditures if we are unable to make such expenditures our competitive position could be negatively affected

our operations in certain jurisdictions depend on agreements with third parties

our operations in several jurisdictions depend on agreements with third parties if we are unable to renew these agreements on satisfactory terms as they expire our business may be disrupted and in the event of disruptions in multiple jurisdictions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations for example iowa law requires that each gambling venue in iowa must have a licensed “qualified sponsoring organization” or “qso” which is a taxexempt nonprofit organization the qso must donate the profits it receives from casino operations to educational civic public charitable patriotic or religious uses both of our iowa properties have an agreement with a local qso we have the right to renew our agreements for bettendorf and waterloo when they expire in 2025 and 2021 respectively 

the federal interstate horse racing act and the state racing laws in certain jurisdictions where we have racetracks require that in order to simulcast races we have written agreements with the horse owners and trainers at those racetracks or that we share proceeds of slot machines at the applicable racetrack if we fail to maintain operative agreements with the horsemen at our racetracks we will not be permitted to conduct live racing and export and import simulcasting and may not be permitted to continue our gaming operations at the applicable racetrack at those facilities which could have material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

 

some of our casinos are located on leased property if we default on one or more leases the applicable lessors could terminate the affected leases and we could lose possession of the affected casino 

we currently lease certain parcels of land on which several of our properties are located including five of the properties that we acquired in the tropicana acquisition as a ground lessee we have the right to use the leased land however we do not hold fee ownership of the underlying land accordingly we have no interest in the leased land or improvements thereon at the expiration of the ground leases moreover since we do not completely control the land underlying the property a landowner could take certain actions to disrupt our rights in the land leased under the longterm leases which are beyond our control if the entity owning any leased land chose to disrupt our use either permanently or for a significant period of time then the value of our assets could be impaired and our business and operations could be adversely affected our leases provide that they may be terminated for a number of reasons including failure to pay rent taxes or other payment obligations or the breach of other covenants contained in the leases in particular the master lease requires annual rent payments of at least 876 million which is subject to escalation annually and obligates us to make specified minimum capital expenditures with respect to the leased properties if our business and properties fail to generate sufficient earnings the payments required to service the rent obligations under the master lease could materially and adversely limit our ability to react to changes in our business and make acquisitions and investments in our properties if we were to default on any one or more of these leases the applicable lessors could terminate the affected leases and we could lose possession of the affected land and any improvements on the land including the hotels and casinos a termination of our ground leases or the master lease could result in a default under our debt agreements and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations further in the event that any lessor of our leased properties including properties that are subject to the master lease encounters financial operational regulatory or other challenges there can be no assurance that such lessor will be able to comply with its obligations under the applicable lease

certain of our leases including the master lease are “triplenet” leases accordingly in addition to rent we are required to pay among other things the following 1 lease payments to the underlying ground lessor for properties that are subject to ground leases 2 facility maintenance costs 3 all insurance premiums for insurance with respect to the leased properties and the business conducted on the leased properties 4 taxes levied on or with respect to the leased properties other than taxes on the income of the lessor and 5 all utilities and other services necessary or appropriate for the leased properties and the business conducted on the leased properties we are responsible for incurring the costs described in the preceding sentence notwithstanding the fact that many of the benefits received in exchange for such costs shall in part accrue to the lessor as the owner of the associated facilities in addition we remain obligated for lease payments and other obligations under the master lease and other ground leases even if one or more of such leased facilities is unprofitable or if we decide to withdraw from those locations we could incur special charges relating to the closing of such facilities including lease termination costs impairment charges and other special charges that would reduce our net income and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

we are subject to extensive federal state and local regulation and licensing and gaming authorities have significant control over our operations which could have an adverse effect on our business

licensing requirements  the ownership and operation of casino gaming riverboat and horse racing facilities are subject to extensive federal state and local regulation and regulatory authorities at the federal state and local levels have broad powers with respect to the licensing of gaming businesses and may revoke suspend condition or limit our gaming or other licenses impose substantial fines and take other actions each of which poses a significant risk to our business financial condition and results of operations we currently hold all state and local licenses and related approvals necessary to conduct our present gaming operations but we must periodically apply to renew many of our licenses and registrations we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such renewals any failure to maintain or renew our existing licenses registrations permits or approvals would have a material adverse effect on us furthermore if additional laws or regulations are adopted or existing laws or regulations are amended or interpreted differently these regulations could impose additional restrictions or costs that could have a significant adverse effect on us 

gaming authorities with jurisdiction over our operations may in their discretion require the holder of any securities issued by us to file applications be investigated and be found suitable to own our securities if they have reason to believe that the security ownership would be inconsistent with the declared policies of their respective jurisdictions further the costs of any investigation conducted by any of the gaming authorities under these circumstances must be paid by the applicant and refusal or failure to pay these charges may constitute grounds for a finding that the applicant is unsuitable to own the securities if any of the gaming authorities determines that a person is unsuitable to own our securities then under the applicable gaming or horse racing laws and regulations we can be sanctioned including the loss of approvals that are required for us to continue our gaming operations in the relevant jurisdictions if such unsuitable person does not timely sell our securities

 

our officers directors and key employees are also subject to a variety of regulatory requirements and various licensing and related approval procedures in the various jurisdictions in which we operate gaming facilities if any of the applicable gaming authorities were to find an officer director or key employee of ours unsuitable for licensing or unsuitable to continue having a relationship with us we would have to sever all relationships with that person furthermore the gaming authorities may require us to terminate the employment of any person who refuses to file appropriate applications either result could materially adversely affect our gaming operations 

applicable gaming laws and regulations restrict our ability to issue securities incur debt and undertake other financing activities such transactions would generally require approval of applicable gaming authorities and our financing counterparties including lenders might be subject to various licensing and related approval procedures in the various jurisdictions in which we operate gaming facilities if state regulatory authorities were to find any person unsuitable with regard to his her or its relationship to us or any of our subsidiaries we would be required to sever our relationships with that person which could materially adversely affect our business

compliance with other laws  we are also subject to a variety of other federal state and local laws rules regulations and ordinances that apply to nongaming businesses including zoning environmental construction and landuse laws and regulations governing smoking and the serving of alcoholic beverages legislation in various forms to ban indoor tobacco smoking has been enacted or introduced in many states and local jurisdictions including several of the jurisdictions in which we operate if additional restrictions on smoking are enacted in our jurisdictions we could experience a significant decrease in gaming revenue and particularly if such restrictions are not applicable to all competitive facilities in that gaming market our business could be materially adversely affected under various federal state and local laws and regulations an owner or operator of real property may be held liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances or wastes located on its property regardless of whether or not the present owner or operator knows of or is responsible for the presence of such substances or wastes we have not identified any issues associated with our properties that could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on us or the results of our operations however several of our properties are located in industrial areas or were used for industrial purposes for many years as a consequence it is possible that historical or neighboring activities have affected one or more of our properties and that as a result environmental issues could arise in the future the precise nature of which we cannot now predict the coverage and attendant compliance costs associated with these laws regulations and ordinances may result in future additional costs 

regulations adopted by the us department of treasury financial crimes enforcement network “fincen” require us to report currency transactions in excess of 10000 occurring within a gaming day including identification of the patron by name and social security number us treasury department regulations also require us to report certain suspicious activity including any transaction that exceeds 5000 if we know suspect or have reason to believe that the transaction involves funds from illegal activity or is designed to evade federal regulations or reporting requirements substantial penalties can be imposed if we fail to comply with these regulations fincen has recently increased its focus on gaming companies

we are required to report certain customer’s gambling winnings via form w2g to comply with current internal revenue service regulations should these regulations change we would expect to incur additional costs to comply with the revised reporting requirements

taxation and fees  in addition gaming companies are generally subject to significant revenuebased taxes and fees in addition to normal federal state and local income taxes and such taxes and fees are subject to increase at any time we pay substantial taxes and fees with respect to our operations from time to time federal state and local legislators and officials have proposed changes in tax laws or in the administration of such laws affecting the gaming industry in addition worsening economic conditions could intensify the efforts of state and local governments to raise revenues through increases in gaming taxes andor property taxes it is not possible to determine with certainty the likelihood of changes in tax laws or in the administration of such laws such changes if adopted could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations the large number of state and local governments with significant current or projected budget deficits makes it more likely that those governments that currently permit gaming will seek to fund such deficits with new or increased gaming taxes andor property taxes and worsening economic conditions could intensify those efforts any material increase or the adoption of additional taxes or fees could have a material adverse effect on our future financial results 

 

income taxes we are subject to tax in multiple us tax jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes deferred tax assets or liabilities and in evaluating our tax positions while we believe our tax positions are consistent with the tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business it is possible that these positions may be overturned by jurisdictional tax authorities which may have a significant impact on our provision for income taxes 

tax laws are dynamic and subject to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of the law are issued or applied the us recently enacted significant tax reform and certain provisions of the new law may adversely affect us in addition governmental tax authorities are increasingly scrutinizing the tax positions of companies if us or state tax authorities change applicable tax laws our overall taxes could increase and our business financial condition or results of operations may be adversely impacted

we have partnership agreements to expand our sportsbook business and engage in online sportsbook casino gaming and poker there can be no assurance that regulations authorizing such activities will be approved in the jurisdictions in which we operate or that the market for such gaming activities will develop as expected

during the second quarter of 2018 the us supreme court overturned the federal ban on sports betting as a result several jurisdictions in which we operate legalized sports betting and additional jurisdictions may do so in the future we currently accept wagers on sporting events in nevada new jersey mississippi iowa and indiana however our ability to expand our sports betting and online operations is dependent on adoption of regulations permitting sports betting in the united states and may be negatively impacted by a recent opinion of the us justice department’s office of legal counsel relating to the restrictions on online gaming under existing federal statutes there can be no assurances when or if regulations enabling sports betting and online sportsbook casino gaming and poker will be adopted or the terms of such regulations in certain of the jurisdictions in which we operate 

following the repeal of the federal ban on sports betting we entered into a definitive agreement with william hill pursuant to which william hill has agreed to operate as our sports betting operator including with respect to mobile and online sports wagering for a period of 25 years we also entered into a 20year agreement with tsg pursuant to which we agreed to provide tsg with options to obtain access to certain of our licenses for online sports wagering and real money online gaming and poker we received equity interests in william hill us william hill plc and tsg in consideration for the execution of these agreements and we may in the future receive additional consideration including revenue sharing based on the betting and gaming operations conducted under the authority of our licenses or in our markets to the extent permitted under our agreements with william hill and tsg we will continue to evaluate options for additional partnerships to operate online betting and gaming activities under the authority of our licenses and may in the future enter into additional partnership agreements with respect to such operations 

the market for sports betting and online gaming is rapidly evolving and highly competitive with an increasing number of competitors the success of our sportsbook and online betting and gaming partners the value of our equity interests in william hill and tsg and the results of operations from sports betting and online sportsbook and gaming conducted at our properties or under the authority of our licenses are dependent on a number of factors that are beyond our control including















there can be no assurance as to the returns that we will receive from our current and anticipated sports betting and online gaming operations or our partnerships with william hill and tsg or future similar arrangements with other market service providers

 

we rely on our key personnel and we may face difficulties in attracting and retaining qualified employees for our casinos and race tracks  

our future success will depend upon among other things our ability to keep our senior executives and highly qualified employees we compete with other potential employers for employees and we may not succeed in hiring or retaining the executives and other employees that we need a sudden loss of or inability to replace key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operation

in addition the operation of our business requires qualified executives managers and skilled employees with gaming and horse racing industry experience and qualifications who are able to obtain the requisite licenses and approval from the applicable gaming authorities there has from time to time been a shortage of skilled labor in our markets in addition to limitations that may otherwise exist in the supply of skilled labor the continued expansion of gaming near our facilities including the expansion of native american gaming may make it more difficult for us to attract qualified individuals while we believe that we will continue to be able to attract and retain qualified employees shortages of skilled labor will make it increasingly difficult and expensive to attract and retain the services of a satisfactory number of qualified employees and we may incur higher costs than expected as a result

work stoppages organizing drives and other labor problems could negatively impact our future profits

as of december 31 2019 we had 18 collective bargaining agreements covering approximately 3100 employees a lengthy strike or other work stoppages at any of our casino properties could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations given the large number of employees labor unions are making a concerted effort to recruit more employees in the gaming industry including at some of our properties as a result we cannot provide any assurance that we will not experience additional and more successful union organization activity in the future

because we own real property we will be subject to extensive environmental regulation which creates uncertainty regarding future environmental expenditures and liabilities

we are subject to various federal state and local environmental health and safety laws and regulations that govern activities that may have adverse environmental effects such as discharges to air and water as well as the use storage discharge emission and disposal of solid animal and hazardous wastes and exposure to hazardous materials these laws and regulations are complex and frequently subject to change in addition our horse racing facilities are subject to laws and regulations that address the impacts of manure and wastewater generated by concentrated animal feeding operations “cafo” on water quality including but not limited to storm water discharges cafo regulations include permit requirements and water quality discharge standards enforcement of cafo regulations has been receiving increased governmental attention compliance with these and other environmental laws can in some circumstances require significant capital expenditures we have from time to time been responsible for investigating and remediating or contributing to remediation costs related to contamination located at or near certain of our facilities including contamination related to underground storage tanks and groundwater contamination arising from prior uses of land on which certain of our facilities are located in addition we have been and may in the future be required to manage abate remove or contain manure and wastewater generated by concentrated animal feeding operations due to our racetrack operations mold lead asbestos‑containing materials or other hazardous conditions found in or on our properties moreover violations can result in significant fines or penalties and in some instances interruption or cessation of operations

we are also subject to laws and regulations that create liability and cleanup responsibility for releases of regulated materials into the environment certain of these laws and regulations impose strict and under certain circumstances joint and several liability on a current or previous owner or operator of property for the costs of remediating regulated materials on or emanating from its property the costs of investigation remediation or removal of those substances may be substantial

 

an earthquake hurricane flood other natural disaster act of terrorism or other casualty events could adversely affect our business and we may not have sufficient insurance coverage to cover such losses  

the operations of our facilities are subject to disruption or reduced patronage as a result of severe weather conditions natural disasters and other casualty events including acts of terrorism or violence the reno area has been and may in the future be subject to earthquakes and other natural disasters and certain of our other properties are located in flood zones or are otherwise subject to significant disruption based on adverse weather conditions because many of our gaming operations are located on or adjacent to bodies of water these facilities are subject to risks in addition to those associated with other casinos including loss of service due to casualty forces of nature mechanical failure extended or extraordinary maintenance flood hurricane or other severe weather conditions and other disasters for example flooding along the mississippi river can impact six or more of our properties and result in them being closed for differing periods of time our properties in florida mississippi louisiana and new jersey are particularly vulnerable to hurricanes wind and storm surge our pompano property was closed for four days in 2017 because of storms in addition severe weather such as high winds and blizzards occasionally limits access to our landbased facilities in colorado and reno inadequate insurance or lack of available insurance for these and other certain types or levels of risk could expose us to significant losses in the event that a catastrophe occurred for which we are underinsured further if properties subject to the master lease are impacted by a casualty event the master lease requires us to repair or restore the affected properties even if the cost of such repair or restoration exceeds the insurance proceeds that we receive under such circumstances the rent under the master lease is required to be paid during the period of repair or restoration even if all or a portion of the affected property is not operating in addition to the damage caused to our properties by a casualty loss we may suffer business disruption as a result of the casualty event or be subject to claims by third parties that may be injured or harmed while we carry general liability insurance and business interruption insurance there can be no assurance that insurance will be available or adequate to cover all loss and damage to which our business or our assets might be subjected in addition certain casualty events such as labor strikes nuclear events loss of income due to terrorism violence deterioration or corrosion insect or animal damage and pollution may not be covered under our policies any losses we incur that are not adequately covered by insurance may decrease our future operating income require us to fund replacements or repairs for destroyed property and reduce the funds available for payments of our obligations further we renew our insurance policies on an annual basis the cost of coverage may become so high that we may need to further reduce our policy limits or agree to certain exclusions from coverage among other factors it is possible that regional political tensions homeland security concerns other catastrophic events or any change in government legislation governing insurance coverage for acts of terrorism could materially adversely affect available insurance coverage and result in increased premiums on available coverage which may cause us to elect to reduce our policy limits additional exclusions from coverage or higher deductibles among other potential future adverse changes in the future we may elect to not or may not be able to obtain any coverage for losses due to acts of terrorism

we are subject to risks relating to mechanical failure forces of nature casualty extraordinary maintenance and other causes

all of our facilities will generally be subject to the risk that operations could be halted for a temporary or extended period of time as the result of casualty forces of nature mechanical failure or extended or extraordinary maintenance among other causes in addition our gaming operations could be damaged or halted due to extreme weather conditions these risks are particularly pronounced at our riverboat and dockside facilities because of their locations on and adjacent to water

our reliance on our computer systems and software could expose us to great financial harm if any of our computer systems or software were subject to any material disruption or corruption

 

we rely significantly on our computer systems and software to receive and properly process internal and external data including data related to our player loyalty program a disruption or corruption of the proper functioning of our computer systems or software could cause us to lose data or record erroneous data which could result in material losses we cannot guarantee that our efforts to maintain competitive computer systems and software will be successful our computer systems and software may fail or be subject to bugs or other errors resulting in service interruptions or other unintended consequences if any of these risks materialize they could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

 

 

we are or may become involved in legal proceedings that if adversely adjudicated or settled could impact our business and financial condition  

from time to time we are named in lawsuits or other legal proceedings relating to our respective businesses in particular the nature of our business subjects us to the risk of lawsuits filed by customers past and present employees competitors business partners and others in the ordinary course of business as with all legal proceedings no assurances can be given as to the outcome of these matters moreover legal proceedings can be expensive and time consuming and we may not be successful in defending or prosecuting these lawsuits which could result in settlements or damages that could significantly impact our business financial condition and results of operations

our information technology and other systems are subject to cyber security risk including misappropriation of customer information or other breaches of information security

we collect information relating to our guests and employees for various business purposes including marketing and promotional purposes the collection and use of personal data are governed by privacy laws and regulations enacted in the united states we rely on information technology and other systems to maintain and transmit this personal and financial information credit card settlements credit card funds transmissions mailing lists and reservations information our information and processes are subject to the everchanging threat of compromised security in the form of a risk of potential breach system failure computer virus or unauthorized or fraudulent use by customers company employees or employees of thirdparty vendors we face cybersecurity threats which may range from uncoordinated individual attempts to sophisticated and targeted measures directed at us cyberattacks and security breaches may include but are not limited to attempts to access information including customer and company information computer malware such as viruses denial of service ransomware attacks that encrypt exfiltrate or otherwise render data unusable or unavailable in an effort to extort money or other consideration as a condition to purportedly returning the data to a usable form operator errors or misuse or inadvertent releases of data and other forms of electronic security breaches the steps we take to deter and mitigate these risks may not be successful and any resulting compromise or loss of data or systems could adversely impact operations or regulatory compliance and could result in remedial expenses fines litigation and loss of reputation potentially impacting our financial results

in addition third party service providers and other business partners process and maintain proprietary business information and data related to our guests suppliers and other business partners our information technology and other systems that maintain and transmit this information or those of service providers or business partners may also be compromised by a malicious thirdparty penetration of our network security or that of a third party service provider or business partner or impacted by intentional or unintentional actions or inactions by our employees or those of a third party service provider or business partner as a result our business information guest supplier and other business partner data may be lost disclosed accessed or taken without their consent

any such loss disclosure or misappropriation of or access to guests’ or business partners’ information or other breach of our information security can result in legal claims or legal proceedings including regulatory investigations and actions may have a serious impact on our reputation and may adversely affect our businesses operating results and financial condition furthermore the loss disclosure or misappropriation of our business information may adversely affect our reputation businesses operating results and financial condition  

our operations are vulnerable to fraud and cheating

to increase winnings gaming customers of ours may attempt or commit fraud or cheat such attempts could involve tactics including the use of counterfeit chips possibly in collusion with our employees internal acts of cheating could also be conducted by employees through collusion with dealers surveillance staff floor managers or other casino or gaming area staff our failure to discover such acts or schemes in a timely manner could result in losses in our gaming operations moreover our reputation could be adversely affected by negative publicity related to such schemes potentially causing a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows

 

our operations have historically been subject to seasonal variations and quarterly fluctuations in operating results and we can expect to experience such variations and fluctuations in the future  

historically our operations have typically been subject to seasonal variations our strongest operating results for our reno properties have generally occurred in the second and third quarters and the weakest results have generally occurred during the period from november through february when weather conditions adversely affected operating results winter conditions can frequently adversely affect transportation routes to reno where a significant of our visitors arrive by ground transportation and certain of our other properties and cause cancellations of live horse racing for example the renotahoe area experienced exceptionally high levels of snowfall in the first quarter of 2017 with certain resorts in the tahoe area reporting over 50 feet of snowfall during such time which adversely affected visitation to our reno properties and adversely affected our results of operations for the first quarter of 2017 as a result unfavorable seasonal conditions could have a material adverse effect on our operations

the concentration and evolution of the slot machine manufacturing industry could impose additional costs on us

there are a limited number of slot machine manufacturers servicing the gaming industry and a large majority of our revenues are derived from slot machines at our casinos it is important for competitive reasons that we offer the most popular and uptodate slot machine games with the latest technology to customers 

in recent years slot machine manufacturers have frequently refused to sell slot machines featuring the most popular games instead requiring participating lease arrangements generally a participating lease is substantially more expensive over the longterm than the cost to purchase a new slot machine 

for competitive reasons we may be forced to acquire new slot machines slot machine systems or gaming and hotel technology and equipment or enter into participating lease arrangements that are more expensive than our costs associated with the continued operation of our existing slot machines equipment and software if the newer slot machines equipment or software do not result in sufficient incremental revenues to offset the increased investment or if we are unable to successfully implement new software or technology it could adversely affect our operations and profitability 

we face risks associated with growth and acquisitions

we have grown our operations through a number of strategic acquisitions and we expect that we will continue to evaluate opportunities for growth in existing or new markets through acquiring or developing other gaming entertainment facilities or redeveloping our existing gaming facilities in the future we may also pursue expansion opportunities including joint ventures in jurisdictions where casino gaming is not currently permitted in order to be prepared to develop projects upon approval of casino gaming 

although we only intend to pursue acquisitions and development opportunities that if consummated will be accretive to us and our stockholders we cannot be sure that we will be able to identify attractive acquisition or development opportunities or that we will experience the return on investment that we expect in particular we cannot be sure that we will realize the anticipated synergies and benefits of our acquisitions or that they will be accretive to our results of operations our estimates and assumptions regarding expected synergies and benefits of our acquisitions and development projects could materially change due to factors beyond our control and could delay decrease or eliminate the expected accretive effect of the acquisitions and cause resulting dilution to our earnings per share or negatively impact the price of our common stock

in addition acquisitions require significant management attention and resources to integrate new properties businesses and operations potential difficulties we may encounter as part of the integration process include 







 

in addition it is possible that the integration process could result in 







any of which could adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with customers suppliers employees and other constituencies or our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits or could reduce our earnings or otherwise adversely affect our business and financial results 

there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify acquire develop or profitably manage additional companies or operations or successfully integrate such companies or operations into our existing operations without substantial costs delays or other problems additionally there can be no assurance that we will receive gaming or other necessary licenses or approvals for new projects that we may pursue in addition we may from time to time elect to divest properties that we determine are not core to our operations we cannot be sure that we will be able to sell such noncore assets on terms that result in a return on our investment or at all

we may experience construction delays or cost overruns during our expansion or development projects that could adversely affect our operations

from time to time we may commence development and construction projects on new properties or at our current properties we also evaluate other expansion opportunities as they become available and may in the future engage in additional construction projects as an example our joint venture with cordish intends to master plan and develop a mixeduse entertainment and hospitality destination on unused land adjacent to the pompano casino and racetrack the anticipated costs and construction periods for development and construction projects are based upon budgets conceptual design documents and construction schedule estimates prepared by us or in the case of pompano our joint venture partner in consultation with our architects all of which are subject to assumptions that may be subject to change based on unforeseen circumstances development and construction projects entail significant risks which can substantially increase costs or delay completion of a project such risks include shortages of materials or skilled labor unforeseen engineering environmental or geological problems work stoppages weather interference and unanticipated cost increases most of these factors are beyond our control in addition difficulties or delays in obtaining any of the requisite entitlements licenses permits or authorizations from regulatory authorities can increase the cost or delay the completion of an expansion or development significant budget overruns or delays with respect to expansion and development projects could adversely affect our results of operations

our planned capital expenditures may not result in our expected improvements in our business

we regularly expend capital to construct maintain and renovate our properties to remain competitive maintain the value and brand standards of our properties and comply with applicable laws and regulations our ability to realize the expected returns on our capital investments is dependent on a number of factors including general economic conditions changes to construction plans and specifications delays in obtaining or inability to obtain necessary permits licenses and approvals disputes with contractors disruptions to our business caused by construction and other unanticipated circumstances or cost increases

while we believe that the overall budgets for our planned capital expenditures are reasonable these costs are estimates and the actual costs may be higher than expected in addition we can provide no assurance that these investments will be sufficient or that we will realize our expected returns on our capital investments or any returns at all a failure to realize our expected returns on capital investments could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations

we may incur impairments to goodwill indefinitelived intangible assets or longlived assets which could negatively affect our operating results

as of december 31 2019 we had 20 billion of goodwill and other intangible assets we perform annual impairment testing for goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets as of october 1 of each fiscal year or on an interim basis if indicators of impairment exist for properties with goodwill andor other intangible assets with indefinite lives these tests could require the comparison of the implied fair value of each reporting unit to carrying value 

 

as a result of the sale of certain nonoperating real property located in pennsylvania the company recognized an impairment charge of 10 million during the year ended december 31 2019 

during the third quarter of 2018 as a result of the announced sale to churchill downs incorporated combined with the classification of vicksburg’s operations as assets held for sale an impairment charge totaling 98 million was recorded due to the carrying value exceeding the estimated net sales proceeds the impairment reduced the value of goodwill additionally in conjunction with the agreement to sell our rights and obligations to operate nemacolin an impairment charge totaling 38 million was recorded in 2018 due to the carrying value of the property and equipment being sold exceeding the estimated net sales proceeds

during the fourth quarter of 2017 we recorded an impairment charge totaling 380 million to reduce the carrying value of goodwill andor trade names related to our lake charles lula and vicksburg reporting units

we must make various assumptions and estimates in performing our impairment testing our qualitative assessments including assumptions regarding market and industry conditions and our financial performance our quantitative assessment relies on estimates of future cash flows that are based on reasonable and supportable assumptions which represent our best estimates of the cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets including their eventual disposition and by a market approach based upon valuation multiples for similar companies changes in estimates or market conditions increases in our cost of capital reductions in transaction multiples operating and capital expenditure assumptions or application of alternative assumptions and definitions could produce significantly different results

we also evaluate longlived assets for impairment if indicators of impairment exist in assessing the recoverability of the carrying value of such property equipment and other longlived assets we make assumptions regarding future cash flows and residual values

future cash flow estimates are by their nature subjective and actual results may differ materially from our estimates if our ongoing estimates of future cash flows are not met we may have to record additional impairment charges in future accounting periods our estimates of cash flows are based on the current regulatory social and economic climates recent operating information and budgets and current operating plans of the various properties where we conduct operations these estimates could be negatively impacted by changes in federal state or local regulations economic downturns internal operating decisions or other events affecting various forms of travel and access to our properties

risks related to the caesars acquisition 

the merger agreement subjects us to restrictions on our business activities during the pendency of the merger

the merger agreement subjects us to restrictions on our business activities and obligates us to generally operate our businesses in the ordinary course in all material respects during the pendency of the merger absent caesars’ prior written consent these restrictions could prevent us from pursuing attractive business opportunities or responding effectively to competitive pressures and industry developments that arise prior to the consummation of the merger or termination of the merger agreement and are outside the ordinary course of business in particular the merger agreement restricts us from making certain acquisitions and dispositions and taking other specified actions absent caesars’ prior written consent if we are unable to take actions we believe are beneficial such restrictions could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

delay or failure to consummate the merger would prevent the company from realizing the anticipated benefits of the merger and the company would also remain liable for significant transaction costs

any delay in consummating the merger may increase the cash portion of the merger consideration and adversely impact the combined company’s ability to realize synergies and other benefits that are anticipated if the merger is consummated within the expected timeframe in particular if the applicable closing conditions set forth in the merger agreement are not satisfied by march 25 2020 the amount of cash payable by us as merger consideration per share of caesars common stock will increase by 0003333 for each day from march 25 2020 until the closing date of the merger in addition the market price of our common stock may reflect various market assumptions as to whether and when the merger will be consummated consequently the failure to consummate or any delay in the consummation of the merger could result in significant changes in the market price of our common stock in addition we have incurred and will continue to incur significant costs relating to the merger such as debt commitment ticking legal accounting financial advisor and other fees and to the extent that the debt financing as defined herein is incurred prior to consummation of the merger interest expense in each case that may increase in the event that the consummation of the merger is delayed and will be payable in 

 

the event that the merger is not consummated for example we may elect to issue all or a portion of the debt financing other than the commitments for our new revolving credit facility or 364day secured bridge facility into escrow pending consummation of the merger and satisfaction of the other closing conditions and pursuant to the amended and restated commitment letter  as amended the “ar commitment letter” and the related fee letters for the merger financing and subject to the conditions set forth therein the lenders have the right to require us or our unrestricted subsidiary to issue all or a portion of the debt financing other than the commitments for our new revolving credit facility or 364day secured bridge facility into escrow pending consummation of the merger and satisfaction of the other closing conditions if it has not otherwise closed prior to march 31 2020 issuance of all or any portion of the debt financing prior to the closing of the merger would cause us to incur additional interest expense prior to consummation of the merger which may result in significant additional cost to us moreover  if the merger agreement is terminated in certain circumstances we will be obligated to pay a termination fee to caesars of approximately 8368 million further in the event the mta is terminated because the merger agreement is terminated we are required to pay vici a fee of 750 million pursuant to the terms of the mta 

whether or not the merger is consummated the pendency of the merger could cause disruptions in our business which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

the pendency of the merger could cause disruptions in our business including the following









 

if any of these disruptions were to occur it could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and result of operation

obtaining required approvals and satisfying closing conditions may delay or prevent consummation of the merger

consummation of the merger is subject to various closing conditions including among others i the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period under the hsr act and receipt of required gaming approvals ii the absence of any governmental order or law prohibiting the consummation of the merger iii adoption of the merger agreement by holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of caesars common stock entitled to vote iv the approval by our stockholders of the issuance of shares of our common stock in the merger the “share issuance” v the effectiveness of the registration statement for our common stock to be issued in the merger and the authorization for listing of those shares on the nasdaq stock market vi absence of a material adverse effect on the other party vii the accuracy of the other party’s representations and warranties subject to customary materiality standards viii compliance of the other party with its respective covenants under the merger agreement in all material respects and ix conversion or certain amendments of or another mutually agreed arrangement with respect to caesars’ 500 convertible senior notes due 2024 the caesars stockholders approved the merger agreement and our stockholders approved the share issuance at separate stockholder meetings held on november 15 2019 and the amendments to the caesars 5 convertible senior notes due 2024 have been approved 

if the remaining conditions are not satisfied the merger will not be consummated unless such conditions are validly waived such conditions may jeopardize or delay consummation of the merger or may reduce the anticipated benefits of the merger further no assurance can be given that the required approvals will be obtained or that the conditions to closing will be satisfied even if all such approvals are obtained no assurance can be given as to the terms conditions and timing of such approvals or that they will satisfy the terms of the merger agreement if the merger is not consummated by june 24 2020 as may be extended to a date no later than december 24 2020 upon satisfaction of certain conditions to extension set forth in the merger agreement either we or caesars may terminate the merger agreement and under certain circumstances as set forth in the merger agreement we may be required to pay caesars a termination fee as a result of such termination

 

the merger is subject to the receipt of governmental approvals that may impose conditions that could have an adverse effect on us or if not obtained could prevent consummation of the merger or in some circumstances require us to pay caesars a termination fee of approximately 8368 million 

consummation of the merger is conditioned upon the receipt of certain governmental approvals including without limitation antitrust and gaming regulatory approvals although we and caesars have each agreed to use our reasonable best efforts to obtain the requisite governmental approvals there can be no assurance that these approvals will be obtained and that the other conditions to consummating the merger will be satisfied in addition the governmental authorities from which the regulatory approvals are required may impose conditions on the consummation of the merger including requirements to divest properties or require changes to the terms of the merger agreement or other agreements to be entered into in connection with the merger agreement such conditions or changes and the process of obtaining regulatory approvals could have the effect of delaying or impeding consummation of the merger imposing additional costs or limitations on us following consummation of the merger or materially limiting the revenue of the combined company after the consummation of the merger any of which might reduce the anticipated benefits to us of the merger or have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition if the merger agreement is terminated i due to a law or order relating to gaming or antitrust laws that prohibits or permanently enjoins the consummation of the merger ii because the required regulatory approvals were not obtained prior to june 24 2020 as may be extended to a date no later than december 24 2020 upon satisfaction of certain conditions to extension set forth in the merger agreement or iii due to us willfully and materially breaching certain obligations with respect to the actions required to be taken by us to obtain required antitrust approvals we will be required to pay caesars a termination fee of approximately 8368 million

antitrust approvals that are required to consummate the merger may not be received may take longer than expected or may impose conditions including the requirement to divest assets that could have an adverse effect on the combined company following the merger

under the provisions of the hsr act the merger may not be consummated until filings are made with the antitrust division of the doj and the ftc and the expiration of a 30calendar day waiting period or the early termination of that waiting period following the parties’ filings we and caesars filed our respective notification and report forms under the hsr act on july 16 2019 on august 15 2019 we withdrew our notification and report form and refiled the same on august 19 2019 which began a new 30day waiting period on september 18 2019 each of we and caesars received a request for additional information and documentary material a “second request” from the ftc in connection with the ftc’s review of the merger which extends the waiting period until 30 days after both parties have substantially complied with the second request unless the ftc early terminates the additional waiting period or the parties otherwise agree not to consummate the merger for a period of time after substantial compliance we and caesars are working with the ftc to complete its investigation as soon as practicable 

in addition private parties who may be adversely affected by the merger and individual states may bring legal actions under the antitrust laws in certain circumstances although we and caesars believe the consummation of the merger will not likely be prevented by antitrust laws there can be no assurance that a challenge to the merger on antitrust grounds will not be made or if a challenge is made what the result will be under the merger agreement we and caesars have agreed to use our reasonable best efforts to obtain all regulatory clearances necessary to consummate the merger at the earliest practicable date

in addition in order to consummate the merger we and caesars may be required to comply with conditions terms obligations or restrictions imposed by antitrust gaming and other regulatory entities including divestitures and such conditions terms obligations or restrictions may have the effect of delaying consummation of the merger imposing additional material costs on or materially limiting the revenue of the combined company after the consummation of the merger or otherwise reducing the anticipated benefits to us of the merger such conditions terms obligations or restrictions may result in the delay or abandonment of the merger

gaming regulatory approvals may not be received may take longer than expected or may impose conditions that are not presently anticipated or cannot be met

consummation of the merger is conditioned on the receipt of approvals from a number of gaming regulatory authorities including among others the ak chin community tribal gaming commission the arizona department of gaming the cherokee tribal gaming commission the colorado division of gaming the illinois gaming board the indiana gaming commission the indiana horse racing commission the iowa racing and gaming commission the kentucky horse racing commission the louisiana gaming control board the louisiana state racing commission the maryland lottery and gaming control agency the mississippi gaming commission the missouri gaming commission the national indian gaming commission the nevada gaming commission the new jersey casino control commission the new jersey division of gaming enforcement the pennsylvania gaming control board the pennsylvania state horse racing

there can be no assurance that we will be able to secure the financing in connection with the merger including without limitation the proceeds from the transactions with vici contemplated by the mta and the transactions contemplated by the ar commitment letter on acceptable terms in a timely manner or at all

we intend to finance at least a portion of the cash required in connection with the merger including expenses in connection with the merger with the debt financing in accordance with the ar commitment letter the ar commitment letter provides for funding to i us of a a 10000 million senior secured revolving credit facility b a 30000 million senior secured term loan b facility c a 32500 million senior secured 364day bridge facility and d a 18000 million senior unsecured bridge loan facility and ii caesars resort collection llc a subsidiary of caesars of a 24000 million senior secured incremental term loan b facility collectively the “debt financing” the senior secured 364day bridge facility will only be funded in accordance with the ar commitment letter to the extent that the net cash proceeds of certain asset sales and certain transactions contemplated with vici as described in the next succeeding paragraph are not available on the closing date of the merger to be applied to finance the merger and expenses in connection therewith in addition to the debt financing we also entered into letter agreements with certain financial institutions which additional letter agreements provide i for commitments from such financial institutions to provide additional revolving credit facility commitments for us and ii the engagement of such financial institutions to act as arrangers for additional debt financing in each case in the event we elect to refinance certain existing indebtedness of caesars resort collection llc and its subsidiaries and for working capital and general corporate purposes upon the consummation of the merger additionally we may continue to evaluate alternative financing structures and amounts based on our needs and capital markets conditions the proceeds of the debt financing may be used a to pay all or a portion of the cash portion of the merger consideration b to refinance all of our existing syndicated bank credit facilities and outstanding senior notes c to refinance certain of caesars’ and its subsidiaries’ existing debt d to pay transaction fees and expenses related to the merger and related transactions andor e for working capital and general corporate purposes the availability of the borrowings under the debt financing is subject to the satisfaction of certain customary conditions including the substantially concurrent consummation of the merger in the event some or all of the financing contemplated by the ar commitment letter is not available we are obligated to use our reasonable best efforts to obtain alternative financing from alternative institutions in an amount at least equal to the amount of such unavailable portion of the financing contemplated by the ar commitment letter and in an amount sufficient to enable us to consummate the merger 

in connection with the execution of the merger agreement and the initial commitment letter we entered into the mta with vici we intend to finance at least a portion of the cash required in connection with the merger with the proceeds of transactions that are subject to the mta including approximately 18 billion of proceeds from the expected sale leaseback of certain properties expected to be acquired upon consummation of the merger including harrah’s new orleans harrah’s laughlin and harrah’s atlantic city or under certain circumstances if necessary certain replacement properties specified in the mta and approximately 14 billion of proceeds expected to be received in consideration of the amendment of certain existing leases between subsidiaries of caesars and vici pursuant to the mta we have agreed among other things and subject to the consummation of the merger and the other applicable conditions set forth therein and in any related documents to i through one or more of our subsidiaries after giving effect to the merger to consummate one or more sale and leaseback transactions with vici andor its affiliates with respect to certain property described in the mta including harrah’s new orleans harrah’s laughlin and harrah’s atlantic city ii through one or more of our subsidiaries after giving effect to the merger to amend the cplv lease the noncplv lease and the joliet lease each as defined in the mta in accordance with the terms of the mta and receive certain consideration from vici or its affiliates in respect thereof iii to provide a guaranty in respect of each of the cplv lease the noncplv lease and the joliet lease in accordance with the terms of the mta iv to enter into or cause our subsidiaries after giving effect to the merger to enter

the consummation of the merger is not conditioned on our ability to obtain financing or the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the mta if we are unable to obtain funding contemplated by the ar commitment letter from our financing sources for the cash required in connection with the merger we may be compelled to specifically perform our obligations to consummate the merger or could otherwise be subject to claims under the merger agreement each of which could have a material adverse effect on the company

 

litigation challenging the merger could delay or prevent the consummation of the merger

one of the conditions to the merger is that no law statute rule regulation ordinance code ruling subpoena order writ injunction decree judgment ruling determination directive award or settlement issued by a governmental entity including any gaming authority shall have been adopted promulgated or issued that would prohibit restrain enjoin or render unlawful the consummation of the merger or the share issuance eight complaints have been filed challenging the merger seven of the complaints generally assert claims under sections 14a and 20a of the exchange act challenging the adequacy of certain disclosures made in the version of this joint proxy statementprospectus filed with the sec on september 3 2019 those complaints seek among other relief an injunction preventing consummation of the merger damages in the event that the merger is consummated and attorneys’ fees the eighth complaint filed in nevada state court asserts claims for breach of fiduciary duty by among other things approving the merger at an unfair price and disseminating materially misleading information in connection with the merger the parties to the litigation have an agreement in principle to settle the claims however there can be no assurances that the claims will be settled on the expected terms or at all there can be no assurance that additional claims will not be filed by our stockholders or stockholders of caesars seeking damages relating to or otherwise challenging the merger if the plaintiffs in any such action secure injunctive or other relief prohibiting delaying or otherwise adversely affecting ours and caesars’ ability to consummate the merger then such injunctive or other relief may prevent the merger from becoming effective within the expected time frame or at all if consummation of the merger is prevented or delayed it could result in substantial costs to us in addition whether or not any plaintiff’s claim is successful we could incur significant costs in connection with any such litigation including costs associated with the indemnification of ours and caesars’ directors and officers and the attention and resources of the respective management of ours and caesars could be diverted from the consummation of the merger and ongoing business activities which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

the merger agreement contains provisions that limit our ability to pursue alternatives to the merger could discourage a potential competing acquiror of ours from making a favorable alternative transaction proposal and in specified circumstances could require us to pay caesars a termination fee

the merger agreement contains certain provisions that restrict our ability to solicit initiate knowingly facilitate or knowingly encourage any inquiries regarding or the making of any proposal or offer that constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a competing proposal engage continue or otherwise participate in any substantive discussions or negotiations regarding or furnish any nonpublic information to any person in connection with or for the purpose of encouraging or facilitating a competing proposal

these provisions could discourage a potential thirdparty acquiror or merger partner that might have an interest in acquiring all or a significant portion of the company or pursuing an alternative transaction with the company from considering or proposing such a transaction

 

 

if the merger is not consummated the price of our common stock and our future businesses and operations could be harmed 

if the merger is not consummated we will not have realized any of the potential benefits of the merger having been consummated and may be subject to material risks including



















the integration of the company and caesars following the merger may present significant challenges we cannot be sure that we will be able to realize the anticipated benefits of the merger in the anticipated time frame or at all

our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the merger will depend to a large extent on our ability to integrate caesars’ businesses into the company in the anticipated time frame or at all we may face significant challenges in combining caesars’ operations into our operations in a timely and efficient manner the combination of two independent businesses is a complex costly and timeconsuming process as a result we will be required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating the business practices and operations of caesars into those of the company the integration process may disrupt the businesses and if implemented ineffectively or inefficiently would preclude realization of the full benefits expected by us and caesars the failure to successfully integrate caesars into the company and to manage the challenges presented by the integration process successfully may result in an interruption of or loss of momentum in the business of the company which may have the effect of depressing the market price of our common stock following the merger

we may be unable to realize anticipated synergies or may incur additional costs

we expect to realize cost synergies and savings from the elimination of overlapping functions of caesars and the company reduction of third party professional services and consulting expenses and other targeted efficiencies we further anticipate to benefit from revenue synergies however we will be required to incur costs including severance and related expenses to realize the anticipated synergies in addition the amount of synergies realized after consummation of the merger may be reduced from anticipated levels as a result of cost reduction programs that have been implemented or may be implemented by caesars prior to consummation of the merger including caesars’ previously announced cost saving initiatives which caesars expects to result in annualized cost savings of at least 75 million while our management believes the combined company will benefit from synergies we may be unable to realize all of these synergies within the time frame expected or at all in addition we may incur additional or unexpected costs in order to realize these synergies

 

 

unanticipated costs relating to the merger could reduce our future earnings per share 

we believe that we have reasonably estimated the likely incremental costs of the combined operations of the company and caesars following the merger however it is possible that unexpected transaction costs such as taxes fees or professional expenses or unexpected future operating expenses such as unanticipated costs to integrate the two businesses or increased personnel costs as well as other types of unanticipated adverse developments could have an adverse effect on the business financial condition and results of operations of the combined company following the merger in addition if actual costs are materially different than expected costs the merger could have a significant dilutive effect on our earnings

we will have a substantial amount of debt outstanding following the merger and may incur additional indebtedness in the future which could restrict our ability to pay dividends and fund working capital and planned capital expenditures

we expect to enter into the debt financing in order to consummate the merger and refinance our existing syndicated bank credit facilities and senior notes and a portion of caesars’ and its subsidiaries’ outstanding indebtedness will remain outstanding following the consummation of the merger as a result we will have a significant amount of additional indebtedness outstanding following the consummation of the merger in addition we expect to have the ability to incur additional debt under our anticipated 10 billion revolving credit facility and caesars resorts collection llc’s existing 10 billion revolving credit facility we also continually evaluate alternative financing structures and amounts based on our needs and capital markets conditions we may be required to incur indebtedness under the 364day secured bridge facility provided under the debt financing or other additional indebtedness to finance the merger consideration if the transactions contemplated by the mta or the previously announced sales of certain of our properties are not consummated prior to or in connection with the consummation of the merger this amount of leverage could have important consequences including













future interest expense will be significantly higher than historic interest expense as a result of higher levels of indebtedness incurred to consummate the merger our ability to make payments on our debt and potential to pay dividends on our common stock which we have not historically done will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future which will depend on many factors beyond our control we cannot assure you that







if we cannot generate sufficient cash from our operations to meet our debt service obligations we may need to reduce or delay capital expenditures the development of our business generally and any acquisitions if we become unable to meet our debt service and repayment obligations or those of our subsidiaries following the merger we or our applicable subsidiaries would be in default under the terms of the applicable credit agreement or indenture which would allow our lenders or noteholders to declare all outstanding indebtedness thereunder to be due and payable and terminate any commitments to lend thereunder if the amounts outstanding under our or our subsidiaries’ credit facilities or indentures were to be accelerated we cannot assure you that our or our subsidiaries’ assets would be sufficient to repay in full the money owed

 

following consummation of the merger and the transactions contemplated by the mta we and our subsidiaries will be required to pay a significant portion of our cash flow from operations to third parties pursuant to leasing and related arrangements 

the company and caesars currently lease certain parcels of land on which several of their respective properties are located and pursuant to the terms of mta are expected to enter into leases with vici with respect to parcels of land on which harrah’s new orleans harrah’s laughlin and harrah’s atlantic city are located and will increase the lease rate on an existing lease agreement between a subsidiary of caesars and vici which will require our subsidiaries that are parties to such leases to apply a significant amount of their cash flow to required rental payments these leases also are expected to require certain levels of capital expenditures to be made on the properties leased under these leases on an ongoing basis as a result of the obligation to pay rent and make capital expenditures under the new and existing leases the ability of the combined company to fund its operations or development projects raise capital make acquisitions and otherwise respond to competitive and economic changes may be adversely affected for example the obligations under these lease agreements may











in addition the annual rent escalations under these lease agreements will continue to apply regardless of the amount of cash flows generated by the properties that are subject to these lease agreements accordingly if the cash flows generated by such properties decrease or do not increase at the same rate as the rent escalations the rents payable under these lease agreements could comprise a higher percentage of the cash flows generated by the applicable entity which could exacerbate perhaps materially the issues described above any of the above listed factors could have an adverse effect on the combined company’s business financial condition and results of operations

moreover if the combined company were to default on any one or more of these lease agreements the applicable lessors could terminate the affected leases and we could lose possession of the land leased under the affected leases and any improvements on that land including the hotels and casinos a termination of these lease agreements could result in a default under the company’s or its subsidiaries’ applicable credit agreements which would allow its lenders to declare all outstanding borrowings to be due and payable and terminate any commitments thereunder and could have a material adverse effect on the combined company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

the guaranties to be entered into by us in connection with the existing and new leases with vici will include covenants that may restrict our ability to pay dividends and repurchase our shares following the merger

we will guaranty the obligations of our subsidiaries under the existing and new leases with vici pursuant to which our subsidiaries will lease certain parcels of land on which several of their respective properties are located these guaranties will include covenants which among other things may restrict our ability to pay dividends or repurchase our shares if our market capitalization is less than 55 billion and may restrict our ability to make noncash dividends in each case following the merger

 

delay or failure to consummate the sale of our properties previously announced by us may require us to incur additional debt to pay the cash portion of the merger consideration or to repay our outstanding indebtedness or otherwise adversely impact the business financial condition and results of operations of the combined company following the merger 

on july 10 2019 we entered into an agreement to sell isle of capri casino kansas city and lady luck casino vicksburg for aggregate consideration of 2300 million subject to certain adjustments the consummation of the transaction is subject to satisfaction of customary conditions including receipt of required regulatory approvals the accuracy of the parties’ representations and warranties compliance with covenants delivery of certain closing deliverables and the absence of any governmental order or action seeking to prohibit the consummation of the transaction although we expect such sale transaction to be consummated prior to consummation of the merger there can be no assurance as to the timing of the closing of such sales or that the closings will occur on the terms set forth in the purchase agreements relating to the sales or at all in the event that the closing of either sale is delayed or does not occur we may be required to incur the 364day secured bridge facility under the debt financing or other additional indebtedness to pay the cash portion of the merger consideration to repay our and certain of caesars’ and its subsidiaries’ outstanding debt andor to pay transaction fees and expenses related thereto which could adversely impact the business financial condition and results of operations of the combined company following the merger

on september 26 2019 eri and vici entered into the real estate purchase agreements for the sale of harrah’s new orleans harrah’s laughlin and harrah’s atlantic city for aggregate consideration of approximately 18 billion subject to satisfaction of customary conditions including receipt of required regulatory approvals in the event that the closing of any of the sales is delayed or does not occur within a certain timeframe we may be required to incur the 364day secured bridge facility under the debt financing or other additional indebtedness to pay the cash portion of the merger consideration to repay our and certain of caesars’ and its subsidiaries outstanding debt andor to pay transaction fees and expenses related thereto which could adversely impact the business financial condition and results of operations of the combined company following the merger 

 

on january 13 2020 we entered into a definitive agreement to sell eldorado resort casino shreveport for cash consideration of approximately 230 million subject to certain adjustments the consummation of the transaction is subject to receipt of required regulatory approvals the prior or concurrent closing of the merger and other customary conditions  

a substantial amount of caesars’ net operating loss carryforwards may be used as a result of transactions relating to the merger and eri’s ability to use any remaining net operating loss carryforwards may become limited as a result of the merger  

as of december 31 2018 caesars reported approximately 26 billion of net operating loss “nol” carryforwards for us federal income tax purposes certain transactions relating to the merger will give rise to taxable income for caesars and depending on the tax treatment of certain of those transactions such taxable income may be substantial while we expect that any such taxable income would be offset by the nol carryforwards if taxable income is greater than expected the associated reduction in caesars’ nol carryforwards may result in the us federal income taxes payable by the combined company following the merger being greater than expected additionally under section 382 of the code if a corporation undergoes an “ownership change” the corporation’s ability to use its prechange nols and certain other tax attributes to offset its postchange income may be limited in the event the merger causes an ownership change with respect to caesars on the effective date of the merger section 382 of the code would apply to limit eri’s use of any nols remaining after the effective date of the merger in addition if there is an ownership change of caesars as a result of the merger and recently proposed regulations are applicable to that ownership change  the combined company’s ability to utilize caesars’ nols may be more severely limited than would be the case under existing rules   if certain updates to the proposed regulations apply it is not expected that the proposed regulations would be applicable to the merger 

 

risks related to our capital structure and equity ownership 

our obligations under our indebtedness and master lease are significant

as of december 31 2019 we had 26 billion of total indebtedness outstanding consisting of 4988 million outstanding under our term loan facility the “term loan facility” or “term loan” 600 million in aggregate principal amount of outstanding 60 senior notes due 2026 the “6 senior notes due 2026” 8750 million in aggregate principal amount of outstanding 60 senior notes due 2025 the “6 senior notes due 2025” 3750 million in aggregate principal amount of outstanding 70 senior notes due 2023 the “7 senior notes due 2023” and 2460 million of principal outstanding under our loan to fund the 246 million purchase of the real estate underlying lumière “lumière loan” as of december 31 2019 we had no outstanding balance under our 5000 million revolving credit facility the “revolving credit facility” and together with the term loan the “credit facility” in addition our annual rent payment under the master lease is at least 889 million and is subject to annual escalation these financial obligations may have important negative consequences for us including

























in addition the master lease requires us to make specific minimum investments in capital expenditures and subject to certain caps the rent escalations under the master lease will continue to apply regardless of the cash flows generated by the properties subject to the master lease and the obligations under the master lease are guaranteed by eri if the cash flows generated by the leased properties decrease or do not increase at the same rate as the rent escalations the rent payable under the master lease and required capital expenditures could constitute a higher percentage of cash flows generated by the leased properties which could materially exacerbate the consequences described above

 

our debt obligations will substantially increase following the merger and we may incur additional indebtedness in the future which could restrict our ability to pay dividends and fund working capital and planned capital expenditures 

we expect to enter into the debt financing in order to consummate the merger and refinance our existing syndicated bank credit facilities and senior notes and a portion of caesars’ and its subsidiaries’ outstanding indebtedness will remain outstanding following the consummation of the merger as a result we will have a significant amount of additional indebtedness outstanding following the consummation of the merger in addition we expect to have the ability to incur additional debt under its anticipated 10 billion revolving credit facility and caesars resorts collection llc’s existing 10 billion revolving credit facility we also continually evaluate alternative financing structures and amounts based on our needs and capital markets conditions we may be required to incur indebtedness under the 364day secured bridge facility provided under the debt financing or other additional indebtedness to finance the merger consideration if the transactions contemplated by the mta or the previously announced sales of certain of our properties are not consummated prior to or in connection with the consummation of the merger this amount of leverage could have important consequences including













future interest expense will be significantly higher than historic interest expense as a result of higher levels of indebtedness incurred to consummate the merger our ability to make payments on our debt and potential to pay dividends on our common stock which we have not historically done will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future which will depend on many factors beyond our control we cannot assure you that







if we cannot generate sufficient cash from our operations to meet our debt service obligations we may need to reduce or delay capital expenditures the development of our business generally and any acquisitions if we become unable to meet our debt service and repayment obligations or those of our subsidiaries following the merger we or our applicable subsidiaries would be in default under the terms of the applicable credit agreement or indenture which would allow our lenders or noteholders to declare all outstanding indebtedness thereunder to be due and payable and terminate any commitments to lend thereunder if the amounts outstanding under our or our subsidiaries’ credit facilities or indentures were to be accelerated we cannot assure you that our or our subsidiaries’ assets would be sufficient to repay in full the money owed

despite our current indebtedness levels we and our subsidiaries may still incur significant additional indebtedness incurring more indebtedness could increase the risks associated with our substantial indebtedness 

we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness including additional secured indebtedness and may enter into financing obligations similar to the master lease in the future as of december 31 2019 we had 4820 million of borrowing capacity after consideration of 180 million in outstanding letters of credit under our credit facility our existing debt agreements currently permit and we expect that agreements governing debt that we incur in the future will permit us to incur certain other additional secured and unsecured debt further we may incur other liabilities that do not constitute indebtedness the risks that we face based on our outstanding indebtedness may intensify if we incur additional indebtedness or financing obligations in the future

 

the libor calculation method may change and libor is expected to be phased out after 2021 

our credit facility calculates interest on the outstanding principal balance using libor on july 27 2017 the united kingdom financial conduct authority the “fca” announced it would phase out libor as a benchmark by the end of 2021 in the meantime actions by the fca other regulators or law enforcement agencies may result in changes to the method by which libor is calculated at this time it is not possible to predict the effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows of any such changes or any other reforms to libor that may be enacted in the united kingdom or elsewhere

we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and pay rent under the master lease and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness which may not be successful

our ability to satisfy our rent obligations under the master lease and make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial business legislative regulatory and other factors beyond our control we cannot assure you that we will maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay rent under the master lease and the principal premium if any and interest on our indebtedness

if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service and rent obligations we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to sell assets seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness these alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service and rent obligations if our operating results and available cash are insufficient to meet our debt service and rent obligations we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations we may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain the proceeds that we could realize from them and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due additionally the agreements governing our existing debt restrict sales of assets and limit the use of the proceeds from any disposition and our master lease limits our ability to dispose of leased properties as a result we may not be allowed under these documents to dispose of certain of our properties and use proceeds from such dispositions to satisfy all current debt service obligations

the agreements governing our debt and the master lease impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries which may prevent us from capitalizing on business opportunities

the agreements governing our existing debt impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us these restrictions limit our ability among other things to

















in addition the credit agreement governing the credit facility contains certain financial covenants including minimum interest coverage ratio and maximum total leverage ratio covenants

a failure to comply with the covenants contained in the agreements governing our existing or future indebtedness could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could result in the acceleration of the indebtedness and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations if our indebtedness were to be accelerated there can be no assurance that our assets would be sufficient to repay such indebtedness in full moreover in the event that such indebtedness is accelerated there can be no assurance that we will be able to refinance it on acceptable terms or at all

 

in addition our master lease imposes restrictions on the business activities of the tenant including restrictions on transfers of leased properties requirements to make minimum specified levels of capital expenditures and limitations on the operation of the leased properties the master lease also restricts payments of dividends if the tenant does not meet the specified minimum adjusted revenue to rent ratio 

as a result of these covenants and restrictions we are limited in how we conduct our business and we may be unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities the restrictions caused by such covenants could also place us at a competitive disadvantage to our competitors

the market price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly

the us securities markets in general have experienced significant price fluctuations in recent years the market price of our common stock may be volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in addition the trading volume of our common stock may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur some of the factors that could cause fluctuations in or have a material adverse effect on the stock price or trading volume of our common stock include

























we cannot assure you that the stock price of our common stock will not fluctuate or decline significantly in the future in addition the stock market in general can experience considerable price and volume fluctuations that may be unrelated to our performance if the market price of our common stock fluctuates significantly we may become the subject of securities class action litigation which may result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources

we have not historically paid dividends and may not pay dividends in the future

we do not currently expect to pay dividends on our common stock any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon among other factors our earnings cash requirements financial condition requirements to comply with the covenants under our debt instruments legal considerations and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant in addition the agreements governing our indebtedness restrict its ability to pay dividends if we do not pay dividends then the return on an investment in our common stock will depend entirely upon any future appreciation in our stock price there is no guarantee that our common stock will appreciate in value or maintain its value

accounting for business combinations required our management to make significant estimates and assumptions including our estimate of the fair value of intangible assets such as gaming licenses trade names and loyalty programs although we believe the assumptions and estimates made have been reasonable and appropriate they are inherently uncertain for our gaming license valuation our properties’ estimated future cash flows were the primary assumption in the respective intangible valuations cash flow estimates included assumptions regarding factors such as recent and budgeted operating performance net win per unit revenue patron visits and growth percentages the growth percentages were developed considering general macroeconomic conditions as well as competitive impacts from current and anticipated competition through a review of customer market data operating margins and current regulatory social and economic climates the most significant of the assumptions used in the valuations included 1 revenue growthdecline percentages 2 discount rates 3 effective income tax rates 4 future terminal values and 5 capital expenditure assumptions these assumptions were developed for each of our properties based on historical trends in the current competitive markets in which they operate and projections of future performance and competition the primary assumptions with respect to our trade names and loyalty program intangibles were the appropriate royalty rates and cost estimates for replacement cost analyses respectively

income taxes

we and our subsidiaries file us federal income tax returns and various state and local income tax returns our income tax returns are subject to examination by the internal revenue service “irs” and other tax authorities positions taken in tax returns are sometimes subject to uncertainty in the tax laws and may not ultimately be accepted by the irs or other tax authorities see note 13 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the status and impact of examinations by tax authorities 

we record income taxes under the asset and liability method whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and as attributable to operating loss and tax credit carryforwards we reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if based on the available evidence it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized accordingly the need to establish valuation allowances for deferred tax assets is assessed periodically based on the “more likely than not” realization threshold this assessment considers among other matters the nature frequency and severity of current and cumulative losses forecasts of future profitability the duration of statutory carryforward periods our experience with operating loss and tax credit carryforwards not expiring unused and tax planning alternatives

a valuation allowance is recognized if based on the weight of available evidence it is morelikelythannot that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized management analyzes all available positive and negative evidence regarding realization of the deferred tax assets and make an assessment of the likelihood of sufficient future taxable income 

 

under the applicable accounting standards we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more‑likely‑than‑not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement the accounting standards also provide guidance on de‑recognition classification interest and penalties on income taxes accounting in interim periods and disclosure requirements for uncertain tax positions we have recorded no liability associated with uncertain tax positions at december 31 2019 and 2018

 

property and equipment and other long‑lived assets

property and equipment are recorded at cost except for assets acquired in our business combinations which were adjusted for fair value under asc 805 and are depreciated over their remaining estimated useful life or lease term judgments are made in determining estimated useful lives and salvage values of these assets the accuracy of these estimates affects the amount of depreciation expense recognized in our financial results and whether we have a gain or loss on the disposal of assets we review depreciation estimates and methods as new events occur more experience is acquired and additional information is obtained that would possibly change our current estimates

 

property equipment and other long ‑lived assets are assessed for impairment in accordance with asc 360 property plant and equipment we evaluate our long ‑lived assets for impairment issues whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable recoverability of these assets is determined by comparing the net carrying value to the sum of the estimated future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by these assets the amount of impairment loss if any is measured by the difference between the net carrying value and the estimated fair value of the asset which is typically measured using a discounted cash flow model level 3 of the fair value hierarchy for assets to be disposed of impairment is recognized based on the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs of disposal as estimated based on comparable asset sales offers rece ived or a discounted cash flow model as a result of the agreement to sell nemacolin an impairment charge of 38 million for the year ended december 31 2018 was recorded to property and equipment due to the carrying value of net property and equipment being sold exceeding net sales proceeds based on the results of our periodic reviews we have not recorded any longlived assets impairment charges during the years ended december 31 201 9 and 201 7  

for undeveloped properties including non‑operating real properties when indicators of impairment are present properties are evaluated for impairment and losses are recorded when undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by an asset or market comparisons are less than the asset’s carrying amount the amount of the impairment loss is calculated as the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its fair value which is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis management estimates or market comparisons the fair value measurements employed for our impairment evaluations which are subject to the assumptions and factors as previously discussed were generally based on a review of comparable activities in the marketplace which fall within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy as a result of the sale of certain nonoperating real property located in pennsylvania we recognized an impairment charge of 10 million during the year ended december 31 2019 

goodwill and other indefinite‑lived intangible assets

goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over fair market value of net assets acquired in business combinations intangible assets acquired in business combinations are recorded based upon their fair value at the date of acquisition goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets must be reviewed for impairment at least annually and between annual test dates in certain circumstances we utilize the option to perform a step zero analysis for each of our reporting units and if we conclude it was more likely than not that the fair values of certain reporting units are less than their carrying values then we utilize the twostep quantitative analysis for such reporting units as a result of our annual impairment tests none of our reporting units incurred any goodwill impairment charges in 2019 and 2018 for our 2017 annual impairment tests we concluded it was more likely than not that the fair values of certain reporting units were less than their carrying values and as a result of the twostep quantitative analysis performed in 2017 we recorded impairment charges of 349 million and 31 million related to goodwill and trade names respectively in conjunction with the classification of vicksburg’s operations as assets held for sale at march 31 2018 an impairment charge totaling 98 million to goodwill was recorded

our indefinite‑lived intangible assets consist of racing and gaming licenses and trade names and are evaluated for impairment annually by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying value any excess of carrying value over the fair value is recognized as an impairment within the consolidated statements of income in the period of review

the gaming and racing licenses were valued in aggregate for each respective property as these licenses are considered to be the most significant asset of the properties and the gaming licenses could not be obtained without holding the racing licenses therefore a market participant would consider the licenses in aggregate the fair value of the licenses is calculated using an excess earnings methodology which is an income approach methodology that allocates the projected cash flows of the property to the gaming license intangible assets less charges for the use of the other identifiable assets of the property including working capital fixed assets and other intangible assets we believe this methodology is appropriate as the gaming licenses are the primary asset to the properties the licenses are linked to each respective facility and it’s the lowest level at which discrete cash flows can be directly attributable to the assets under the gaming legislation applicable to our properties licenses are property specific and can only be acquired if a buyer acquires the existing facility because existing licenses may not be acquired and transferred for use at a different facility the estimated future cash flows of each of our properties was the primary assumption in the valuation of such property

we value trade names using the relief‑from‑royalty method with royalty rates range from 05 ‑ 10 trade names recorded as part of the merger with mtr are amortized on a straight‑line basis over a 35year useful life and the trade names recorded as part of our acquisition of tropicana elgin isle and acquisition of the reno properties are not amortized deemed indefinitelived 

 

the loyalty programs were valued using a combination of a replacement cost and lost profits analysis and the loyalty programs are amortized on a straight ‑line basis over a one to fiveyear useful life 

assessing goodwill and indefinite‑lived intangible assets for impairment is a process that requires significant judgment and involves detailed qualitative and quantitative business‑specific analysis and many individual assumptions which fluctuate between assessments our properties’ estimated future cash flows are a primary assumption in the respective impairment analyses unforeseen events changes in circumstances and market conditions and material differences in estimates of future cash flows could negatively affect the fair value of our assets and result in an impairment charge which could be material cash flow estimates include assumptions regarding factors such as recent and budgeted operating performance net win per unit revenue patron visits growth percentages which are developed considering general macroeconomic conditions as well as competitive impacts from current and anticipated competition through a review of customer market data operating margins and current regulatory social and economic climates these estimates could also be negatively impacted by changes in federal state or local regulations economic downturns or developments and other market conditions affecting travel and access to the properties the most significant of the assumptions used in our valuations include 1 revenue growthdecline percentages 2 discount rates 3 effective income tax rates 4 future terminal values and 5 capital expenditure assumptions these assumptions were developed for each property based on historical trends the current competitive markets in which they operate and projections of future performance and competition

we believe we have used reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the fair value of our goodwill reporting units and other indefinite‑lived intangible assets however these estimates and assumptions could be materially different from actual results if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected or if events occur or circumstances change that would reduce the fair value of our licensing intangibles below the carrying value reflected on the consolidated balance sheet we may be required to conduct an interim test or possibly recognize impairment charges which may be material in future periods

self‑insurance reserves

we are self‑insured for various levels of general liability employee medical insurance coverage and workers’ compensation coverage insurance claims and reserves include accruals of estimated settlements for known claims as well as accruals of estimates for claims incurred but not yet reported we utilize independent consultants to assist management in its determination of estimated insurance liabilities while the total cost of claims incurred depends on future developments in managements’ opinion recorded reserves are adequate to cover future claims payments selfinsurance reserves for employee medical claims and workers’ compensations are included in accrued payroll and related on the consolidated balance sheets self‑insurance reserves for general liability claims are included in accrued other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets

player loyalty programs

we offer programs at our properties whereby participating customers can accumulate points for wagering that can be redeemed for credits for free play on slot machines lodging food and beverage merchandise and in limited situations cash the incentives earned by customers under these programs are based on previous revenue transactions and represent separate performance obligations points earned less estimated breakage are recorded as a reduction of casino revenues at the standalone selling price of the points when earned based upon the retail value of the benefits historical redemption rates and estimated breakage and recognized as departmental revenue based on where such points are redeemed upon fulfillment of the performance obligation the loyalty program liability represents a deferral of revenue until redemption occurs which is typically less than one year

litigation claims and assessments

we utilize estimates for litigation claims and assessments these estimates are based on our knowledge and experience regarding current and past events as well as assumptions about future events if our assessment of such a matter should change we may have to change the estimates which may have an adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows actual results could differ from these estimates

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices such as interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily from variable rate long‑term debt arrangements 

as of december 31 2019 our variable‑rate long‑term borrowings totaled 4988 million under the term loan no amounts were outstanding under the revolving credit facility variable‑rate borrowings under the term loan and the revolving credit facility represented approximately 19 of our long‑term debt as of december 31 2019 declining from 36 as of december 31 2018 during the year ended december 31 2019 the weighted average interest rates on our variable and fixed rate debt were 40 and 65 respectively

 

libor is expected to be discontinued after 2021 the interest rate per annum applicable to loans under our credit facility is at our option either libor plus a margin or a base rate plus a margin the credit facility permits the administrative agent to select in its reasonable discretion an alternative base rate in the event that libor is discontinued but there can be no assurances as to what alternative base rates may be and whether such base rate will be more or less favorable than libor and any other unforeseen impacts of the potential discontinuation of libor we intend to continue monitoring the developments with respect to the potential phasing out of libor after 2021 and work with our lenders to ensure any transition away from libor will have minimal impact on our financial condition but can provide no assurances regarding the impact of the discontinuation of libor

the company evaluates its exposure to market risk by monitoring interest rates in the marketplace and has on occasion utilized derivative financial instruments to help manage this risk the company does not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading purposes there were no material quantitative changes in our market risk exposure or how such risks are managed for the year ended december 31 2019

the following table provides information as of december 31 2019 about our debt obligations including debt that is sensitive to changes in interest rates and presents principal payments and related weightedaverage interest rates by expected maturity dates implied forward rates should not be considered a predictor of actual future interest rates

the scheduled maturities of our longterm debt outstanding for the years ending december 31 are as follows

 



 



 

as of december 31 2019 borrowings outstanding under our term loan were variablerate borrowings assuming a 100 basispoint increase in libor in the case of the term loan over the 1 floor specified in our credit agreement our annual interest cost would change by 50 million based on gross amounts outstanding at december 31 2019

risk factors

risk factors relating to our operations

our business is sensitive to reductions in discretionary consumer spending as a result of downturns in the economy and other factors outside our control

consumer demand for casino hotel and racetrack properties such as ours is particularly sensitive to downturns in the economy and the associated impact on discretionary spending on leisure activities changes in discretionary consumer spending or consumer preferences brought about by factors such as perceived or actual general economic conditions effects of declines in consumer confidence in the economy the impact of high energy and food costs the increased cost of travel the potential for continued bank failures decreased disposable consumer income and wealth or fears of war and future acts of terrorism could further reduce customer demand for the amenities that we offer in addition increases in gasoline prices including increases prompted by global political and economic instabilities can adversely affect our operations because most of our patrons travel to our properties by car or on airlines that may pass on increases in fuel costs to passengers in the form of higher ticket prices further security concerns terrorist attacks and other geopolitical events can have a material adverse effect on leisure and business travel discretionary spending and other areas of economic behavior that directly impact the gaming and entertainment industries in general and our business in particular economic downturns geopolitical events and other related factors which impact discretionary consumer spending and other economic events that are beyond our control have had direct effects on our business and the tourism industry in the past and could adversely affect us in the future

 

we face substantial competition in the hotel and casino industry and expect that such competition will continue 

the gaming industry is characterized by an increasingly high degree of competition and competition is intense in most of the markets in which we operate we compete with a variety of gaming operations including landbased casinos dockside casinos riverboat casinos casinos located on racing tracks and casinos located on native american reservations and other forms of legalized gaming such as video gaming terminals vgts at bars restaurants and truck stops we also compete to a lesser extent with other forms of legalized gaming and entertainment such as online gambling bingo pull tab games card parlors sports books fantasy sports websites “cruisetonowhere” operations parimutuel or telephonic betting on horse racing and dog racing statesponsored lotteries jaialai and in the future may compete with gaming at other venues in addition we compete more generally with other forms of entertainment for the discretionary spending of our customers certain of our competitors are large gaming companies with greater name recognition and marketing and financial resources in some instances particularly in the case of native american casinos our competitors pay lower taxes or no taxes these factors create additional challenges for us in competing for customers and accessing cash flow or financing to fund improvements for our casino and entertainment product that enable us to remain competitive 

in addition states that already have legalized casino gaming may further expand gaming and other states that have not yet legalized gaming may do so in the future legalized casino gaming in these states and on native american reservations in or near our markets or changes to gaming laws in states in which we have operations and in states near our operations could increase competition and could adversely affect our operations there has been significant competition in our markets as a result of the expansion of facilities by existing market participants the entrance of new gaming participants into a market or legislative changes in prior years and expanded gaming is under consideration in certain of our markets for example gaming facilities in ohio that commenced operations in recent years present significant competition for mountaineer presque isle downs nemacolin and scioto downs in addition the governor of pennsylvania signed legislation in october 2017 expanding gaming to allow for up to ten additional casino locations video gaming terminals vgts at truck stops interactive gaming igaming gaming at airports and potentially sports wagering in missouri there are two proposals pending before the missouri general assembly for the expansion of gaming in the state the missouri sports betting bill would allow class b gaming licensees and daily fantasy sports licensees to conduct sports wagering including on mobile devices so long as such devices are located within the state of missouri the missouri video lottery terminal bill would allow the state lottery to operate video gaming terminals similar to slot machines at various locations distributed across the state including bars restaurants veterans and fraternal organizations and convenience stores throughout the state each of these bills are in the early stages of the law making process and subject to significant changes in proposed statutory language prior to enactment any such expansion of legalized gaming could adversely impact our properties 

casino gaming is currently prohibited in several jurisdictions from which the shreveportbossier city and lake charles markets draw customers primarily texas the texas legislature has from time to time considered proposals to legalize gaming and there can be no assurance that casino gaming will not be approved in texas in the future which could have a material adverse effect on eldorado shreveport and lake charles additionally since visitors from california comprise a significant portion of our customer base in reno we also compete with native american gaming operations in california native american tribes are allowed to operate slot machines lottery games and banking and percentage games on native american lands a number of native american tribes have established largescale gaming facilities in california additionally from time to time the state of florida has entered into or amended gaming compacts with native american casinos or enacted amended or discussed possible changes in gaming laws which could have positive or negative impacts on our pompano operations in addition various forms of internet gaming have been approved in nevada new jersey delaware and pennsylvania and legislation permitting internet gaming has been proposed by the federal government and other states the expansion of internet gaming in nevada and other jurisdictions could result in significant additional competition

increased competition may require us to make substantial capital expenditures to maintain and enhance the competitive positions of our properties to increase the attractiveness and add to the appeal of our facilities because a significant portion of our cash flow is required to pay obligations under our outstanding indebtedness and the master lease there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient funds to undertake these expenditures or that we will be able to obtain sufficient financing to fund such expenditures if we are unable to make such expenditures our competitive position could be negatively affected

 

our operations in certain jurisdictions depend on agreements with third parties 

our operations in several jurisdictions depend on agreements with third parties if we are unable to renew these agreements on satisfactory terms as they expire our business may be disrupted and in the event of disruptions in multiple jurisdictions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations for example iowa law requires that each gambling venue in iowa must have a licensed “qualified sponsoring organization” or qso which is a taxexempt nonprofit organization the qso must donate the profits it receives from casino operations to educational civic public charitable patriotic or religious uses both of our iowa properties have an agreement with a local qso we have the right to renew our agreements for bettendorf and waterloo when they expire in 2025 and 2021 respectively 

the federal interstate horse racing act and the state racing laws in certain jurisdictions where we have racetracks require that in order to simulcast races we have written agreements with the horse owners and trainers at those racetracks or that we share proceeds of slot machines at the applicable racetrack if we fail to maintain operative agreements with the horsemen at our racetracks we will not be permitted to conduct live racing and export and import simulcasting and may not be permitted to continue our gaming operations at the applicable racetrack at those facilities which could have material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

some of our casinos are located on leased property if we default on one or more leases the applicable lessors could terminate the affected leases and we could lose possession of the affected casino 

we currently lease certain parcels of land on which several of our properties are located including five of the properties that we acquired in the tropicana acquisition as a ground lessee we have the right to use the leased land however we do not hold fee ownership of the underlying land accordingly we have no interest in the leased land or improvements thereon at the expiration of the ground leases moreover since we do not completely control the land underlying the property a landowner could take certain actions to disrupt our rights in the land leased under the longterm leases which are beyond our control if the entity owning any leased land chose to disrupt our use either permanently or for a significant period of time then the value of our assets could be impaired and our business and operations could be adversely affected our leases provide that they may be terminated for a number of reasons including failure to pay rent taxes or other payment obligations or the breach of other covenants contained in the leases in particular the master lease requires initial annual rent payments of at least 876 million which is subject to escalation annually and obligates us to make specified minimum capital expenditures with respect to the leased properties if our business and properties fail to generate sufficient earnings the payments required to service the rent obligations under the master lease could materially and adversely limit our ability to react to changes in our business and make acquisitions and investments in our properties if we were to default on any one or more of these leases the applicable lessors could terminate the affected leases and we could lose possession of the affected land and any improvements on the land including the hotels and casinos a termination of our ground leases or the master lease could result in a default under our debt agreements and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations further in the event that any lessor of our leased properties including properties that are subject to the master lease encounters financial operational regulatory or other challenges there can be no assurance that such lessor will be able to comply with its obligations under the applicable lease

certain of our leases including the master lease are “triplenet” leases accordingly in addition to rent we are required to pay among other things the following 1 lease payments to the underlying ground lessor for properties that are subject to ground leases 2 facility maintenance costs 3 all insurance premiums for insurance with respect to the leased properties and the business conducted on the leased properties 4 taxes levied on or with respect to the leased properties other than taxes on the income of the lessor and 5 all utilities and other services necessary or appropriate for the leased properties and the business conducted on the leased properties we are responsible for incurring the costs described in the preceding sentence notwithstanding the fact that many of the benefits received in exchange for such costs shall in part accrue to the lessor as the owner of the associated facilities in addition we remain obligated for lease payments and other obligations under the master lease and other ground leases even if one or more of such leased facilities is unprofitable or if we decide to withdraw from those locations we could incur special charges relating to the closing of such facilities including lease termination costs impairment charges and other special charges that would reduce our net income and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

 

we are subject to extensive federal state and local regulation and licensing and gaming authorities have significant control over our operations which could have an adverse effect on our business 

licensing requirements  the ownership and operation of casino gaming riverboat and horse racing facilities are subject to extensive federal state and local regulation and regulatory authorities at the federal state and local levels have broad powers with respect to the licensing of gaming businesses and may revoke suspend condition or limit our gaming or other licenses impose substantial fines and take other actions each of which poses a significant risk to our business financial condition and results of operations we currently hold all state and local licenses and related approvals necessary to conduct our present gaming operations but we must periodically apply to renew many of our licenses and registrations we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such renewals any failure to maintain or renew our existing licenses registrations permits or approvals would have a material adverse effect on us furthermore if additional laws or regulations are adopted or existing laws or regulations are amended or interpreted differently these regulations could impose additional restrictions or costs that could have a significant adverse effect on us 

gaming authorities with jurisdiction over our operations may in their discretion require the holder of any securities issued by us to file applications be investigated and be found suitable to own our securities if they have reason to believe that the security ownership would be inconsistent with the declared policies of their respective jurisdictions further the costs of any investigation conducted by any of the gaming authorities under these circumstances must be paid by the applicant and refusal or failure to pay these charges may constitute grounds for a finding that the applicant is unsuitable to own the securities if any of the gaming authorities determines that a person is unsuitable to own our securities then under the applicable gaming or horse racing laws and regulations we can be sanctioned including the loss of approvals that are required for us to continue our gaming operations in the relevant jurisdictions if such unsuitable person does not timely sell our securities

our officers directors and key employees are also subject to a variety of regulatory requirements and various licensing and related approval procedures in the various jurisdictions in which we operate gaming facilities if any of the applicable gaming authorities were to find an officer director or key employee of ours unsuitable for licensing or unsuitable to continue having a relationship with us we would have to sever all relationships with that person furthermore the gaming authorities may require us to terminate the employment of any person who refuses to file appropriate applications either result could materially adversely affect our gaming operations

applicable gaming laws and regulations restrict our ability to issue securities incur debt and undertake other financing activities such transactions would generally require approval of applicable gaming authorities and our financing counterparties including lenders might be subject to various licensing and related approval procedures in the various jurisdictions in which we operate gaming facilities if state regulatory authorities were to find any person unsuitable with regard to his her or its relationship to us or any of our subsidiaries we would be required to sever our relationships with that person which could materially adversely affect our business

compliance with other laws  we are also subject to a variety of other federal state and local laws rules regulations and ordinances that apply to nongaming businesses including zoning environmental construction and landuse laws and regulations governing smoking and the serving of alcoholic beverages legislation in various forms to ban indoor tobacco smoking has been enacted or introduced in many states and local jurisdictions including several of the jurisdictions in which we operate if additional restrictions on smoking are enacted in our jurisdictions we could experience a significant decrease in gaming revenue and particularly if such restrictions are not applicable to all competitive facilities in that gaming market our business could be materially adversely affected under various federal state and local laws and regulations an owner or operator of real property may be held liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances or wastes located on its property regardless of whether or not the present owner or operator knows of or is responsible for the presence of such substances or wastes we have not identified any issues associated with our properties that could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on us or the results of our operations however several of our properties are located in industrial areas or were used for industrial purposes for many years as a consequence it is possible that historical or neighboring activities have affected one or more of our properties and that as a result environmental issues could arise in the future the precise nature of which we cannot now predict the coverage and attendant compliance costs associated with these laws regulations and ordinances may result in future additional costs 

 

regulations adopted by fincen require us to report currency transactions in excess of 10000 occurring within a gaming day including identification of the patron by name and social security number us treasury department regulations also require us to report certain suspicious activity including any transaction that exceeds 5000 if we know suspect or have reason to believe that the transaction involves funds from illegal activity or is designed to evade federal regulations or reporting requirements substantial penalties can be imposed if we fail to comply with these regulations fincen has recently increased its focus on gaming companies 

we are required to report certain customer’s gambling winnings via form w2g to comply with current internal revenue service regulations should these regulations change we would expect to incur additional costs to comply with the revised reporting requirements

taxation and fees  in addition gaming companies are generally subject to significant revenuebased taxes and fees in addition to normal federal state and local income taxes and such taxes and fees are subject to increase at any time we pay substantial taxes and fees with respect to our operations from time to time federal state and local legislators and officials have proposed changes in tax laws or in the administration of such laws affecting the gaming industry in addition worsening economic conditions could intensify the efforts of state and local governments to raise revenues through increases in gaming taxes andor property taxes it is not possible to determine with certainty the likelihood of changes in tax laws or in the administration of such laws such changes if adopted could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations the large number of state and local governments with significant current or projected budget deficits makes it more likely that those governments that currently permit gaming will seek to fund such deficits with new or increased gaming taxes andor property taxes and worsening economic conditions could intensify those efforts any material increase or the adoption of additional taxes or fees could have a material adverse effect on our future financial results 

income taxes we are subject to tax in multiple us tax jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes deferred tax assets or liabilities and in evaluating our tax positions while we believe our tax positions are consistent with the tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business it is possible that these positions may be overturned by jurisdictional tax authorities which may have a significant impact on our provision for income taxes 

tax laws are dynamic and subject to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of the law are issued or applied the us recently enacted significant tax reform and certain provisions of the new law may adversely affect us in addition governmental tax authorities are increasingly scrutinizing the tax positions of companies if us or state tax authorities change applicable tax laws our overall taxes could increase and our business financial condition or results of operations may be adversely impacted

we have partnership agreements to expand our sportsbook business and engage in online sportsbook casino gaming and poker there can be no assurance that regulations authorizing such activities will be approved in the jurisdictions in which we operate or that the market for such gaming activities will develop as expected

during the second quarter of 2018 the us supreme court overturned the federal ban on sports betting as a result several jurisdictions in which we operate legalized sports betting and additional jurisdictions may do so in the future we currently accept wagers on sporting events in nevada new jersey and west virginia and anticipate accepting wagers on sporting events during the first quarter of 2019 at our casinos located in pennsylvania and mississippi however our ability to expand our sports betting and online operations is dependent on adoption of regulations permitting sports betting in the united states and may be negatively impacted by a recent opinion of the us justice department’s office of legal counsel relating to the restrictions on online gaming under existing federal statutes there can be no assurances when or if regulations enabling sports betting and online sportsbook casino gaming and poker will be adopted or the terms of such regulations in certain of the jurisdictions in which we operate 

 

following the repeal of the federal ban on sports betting we entered into a definitive agreement with william hill pursuant to which william hill has agreed to operate as our sports betting operator including with respect to mobile and online sports wagering for a period of 25 years we also entered into a 20year agreement with tsg pursuant to which we agreed to provide tsg with options to obtain access to certain of our licenses for online sports wagering and real money online gaming and poker we received equity interests in william hill us william hill plc and tsg in consideration for the execution of these agreements and we may in the future receive additional consideration including revenue sharing based on the betting and gaming operations conducted under the authority of our licenses or in our markets to the extent permitted under our agreements with william hill and tsg we will continue to evaluate options for additional partnerships to operate online betting and gaming activities under the authority of our licenses and may in the future enter into additional partnership agreements with respect to such operations 

the market for sports betting and online gaming is rapidly evolving and highly competitive with an increasing number of competitors the success of our sportsbook and online betting and gaming partners the value of our equity interests in william hill and tsg and the results of operations from sports betting and online sportsbook and gaming conducted at our properties or under the authority of our licenses are dependent on a number of factors that are beyond our control including















there can be no assurance as to the returns that we will receive from our current and anticipated sports betting and online gaming operations or our partnerships with william hill and tsg or future similar arrangements with other market service providers

we rely on our key personnel and we may face difficulties in attracting and retaining qualified employees for our casinos and race tracks

our future success will depend upon among other things our ability to keep our senior executives and highly qualified employees we compete with other potential employers for employees and we may not succeed in hiring or retaining the executives and other employees that we need a sudden loss of or inability to replace key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operation

in addition the operation of our business requires qualified executives managers and skilled employees with gaming and horse racing industry experience and qualifications who are able to obtain the requisite licenses and approval from the applicable gaming authorities there has from time to time been a shortage of skilled labor in our markets in addition to limitations that may otherwise exist in the supply of skilled labor the continued expansion of gaming near our facilities including the expansion of native american gaming may make it more difficult for us to attract qualified individuals while we believe that we will continue to be able to attract and retain qualified employees shortages of skilled labor will make it increasingly difficult and expensive to attract and retain the services of a satisfactory number of qualified employees and we may incur higher costs than expected as a result

work stoppages organizing drives and other labor problems could negatively impact our future profits

as of december 31 2018 we had 21 collective bargaining agreements covering approximately 3400 employees a lengthy strike or other work stoppages at any of our casino properties could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations given the large number of employees labor unions are making a concerted effort to recruit more employees in the gaming industry including at some of our properties as a result we cannot provide any assurance that we will not experience additional and more successful union organization activity in the future

 

because we own real property we will be subject to extensive environmental regulation which creates uncertainty regarding future environmental expenditures and liabilities 

we are subject to various federal state and local environmental health and safety laws and regulations that govern activities that may have adverse environmental effects such as discharges to air and water as well as the use storage discharge emission and disposal of solid animal and hazardous wastes and exposure to hazardous materials these laws and regulations are complex and frequently subject to change in addition our horse racing facilities are subject to laws and regulations that address the impacts of manure and wastewater generated by concentrated animal feeding operations “cafo” on water quality including but not limited to storm water discharges cafo regulations include permit requirements and water quality discharge standards enforcement of cafo regulations has been receiving increased governmental attention compliance with these and other environmental laws can in some circumstances require significant capital expenditures we have from time to time been responsible for investigating and remediating or contributing to remediation costs related to contamination located at or near certain of our facilities including contamination related to underground storage tanks and groundwater contamination arising from prior uses of land on which certain of our facilities are located in addition we have been and may in the future be required to manage abate remove or contain manure and wastewater generated by concentrated animal feeding operations due to our racetrack operations mold lead asbestos‑containing materials or other hazardous conditions found in or on our properties moreover violations can result in significant fines or penalties and in some instances interruption or cessation of operations

we are also subject to laws and regulations that create liability and cleanup responsibility for releases of regulated materials into the environment certain of these laws and regulations impose strict and under certain circumstances joint and several liability on a current or previous owner or operator of property for the costs of remediating regulated materials on or emanating from its property the costs of investigation remediation or removal of those substances may be substantial

an earthquake hurricane flood other natural disaster act of terrorism or other casualty events could adversely affect our business and we may not have sufficient insurance coverage to cover such losses

the operations of our facilities are subject to disruption or reduced patronage as a result of severe weather conditions natural disasters and other casualty events including acts of terrorism or violence the reno area has been and may in the future be subject to earthquakes and other natural disasters and certain of our other properties are located in flood zones or are otherwise subject to significant disruption based on adverse weather conditions because many of our gaming operations are located on or adjacent to bodies of water these facilities are subject to risks in addition to those associated with other casinos including loss of service due to casualty forces of nature mechanical failure extended or extraordinary maintenance flood hurricane or other severe weather conditions and other disasters for example flooding along the mississippi river can impact eight or more of our properties and result in them being closed for differing periods of time our properties in florida mississippi louisiana and new jersey are particularly vulnerable to hurricanes wind and storm surge our pompano property was closed for four days in 2017 because of storms in addition severe weather such as high winds and blizzards occasionally limits access to our landbased facilities in colorado and reno inadequate insurance or lack of available insurance for these and other certain types or levels of risk could expose us to significant losses in the event that a catastrophe occurred for which we are underinsured further if properties subject to the master lease are impacted by a casualty event the master lease requires us to repair or restore the affected properties even if the cost of such repair or restoration exceeds the insurance proceeds that we receive under such circumstances the rent under the master lease is required to be paid during the period of repair or restoration even if all or a portion of the affected property is not operating in addition to the damage caused to our properties by a casualty loss we may suffer business disruption as a result of the casualty event or be subject to claims by third parties that may be injured or harmed while we carry general liability insurance and business interruption insurance there can be no assurance that insurance will be available or adequate to cover all loss and damage to which our business or our assets might be subjected in addition certain casualty events such as labor strikes nuclear events loss of income due to terrorism violence deterioration or corrosion insect or animal damage and pollution may not be covered under our policies any losses we incur that are not adequately covered by insurance may decrease our future operating income require us to fund replacements or repairs for destroyed property and reduce the funds available for payments of our obligations further we renew our insurance policies on an annual basis the cost of coverage may become so high that we may need to further reduce our policy limits or agree to certain exclusions from coverage among other factors it is possible that regional political tensions homeland security concerns other catastrophic events or any change in government legislation governing insurance coverage for acts of terrorism could materially adversely affect available insurance coverage and result in increased premiums on available coverage which may cause us to elect to reduce our policy limits additional exclusions from coverage or higher deductibles among other potential future adverse changes in the future we may elect to not or may not be able to obtain any coverage for losses due to acts of terrorism

 

we are subject to risks relating to mechanical failure forces of nature casualty extraordinary maintenance and other causes 

all of our facilities will generally be subject to the risk that operations could be halted for a temporary or extended period of time as the result of casualty forces of nature mechanical failure or extended or extraordinary maintenance among other causes in addition our gaming operations could be damaged or halted due to extreme weather conditions these risks are particularly pronounced at our riverboat and dockside facilities because of their locations on and adjacent to water

our reliance on our computer systems and software could expose us to great financial harm if any of our computer systems or software were subject to any material disruption or corruption

 

we rely significantly on our computer systems and software to receive and properly process internal and external data including data related to our player loyalty program a disruption or corruption of the proper functioning of our computer systems or software could cause us to lose data or record erroneous data which could result in material losses we cannot guarantee that our efforts to maintain competitive computer systems and software will be successful our computer systems and software may fail or be subject to bugs or other errors resulting in service interruptions or other unintended consequences if any of these risks materialize they could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

 

we are or may become involved in legal proceedings that if adversely adjudicated or settled could impact our business and financial condition

from time to time we are named in lawsuits or other legal proceedings relating to our respective businesses in particular the nature of our business subjects us to the risk of lawsuits filed by customers past and present employees competitors business partners and others in the ordinary course of business as with all legal proceedings no assurances can be given as to the outcome of these matters moreover legal proceedings can be expensive and time consuming and we may not be successful in defending or prosecuting these lawsuits which could result in settlements or damages that could significantly impact our business financial condition and results of operations

our information technology and other systems are subject to cyber security risk including misappropriation of customer information or other breaches of information security

we collect information relating to our guests and employees for various business purposes including marketing and promotional purposes the collection and use of personal data are governed by privacy laws and regulations enacted in the united states we rely on information technology and other systems to maintain and transmit this personal and financial information credit card settlements credit card funds transmissions mailing lists and reservations information our information and processes are subject to the everchanging threat of compromised security in the form of a risk of potential breach system failure computer virus or unauthorized or fraudulent use by customers company employees or employees of thirdparty vendors we face cybersecurity threats which may range from uncoordinated individual attempts to sophisticated and targeted measures directed at us cyberattacks and security breaches may include but are not limited to attempts to access information including customer and company information computer malware such as viruses denial of service ransomware attacks that encrypt exfiltrate or otherwise render data unusable or unavailable in an effort to extort money or other consideration as a condition to purportedly returning the data to a usable form operator errors or misuse or inadvertent releases of data and other forms of electronic security breaches the steps we take to deter and mitigate these risks may not be successful and any resulting compromise or loss of data or systems could adversely impact operations or regulatory compliance and could result in remedial expenses fines litigation and loss of reputation potentially impacting our financial results

in addition third party service providers and other business partners process and maintain proprietary business information and data related to our guests suppliers and other business partners our information technology and other systems that maintain and transmit this information or those of service providers or business partners may also be compromised by a malicious thirdparty penetration of our network security or that of a third party service provider or business partner or impacted by intentional or unintentional actions or inactions by our employees or those of a third party service provider or business partner as a result our business information guest supplier and other business partner data may be lost disclosed accessed or taken without their consent

 

any such loss  disclosure or misappropriation of or access to guests’ or business partners’ information or other breach of our information security can result in legal claims or legal proceedings including regulatory investigations and actions may have a serious impact on our reputation and may adversely affect our businesses operating results and financial condition furthermore the loss disclosure or misappropriation of our business information may adversely affect our reputation businesses operating results and financial condition  

our operations have historically been subject to seasonal variations and quarterly fluctuations in operating results and we can expect to experience such variations and fluctuations in the future

historically our operations have typically been subject to seasonal variations our strongest operating results for our reno properties have generally occurred in the second and third quarters and the weakest results have generally occurred during the period from november through february when weather conditions adversely affected operating results winter conditions can frequently adversely affect transportation routes to reno where a significant of our visitors arrive by ground transportation and certain of our other properties and cause cancellations of live horse racing for example the renotahoe area experienced exceptionally high levels of snowfall in the first quarter of 2017 with certain resorts in the tahoe area reporting over 50 feet of snowfall during such time which adversely affected visitation to our reno properties and adversely affected our results of operations for the first quarter of 2017 as a result unfavorable seasonal conditions could have a material adverse effect on our operations

the concentration and evolution of the slot machine manufacturing industry could impose additional costs on us

there are a limited number of slot machine manufacturers servicing the gaming industry and a large majority of our revenues are derived from slot machines at our casinos it is important for competitive reasons that we offer the most popular and uptodate slot machine games with the latest technology to customers 

in recent years slot machine manufacturers have frequently refused to sell slot machines featuring the most popular games instead requiring participating lease arrangements generally a participating lease is substantially more expensive over the longterm than the cost to purchase a new slot machine 

for competitive reasons we may be forced to acquire new slot machines slot machine systems or gaming and hotel technology and equipment or enter into participating lease arrangements that are more expensive than our costs associated with the continued operation of our existing slot machines equipment and software if the newer slot machines equipment or software do not result in sufficient incremental revenues to offset the increased investment or if we are unable to successfully implement new software or technology it could adversely affect our operations and profitability 

we face risks associated with growth and acquisitions

as part of our business strategy we regularly evaluate opportunities for growth through development of gaming operations in existing or new markets through acquiring other gaming entertainment facilities or through redeveloping our existing gaming facilities in the future we may also pursue expansion opportunities including joint ventures in jurisdictions where casino gaming is not currently permitted in order to be prepared to develop projects upon approval of casino gaming 

although we only intend to engage in acquisitions that if consummated will be accretive to us and our stockholders we cannot be sure that we will be able to identify attractive acquisition opportunities or that we will experience the return on investment that we expect in particular while we currently anticipate that the acquisitions of tropicana and elgin will be accretive to our earnings per share in 2019 this expectation is based on estimates and assumes certain synergies expected to be realized over a 12month period following the completion of the acquisitions such estimates and assumptions could materially change due to factors beyond our control and could delay decrease or eliminate the expected accretive effect of the acquisitions and cause resulting dilution to our earnings per share or negatively impact the price of our common stock

in addition acquisitions require significant management attention and resources to integrate new properties businesses and operations potential difficulties we may encounter as part of the integration process include 





 



in addition it is possible that the integration process could result in 







any of which could adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with customers suppliers employees and other constituencies or our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits or could reduce our earnings or otherwise adversely affect our business and financial results 

there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify acquire develop or profitably manage additional companies or operations or successfully integrate such companies or operations into our existing operations without substantial costs delays or other problems additionally there can be no assurance that we will receive gaming or other necessary licenses or approvals for new projects that we may pursue or that gaming will be approved in jurisdictions where it is not currently approved

we may experience construction delays or cost overruns during our expansion or development projects that could adversely affect our operations

from time to time we may commence development and construction projects on new properties or at our current properties we also evaluate other expansion opportunities as they become available and may in the future engage in additional construction projects as an example we recently formed a joint venture with cordish to master plan and develop a mixeduse entertainment and hospitality destination expected to be located on unused land adjacent to the pompano casino and racetrack the anticipated costs and construction periods for development and construction projects are based upon budgets conceptual design documents and construction schedule estimates prepared by us or in the case of pompano our joint venture partner in consultation with our architects all of which are subject to assumptions that may be subject to change based on unforeseen circumstances development and construction projects entail significant risks which can substantially increase costs or delay completion of a project such risks include shortages of materials or skilled labor unforeseen engineering environmental or geological problems work stoppages weather interference and unanticipated cost increases most of these factors are beyond our control in addition difficulties or delays in obtaining any of the requisite entitlements licenses permits or authorizations from regulatory authorities can increase the cost or delay the completion of an expansion or development significant budget overruns or delays with respect to expansion and development projects could adversely affect our results of operations

our planned capital expenditures may not result in our expected improvements in our business

we regularly expend capital to construct maintain and renovate our properties to remain competitive maintain the value and brand standards of our properties and comply with applicable laws and regulations our ability to realize the expected returns on our capital investments is dependent on a number of factors including general economic conditions changes to construction plans and specifications delays in obtaining or inability to obtain necessary permits licenses and approvals disputes with contractors disruptions to our business caused by construction and other unanticipated circumstances or cost increases

while we believe that the overall budgets for our planned capital expenditures are reasonable these costs are estimates and the actual costs may be higher than expected in addition we can provide no assurance that these investments will be sufficient or that we will realize our expected returns on our capital investments or any returns at all a failure to realize our expected returns on capital investments could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations

 

we may incur impairments to goodwill indefinitelived intangible assets or longlived assets which could negatively affect our operating results 

as of december 31 2018 we had 24 billion of goodwill and other intangible assets we perform annual impairment testing for goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets as of october 1 of each fiscal year or on an interim basis if indicators of impairment exist for properties with goodwill andor other intangible assets with indefinite lives these tests could require the comparison of the implied fair value of each reporting unit to carrying value in conjunction with the classification of vicksburg’s operations as assets held for sale at march 31 2018 as a result of the announced sale to churchill downs incorporated an impairment charge totaling 98 million was recorded due to the carrying value exceeding the estimated net sales proceeds the impairment reduced the value of goodwill additionally in conjunction with the agreement to sell our rights and obligations to operate nemacolin an impairment charge totaling 38 million was recorded in 2018 due to the carrying value of the property and equipment being sold exceeding the estimated net sales proceeds

during the fourth quarter of 2017 we recorded an impairment charge totaling 380 million to reduce the carrying value of goodwill andor trade names related to our lake charles lula and vicksburg reporting units

we must make various assumptions and estimates in performing our impairment testing our qualitative assessments including assumptions regarding market and industry conditions and our financial performance our quantitative assessment relies on estimates of future cash flows that are based on reasonable and supportable assumptions which represent our best estimates of the cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets including their eventual disposition and by a market approach based upon valuation multiples for similar companies changes in estimates or market conditions increases in our cost of capital reductions in transaction multiples operating and capital expenditure assumptions or application of alternative assumptions and definitions could produce significantly different results

we also evaluate longlived assets for impairment if indicators of impairment exist in assessing the recoverability of the carrying value of such property equipment and other longlived assets we make assumptions regarding future cash flows and residual values

future cash flow estimates are by their nature subjective and actual results may differ materially from our estimates if our ongoing estimates of future cash flows are not met we may have to record additional impairment charges in future accounting periods our estimates of cash flows are based on the current regulatory social and economic climates recent operating information and budgets and current operating plans of the various properties where we conduct operations these estimates could be negatively impacted by changes in federal state or local regulations economic downturns internal operating decisions or other events affecting various forms of travel and access to our properties

risks related to our capital structure and equity ownership

our obligations under our indebtedness and master lease are significant

as of december 31 2018 we had 33 billion of total indebtedness outstanding consisting of 9568 million outstanding under our term loan facility the “term loan facility” or “term loan” 600 million in aggregate principal amount of outstanding 60 senior notes due 2026 the “6 senior notes due 2026” 8750 million in aggregate principal amount of outstanding 60 senior notes due 2025 the “6 senior notes due 2025” 3750 million in aggregate principal amount of outstanding 70 senior notes due 2023 the “7 senior notes due 2023” and 2460 million of principal outstanding under our loan to fund the purchase of elgin “lumière loan” as of december 31 2018 we had 2450 outstanding under our 5000 million revolving credit facility the “revolving credit facility” and together with the term loan the “credit facility” in addition our annual rent payment under the master lease is at least 876 million and is subject to annual escalation these financial obligations may have important negative consequences for us including











 















in addition the master lease requires us to make specific minimum investments in capital expenditures and subject to certain caps the rent escalations under the master lease will continue to apply regardless of the cash flows generated by the properties subject to the master lease and the obligations under the master lease are guaranteed by eri if the cash flows generated by the leased properties decrease or do not increase at the same rate as the rent escalations the rent payable under the master lease and required capital expenditures could constitute a higher percentage of cash flows generated by the leased properties which could materially exacerbate the consequences described above

despite our current indebtedness levels we and our subsidiaries may still incur significant additional indebtedness incurring more indebtedness could increase the risks associated with our substantial indebtedness 

we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness including additional secured indebtedness and may enter into financing obligations similar to the master lease in the future as of december 31 2018 we had 2423 million of borrowing capacity after consideration of 127 million in outstanding letters of credit under our credit facility our existing debt agreements currently permit and we expect that agreements governing debt that we incur in the future will permit us to incur certain other additional secured and unsecured debt further we may incur other liabilities that do not constitute indebtedness the risks that we face based on our outstanding indebtedness may intensify if we incur additional indebtedness or financing obligations in the future

we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and pay rent under the master lease and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness which may not be successful

our ability to satisfy our rent obligations under the master lease and make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial business legislative regulatory and other factors beyond our control we cannot assure you that we will maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay rent under the master lease and the principal premium if any and interest on our indebtedness

if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service and rent obligations we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to sell assets seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness these alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service and rent obligations if our operating results and available cash are insufficient to meet our debt service and rent obligations we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations we may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain the proceeds that we could realize from them and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due additionally the agreements governing our existing debt restrict sales of assets and limit the use of the proceeds from any disposition and our master lease limits our ability to dispose of leased properties as a result we may not be allowed under these documents to dispose of certain of our properties and use proceeds from such dispositions to satisfy all current debt service obligations

 

the agreements governing our debt and the master lease impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries which may prevent us from capitalizing on business opportunities 

the agreements governing our existing debt impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us these restrictions limit our ability among other things to

















in addition the credit agreement governing the credit facility contains certain financial covenants including minimum interest coverage ratio and maximum total leverage ratio covenants

a failure to comply with the covenants contained in the agreements governing our existing or future indebtedness could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could result in the acceleration of the indebtedness and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations if our indebtedness were to be accelerated there can be no assurance that our assets would be sufficient to repay such indebtedness in full moreover in the event that such indebtedness is accelerated there can be no assurance that we will be able to refinance it on acceptable terms or at all

in addition our master lease imposes restrictions on the business activities of the tenant including restrictions on transfers of leased properties requirements to make minimum specified levels of capital expenditures and limitations on the operation of the leased properties the master lease also restricts payments of dividends if the tenant does not meet the specified minimum adjusted revenue to rent ratio 

as a result of these covenants and restrictions we are limited in how we conduct our business and we may be unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities the restrictions caused by such covenants could also place us at a competitive disadvantage to our competitors

the market price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly

the us securities markets in general have experienced significant price fluctuations in recent years the market price of our common stock may be volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in addition the trading volume of our common stock may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur some of the factors that could cause fluctuations in or have a material adverse effect on the stock price or trading volume of our common stock include



















 







we cannot assure you that the stock price of our common stock will not fluctuate or decline significantly in the future in addition the stock market in general can experience considerable price and volume fluctuations that may be unrelated to our performance if the market price of our common stock fluctuates significantly we may become the subject of securities class action litigation which may result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources

we have not historically paid dividends and may not pay dividends in the future

we do not currently expect to pay dividends on its common stock any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon among other factors our earnings cash requirements financial condition requirements to comply with the covenants under its debt instruments legal considerations and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant in addition the agreements governing our indebtedness restrict its ability to pay dividends if we do not pay dividends then the return on an investment in its common stock will depend entirely upon any future appreciation in its stock price there is no guarantee that our common stock will appreciate in value or maintain its value

liquidity and capital resources

we are a holding company and our only significant assets are ownership interests in our subsidiaries our ability to fund our obligations depends on the cash flow of our subsidiaries and the ability of our subsidiaries to distribute or otherwise make funds available to us 

our primary sources of liquidity and capital resources have been existing cash cash flow from operations borrowings under our revolving credit facility proceeds from the issuance of debt securities and proceeds from our recent disposition of presque isle

our cash requirements can fluctuate significantly depending on our decisions with respect to business acquisitions or dispositions and strategic capital investments to maintain the quality of our properties we expect that our primary capital requirements going forward will relate to the operation and maintenance of our properties taxes servicing our outstanding indebtedness rent payments under our master lease and continued costs associated with the recent elgin and tropicana acquisitions during 2019 we plan to spend approximately 2000 million on capital expenditures including capital expenditures for the properties purchased in the elgin and tropicana acquisitions our capital requirements have increased significantly following the consummation of the acquisitions of tropicana and elgin the related obligation to pay annual rent in an initial amount of approximately 876 million under the master lease with respect to certain of the tropicana properties and the required payments under the lumière note

at december 31 2018 we had consolidated cash and cash equivalents of 2308 million excluding restricted cash at december 31 2017 we had consolidated cash and cash equivalents of 1346 million excluding restricted cash this increase in cash was primarily due to cash acquired in the elgin and tropicana acquisitions 

operating cash flow in 2018 cash flows provided by operating activities totaled 3233 million compared to 1299 million in 2017 the increase in operating cash was primarily due to incremental operating cash generated by the acquired elgin and tropicana properties and decreased transaction costs combined with changes in the balance sheet accounts in the normal course of business 

in 2017 cash flows provided by operating activities totaled 1299 million compared to 954 million in 2016 the increase in operating cash was primarily due to incremental operating cash generated by the acquired isle properties offset by transaction expenses associated with our acquisition of isle combined with changes in the balance sheet accounts in the normal course of business

net cash used for financing activities in 2017 totaled 14 billion and consisted mainly of the issuance of debt associated with our acquisition of isle the refinancing of our term loan and revolving credit facility in may 2017 and the issuance of additional 60 senior notes due 2025 in september 2017 this increase was partially offset by net payments made on our credit facilities throughout 2017 and taxes paid related to net share settlements of equity awards associated with the isle transaction

income taxes  the company will pay approximately 45 million in cash taxes in 2019 as a result of the tropicana acquisition in addition the company expects to be a cash taxpayer in 2019 due to the complete utilization of its net operating losses and tax credit carryovers for federal income tax purposes

critical accounting policies

our significant accounting policies are included in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements which are included elsewhere in this report these policies along with the underlying assumptions and judgments made by our management in 

 

their application have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty and actual results could differ from our estimates 

business combinations 

we applied the provisions of accounting standards codification “asc” topic 805 “business combinations” in the accounting for our acquisitions of isle elgin tropicana and our previous acquisitions it required us to recognize the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair values goodwill as of their respective acquisition dates were measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed

accounting for business combinations required our management to make significant estimates and assumptions including our estimate of intangible assets such as gaming licenses trade names and loyalty programs although we believe the assumptions and estimates made have been reasonable and appropriate they are inherently uncertain for our gaming license valuation our properties estimated future cash flows were the primary assumption in the respective intangible valuations cash flow estimates included assumptions regarding factors such as recent and budgeted operating performance net win per unit revenue patron visits and growth percentages the growth percentages were developed considering general macroeconomic conditions as well as competitive impacts from current and anticipated competition through a review of customer market data operating margins and current regulatory social and economic climates the most significant of the assumptions used in the valuations included 1 revenue growthdecline percentages 2 discount rates 3 effective income tax rates 4 future terminal values and 5 capital expenditure assumptions these assumptions were developed for each of our properties based on historical trends in the current competitive markets in which they operate and projections of future performance and competition the primary assumptions with respect to our trade names and loyalty program intangibles primary assumptions were selecting the appropriate royalty rates and cost estimates for replacement cost analyses respectively

casino revenue and parimutuel commissions

the company recognizes net win from gaming activities as casino revenue which is the difference between gaming wins and losses not the total amount wagered progressive jackpots are accrued and charged to revenue at the time the obligation to pay the jackpot is established gaming revenues are recognized net of certain cash and free play incentives parimutuel commissions consist of commissions earned from thoroughbred and harness racing and importing of simulcast signals from other race tracks and are recognized at the time wagers are made such commissions are a designated portion of the wagering handle as determined by state racing commissions and are shown net of the taxes assessed by state and local agencies as well as purses and other contractual amounts paid to horsemen associations the company recognizes revenues from fees earned through the exporting of simulcast signals to other race tracks at the time wagers are made and recorded on a gross basis such fees are based upon a predetermined percentage of handle as contracted with the other race tracks

nongaming revenue

hotel food and beverage and other operating revenues are recognized as services are performed the revenue for hotel food and beverage contracts is the net amount collected from the customer for such goods and services hotel food and beverage services have been determined to be separate standalone performance obligations and the transaction price for such contracts is recorded as revenue as the good or service is transferred to the customer over the customer’s stay at the hotel or when the delivery is made for the food and beverage advance deposits for future hotel occupancy convention space or food and beverage services contracts are recorded as deferred income until the revenue recognition criteria has been met the company also provides goods and services that may include multiple performance obligations such as for packages for which revenues are allocated on a pro rata basis based on each services standalone selling price

complimentaries

the company offers discretionary coupons and other discretionary complimentaries to customers outside of the loyalty program the retail value of complimentary food beverage hotel rooms and other services provided to customers is recognized as a reduction to the revenues for the department which issued the complimentary and a credit to the revenue for the department redeemed complimentaries provided by third parties at the discretion and under the control of the company is recorded as an expense when incurred

for information with respect to our adoption of asu no 201409 “revenue from contracts with customers” topic 606 effective january 1 2018 see “ note 2 summary of significant accounting policies – recently issued accounting pronouncements ” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements

 

income taxes 

we and our subsidiaries file us federal income tax returns and various state and local income tax returns our income tax returns are subject to examination by the internal revenue service “irs” and other tax authorities positions taken in tax returns are sometimes subject to uncertainty in the tax laws and may not ultimately be accepted by the irs or other tax authorities see note 12 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the status and impact of examinations by tax authorities 

we record income taxes under the asset and liability method whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and as attributable to operating loss and tax credit carryforwards we reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if based on the available evidence it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized accordingly the need to establish valuation allowances for deferred tax assets is assessed periodically based on the “more likely than not” realization threshold this assessment considers among other matters the nature frequency and severity of current and cumulative losses forecasts of future profitability the duration of statutory carryforward periods our experience with operating loss and tax credit carryforwards not expiring unused and tax planning alternatives

a valuation allowance is recognized if based on the weight of available evidence it is morelikelythannot that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized management must analyze all available positive and negative evidence regarding realization of the deferred tax assets and make an assessment of the likelihood of sufficient future taxable income 

 

under the applicable accounting standards we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more‑likely‑than‑not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement the accounting standards also provide guidance on de‑recognition classification interest and penalties on income taxes accounting in interim periods and disclosure requirements for uncertain tax positions we have recorded no liability associated with uncertain tax positions at december 31 2018 and 2017

 

property and equipment and other long‑lived assets

property and equipment are recorded at cost except for assets acquired in our business combinations which were adjusted for fair value under asc 805 and are depreciated over their remaining estimated useful life or lease term judgments are made in determining estimated useful lives and salvage values of these assets the accuracy of these estimates affects the amount of depreciation expense recognized in our financial results and whether we have a gain or loss on the disposal of assets we review depreciation estimates and methods as new events occur more experience is acquired and additional information is obtained that would possibly change our current estimates

property equipment and other long‑lived assets are assessed for impairment in accordance with asc 360 property plant and equipment we evaluate our long‑lived assets periodically for impairment issues or more frequently whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable recoverability of these assets is determined by comparing the net carrying value to the sum of the estimated future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by these assets the amount of impairment loss if any is measured by the difference between the net carrying value and the estimated fair value of the asset which is typically measured using a discounted cash flow model level 3 of the fair value hierarchy for assets to be disposed of impairment is recognized based on the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs of disposal as estimated based on comparable asset sales offers received or a discounted cash flow model as a result of the agreement to sell nemacolin an impairment charge of 38 million for the year ended december 31 2018 was recorded to property and equipment due to the carrying value of net property and equipment being sold exceeding net sales proceeds based on the results of our periodic reviews we have not recorded any longlived assets impairment charges during the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016

for undeveloped properties including non‑operating real properties when indicators of impairment are present properties are evaluated for impairment and losses are recorded when undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by an asset or market comparisons are less than the asset’s carrying amount the amount of the impairment loss is calculated as the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its fair value which is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis management estimates or market comparisons the fair value measurements employed for our impairment evaluations which are subject to the assumptions and factors as previously discussed were generally based on a review of comparable activities in the marketplace which fall within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy

 

goodwill and other indefinite ‑lived intangible assets 

goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over fair market value of net assets acquired in business combinations intangible assets acquired in business combinations are recorded based upon their fair value at the date of acquisition goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets must be reviewed for impairment at least annually and between annual test dates in certain circumstances as a result of our annual impairment tests none of our reporting units incurred any goodwill impairment charges in 2018 and 2016 for our 2017 annual goodwill impairment tests we utilized the option to perform a step zero analysis for each of our reporting units and concluded it was more likely than not that the fair values of certain reporting units were less than their carrying values we then utilized the twostep quantitative analysis for these reporting units as a result of the twostep quantitative analysis performed in 2017 we recorded impairment charges of 349 million and 31 million related to goodwill and trade names respectively in conjunction with the classification of vicksburg’s operations as assets held for sale at march 31 2018 an impairment charge totaling 98 million to goodwill was recorded 

our indefinite‑lived intangible assets consist of racing and gaming licenses and trade names and are evaluated for impairment annually by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying value any excess of carrying value over the fair value is recognized as an impairment within the consolidated statements of income in the period of review

the gaming and racing licenses were valued in aggregate for each respective property as these licenses are considered to be the most significant asset of the properties and the gaming licenses could not be obtained without holding the racing licenses therefore a market participant would consider the licenses in aggregate the fair value of the licenses is calculated using an excess earnings methodology which is an income approach methodology that allocates the projected cash flows of the property to the gaming license intangible assets less charges for the use of the other identifiable assets of the property including working capital fixed assets and other intangible assets we believe this methodology is appropriate as the gaming licenses are the primary asset to the properties the licenses are linked to each respective facility and it’s the lowest level at which discrete cash flows can be directly attributable to the assets under the gaming legislation applicable to our properties licenses are property specific and can only be acquired if a buyer acquires the existing facility because existing licenses may not be acquired and transferred for use at a different facility the estimated future cash flows of each of our properties was the primary assumption in the valuation of such property

we value trade names using the relief‑from‑royalty method with royalty rates range from 05 ‑ 10 trade names recorded as part of the merger with mtr are amortized on a straight‑line basis over a 35year useful life and the trade names recorded as part of our acquisition of tropicana elgin isle and acquisition of the reno properties are not amortized deemed indefinitelived 

the loyalty programs were valued using a combination of a replacement cost and lost profits analysis and the loyalty programs are amortized on a straight‑line basis over a one to fiveyear useful life 

assessing goodwill and indefinite‑lived intangible assets for impairment is a process that requires significant judgment and involves detailed quantitative and qualitative business‑specific analysis and many individual assumptions which fluctuate between assessments our properties’ estimated future cash flows are a primary assumption in the respective impairment analyses unforeseen events changes in circumstances and market conditions and material differences in estimates of future cash flows could negatively affect the fair value of our assets and result in an impairment charge which could be material cash flow estimates include assumptions regarding factors such as recent and budgeted operating performance net win per unit revenue patron visits growth percentages which are developed considering general macroeconomic conditions as well as competitive impacts from current and anticipated competition through a review of customer market data operating margins and current regulatory social and economic climates these estimates could also be negatively impacted by changes in federal state or local regulations economic downturns or developments and other market conditions affecting travel and access to the properties the most significant of the assumptions used in our valuations include 1 revenue growthdecline percentages 2 discount rates 3 effective income tax rates 4 future terminal values and 5 capital expenditure assumptions these assumptions were developed for each property based on historical trends the current competitive markets in which they operate and projections of future performance and competition

we believe we have used reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the fair value of our goodwill reporting units and other indefinite‑lived intangible assets however these estimates and assumptions could be materially different from actual results if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected or if events occur or circumstances change that would reduce the fair value of our licensing intangibles below the carrying value reflected on the consolidated balance sheet we may be required to conduct an interim test or possibly recognize impairment charges which may be material in future periods

 

self ‑insurance reserves 

we are self‑insured for various levels of general liability employee medical insurance coverage and workers’ compensation coverage insurance claims and reserves include accruals of estimated settlements for known claims as well as accruals of estimates for claims incurred but not yet reported we utilize independent consultants to assist management in its determination of estimated insurance liabilities while the total cost of claims incurred depends on future developments in managements’ opinion recorded reserves are adequate to cover future claims payments selfinsurance reserves for employee medical claims and workers’ compensations are included in accrued payroll and related on the consolidated balance sheets self‑insurance reserves for general liability claims are included in accrued other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets

player loyalty program

we offer programs at our properties whereby participating customers can accumulate points for wagering that can be redeemed for credits for free play on slot machines lodging food and beverage merchandise and in limited situations cash the incentives earned by customers under these programs are based on previous revenue transactions and represent separate performance obligations points earned less estimated breakage are recorded as a reduction of casino revenues at the standalone selling price of the points when earned based upon the retail value of the benefits historical redemption rates and estimated breakage and recognized as departmental revenue based on where such points are redeemed upon fulfillment of the performance obligation the loyalty program liability represents a deferral of revenue until redemption occurs which is typically less than one year

litigation claims and assessments

we utilize estimates for litigation claims and assessments these estimates are based on our knowledge and experience regarding current and past events as well as assumptions about future events if our assessment of such a matter should change we may have to change the estimates which may have an adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows actual results could differ from these estimates

risk factors relating to our operations

our business is sensitive to reductions in discretionary consumer spending as a result of downturns in the economy and other factors outside our control

consumer demand for casino hotel and racetrack properties such as ours is particularly sensitive to downturns in the economy and the associated impact on discretionary spending on leisure activities changes in discretionary consumer spending or consumer preferences brought about by factors such as perceived or actual general economic conditions effects of declines in consumer confidence in the economy the impact of high energy and food costs the increased cost of travel the potential for continued bank failures decreased disposable consumer income and wealth or fears of war and future acts of terrorism could further reduce customer demand for the amenities that we offer in addition increases in gasoline prices including increases prompted by global political and economic instabilities can adversely affect our operations because most of our patrons travel to our properties by car or on airlines that may pass on increases in fuel costs to passengers in the form of higher ticket prices further security concerns terrorist attacks and other geopolitical events can have a material adverse effect on leisure and business travel discretionary spending and other areas of economic behavior that directly impact the gaming and entertainment industries in general and our business in particular economic downturns geopolitical events and other related factors which impact discretionary consumer spending and other economic events that are beyond our control have had direct effects on our business and the tourism industry in the past and could adversely affect us in the future

we face substantial competition in the hotel and casino industry and expect that such competition will continue

the gaming industry is characterized by an increasingly high degree of competition among a large number of participants including landbased casinos dockside casinos riverboat casinos casinos located on racing tracks and casinos located on native american reservations and other forms of legalized gaming such as video gaming terminals vgts at bars restaurants and truck stops we also compete to a lesser extent with other forms of legalized gaming and entertainment such as online computer gambling bingo pull tab games card parlors sports books fantasy sports websites “cruisetonowhere” operations parimutuel or telephonic betting on horse racing and dog racing statesponsored lotteries jaialai and in the future may compete with gaming at other venues in addition we compete more generally with other forms of entertainment for the discretionary spending of our customers

 

gaming competition is intense in most of the markets in which we operate states that already have legalized casino gaming may further expand gaming and other states that have not yet legalized gaming may do so in the future legalized casino gaming in these states and on native american reservations in or nea r our markets or changes to gaming laws in states in which we have operations and in states near our operations could increase competition and could adversely affect our operations there has been significant competition in our markets as a result of the e xpansion of facilities by existing market participants the entrance of new gaming participants into a market or legislative changes in prior years and expanded gaming is under consideration in certain of our markets for example gaming facilities in ohio that commenced operations in recent years present significant competition for mountaineer presque isle downs nemacolin and scioto downs in addition the governor of pennsylvania signed legislation in october 2017 expanding gaming to allow for up to ten additional casino locations video gaming terminals vgts at truck stops interactive gaming igaming gaming at airports and potentially sports wagering further there are two bills pending before the missouri general assembly for the expansion of gam ing by allowing class b gaming licensees and daily fantasy sports licensees to conduct sports wagering and the operation of vlts at various bars restaurants veterans and fraternal organizations and convenience stores throughout the state any such expans ion of legalized gaming could adversely impact our properties 

casino gaming is currently prohibited in several jurisdictions from which the shreveportbossier city and lake charles markets draw customers primarily texas the texas legislature has from time to time considered proposals to legalize gaming and there can be no assurance that casino gaming will not be approved in texas in the future which could have a material adverse effect on eldorado shreveport and isle lake charles additionally since visitors from california comprise a significant portion of our customer base in reno we also compete with native american gaming operations in california native american tribes are allowed to operate slot machines lottery games and banking and percentage games on native american lands although many existing native american gaming facilities in northern california are modest compared to the nevada properties a number of native american tribes have established largescale gaming facilities in california additionally from time to time the state of florida has entered into or amended gaming compacts with native american casinos or enacted amended or discussed possible changes in gaming laws which could have positive or negative impacts on our pompano operations in addition various forms of internet gaming have been approved in nevada new jersey delaware and pennsylvania and legislation permitting internet gaming has been proposed by the federal government and other states the expansion of internet gaming in nevada and other jurisdictions could result in significant additional competition

increased competition may require us to make substantial capital expenditures to maintain and enhance the competitive positions of our properties to increase the attractiveness and add to the appeal of our facilities because we are highly leveraged after satisfying our obligations under our outstanding indebtedness there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient funds to undertake these expenditures or that we will be able to obtain sufficient financing to fund such expenditures if we are unable to make such expenditures our competitive position could be negatively affected

our operations in certain jurisdictions depend on agreements with third parties

our operations in several jurisdictions depend on agreements with third parties if we are unable to renew these agreements on satisfactory terms as they expire our business may be disrupted and in the event of disruptions in multiple jurisdictions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations for example iowa law requires that each gambling venue in iowa must have a licensed “qualified sponsoring organization” or qso which is a taxexempt nonprofit organization the qso must donate the profits it receives from casino operations to educational civic public charitable patriotic or religious uses each of our three iowa properties has an agreement with a local qso we have the right to renew our agreements for bettendorf and waterloo when they expire in 2025 and 2021 respectively 

the federal interstate horse racing act and the state racing laws in certain jurisdictions where we have racetracks require that in order to simulcast races we have written agreements with the horse owners and trainers at those racetracks or that we share proceeds of slot machines at the applicable racetrack if we fail to maintain operative agreements with the horsemen at our racetracks we will not be permitted to conduct live racing and export and import simulcasting and may not be permitted to continue our gaming operations at the applicable racetrack at those facilities which could have material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

we have a management agreement with nemacolin woodlands resort the owner of the gaming license issued by the pennsylvania gaming control board allowing operation of a casino at the resort under the terms of this agreement we constructed and currently operate a casino at the resort our management agreement is subject to a buyout provision on or after december 31 2021 as well as other terms and conditions which could result in termination of the management agreement the base term of the agreement is ten years with four fiveyear renewal options additionally each party to the management agreement has certain termination rights if the management agreement is terminated we will no longer have the right to manage our casino at nemacolin woodlands resort

 

we are subject to extensive state and local regulation and licensing and gaming authorities have significant control over our operations which could have an adverse effect on our business 

licensing requirements  the ownership and operation of casino gaming riverboat and horseracing facilities are subject to extensive federal state and local regulation and regulatory authorities at the federal state and local levels have broad powers with respect to the licensing of gaming businesses and may revoke suspend condition or limit our gaming or other licenses impose substantial fines and take other actions each of which poses a significant risk to our business financial condition and results of operations we currently hold all state and local licenses and related approvals necessary to conduct our present gaming operations but we must periodically apply to renew many of our licenses and registrations we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such renewals any failure to maintain or renew our existing licenses registrations permits or approvals would have a material adverse effect on us furthermore if additional laws or regulations are adopted or existing laws or regulations are amended these regulations could impose additional restrictions or costs that could have a significant adverse effect on us 

gaming authorities with jurisdiction over our operations may in their discretion require the holder of any securities issued by us to file applications be investigated and be found suitable to own our securities if they have reason to believe that the security ownership would be inconsistent with the declared policies of their respective jurisdictions further the costs of any investigation conducted by any of the gaming authorities under these circumstances must be paid by the applicant and refusal or failure to pay these charges may constitute grounds for a finding that the applicant is unsuitable to own the securities if any of the gaming authorities determines that a person is unsuitable to own our securities then under the applicable gaming or horse racing laws and regulations we can be sanctioned including the loss of approvals that are required for us to continue our gaming operations in the relevant jurisdictions if such unsuitable person does not timely sell our securities

our officers directors and key employees are also subject to a variety of regulatory requirements and various licensing and related approval procedures in the various jurisdictions in which we operate gaming facilities if any of the applicable gaming authorities were to find an officer director or key employee of ours unsuitable for licensing or unsuitable to continue having a relationship with us we would have to sever all relationships with that person furthermore the gaming authorities may require us to terminate the employment of any person who refuses to file appropriate applications either result could materially adversely affect our gaming operations

applicable gaming laws and regulations restrict our ability to issue securities incur debt and undertake other financing activities such transactions would generally require approval of applicable gaming authorities and our financing counterparties including lenders might be subject to various licensing and related approval procedures in the various jurisdictions in which we operate gaming facilities if state regulatory authorities were to find any person unsuitable with regard to his her or its relationship to us or any of our subsidiaries we would be required to sever our relationships with that person which could materially adversely affect our business

compliance with other laws  we are also subject to a variety of other federal state and local laws rules regulations and ordinances that apply to nongaming businesses including zoning environmental construction and landuse laws and regulations governing smoking and the serving of alcoholic beverages legislation in various forms to ban indoor tobacco smoking has been enacted or introduced in many states and local jurisdictions including several of the jurisdictions in which we operate if additional restrictions on smoking are enacted in our jurisdictions we could experience a significant decrease in gaming revenue and particularly if such restrictions are not applicable to all competitive facilities in that gaming market our business could be materially adversely affected under various federal state and local laws and regulations an owner or operator of real property may be held liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances or wastes located on its property regardless of whether or not the present owner or operator knows of or is responsible for the presence of such substances or wastes we have not identified any issues associated with our properties that could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on us or the results of our operations however several of our properties are located in industrial areas or were used for industrial purposes for many years as a consequence it is possible that historical or neighboring activities have affected one or more of our properties and that as a result environmental issues could arise in the future the precise nature of which we cannot now predict the coverage and attendant compliance costs associated with these laws regulations and ordinances may result in future additional costs 

 

regulations adopted by fincen require us to report currency transactions in excess of 10000 occurring within a gaming day including identification of the patron by name and social security number us treasury department regulations also require us to report certain suspicious activity including any transaction that excee ds 5000 if we know suspect or have reason to believe that the transaction involves funds from illegal activity or is designed to evade federal regulations or reporting requirements substantial penalties can be imposed if we fail to comply with these r egulations fincen has recently increased its focus on gaming companies 

we are required to report certain customer’s gambling winnings via form w2g to comply with current internal revenue service regulations should these regulations change we would expect to incur additional costs to comply with the revised reporting requirements 

taxation and fees  in addition gaming companies are generally subject to significant revenuebased taxes and fees in addition to normal federal state and local income taxes and such taxes and fees are subject to increase at any time we pay substantial taxes and fees with respect to our operations from time to time federal state and local legislators and officials have proposed changes in tax laws or in the administration of such laws affecting the gaming industry in addition worsening economic conditions could intensify the efforts of state and local governments to raise revenues through increases in gaming taxes andor property taxes it is not possible to determine with certainty the likelihood of changes in tax laws or in the administration of such laws such changes if adopted could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations the large number of state and local governments with significant current or projected budget deficits makes it more likely that those governments that currently permit gaming will seek to fund such deficits with new or increased gaming taxes andor property taxes and worsening economic conditions could intensify those efforts any material increase or the adoption of additional taxes or fees could have a material adverse effect on our future financial results 

income taxes we are subject to tax in multiple us tax jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes deferred tax assets or liabilities and in evaluating our tax positions while we believe our tax positions are consistent with the tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business it is possible that these positions may be overturned by jurisdictional tax authorities which may have a significant impact on our provision for income taxes 

tax laws are dynamic and subject to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of the law are issued or applied the us recently enacted significant tax reform and certain provisions of the new law may adversely affect us in addition governmental tax authorities are increasingly scrutinizing the tax positions of companies if us or state tax authorities change applicable tax laws our overall taxes could increase and our business financial condition or results of operations may be adversely impacted

we rely on our key personnel and we may face difficulties in attracting and retaining qualified employees for our casinos and race tracks

our future success will depend upon among other things our ability to keep our senior executives and highly qualified employees we compete with other potential employers for employees and we may not succeed in hiring or retaining the executives and other employees that we need a sudden loss of or inability to replace key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operation

in addition the operation of our business requires qualified executives managers and skilled employees with gaming and horse racing industry experience and qualifications who are able to obtain the requisite licenses and approval from the applicable gaming authorities while not currently the case there has from time to time been a shortage of skilled labor in our markets in addition to limitations that may otherwise exist in the supply of skilled labor the continued expansion of gaming near our facilities including the expansion of native american gaming may make it more difficult for us to attract qualified individuals while we believe that we will continue to be able to attract and retain qualified employees shortages of skilled labor will make it increasingly difficult and expensive to attract and retain the services of a satisfactory number of qualified employees and we may incur higher costs than expected as a result

 

work stoppages organizing drives and other labor problems could negatively i mpact our future profits 

as of december 31 2017 we had 11 collective bargaining agreements covering approximately 970 employees a lengthy strike or other work stoppages at any of our casino properties could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations given the large number of employees labor unions are making a concerted effort to recruit more employees in the gaming industry including at some of our properties as a result we cannot provide any assurance that we will not experience additional and more successful union organization activity in the future

some of our casinos are located on leased property if we default on one or more leases the applicable lessors could terminate the affected leases and we could lose possession of the affected casino 

we lease certain parcels of land on which several of our properties are located as a ground lessee we have the right to use the leased land however we do not hold fee ownership in the underlying land accordingly with respect to the leased land we will have no interest in the land or improvements thereon at the expiration of the ground leases moreover since we do not completely control the land underlying the property a landowner could take certain actions to disrupt our rights in the land leased under the longterm leases which are beyond our control if the entity owning any leased land chose to disrupt our use either permanently or for a significant period of time then the value of our assets could be impaired and our business and operations could be adversely affected if we were to default on any one or more of these leases the applicable lessors could terminate the affected leases and we could lose possession of the affected land and any improvements on the land including the hotels and casinos this would have a significant adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations as we would then be unable to operate all or portions of the affected facilities and may result in the default under our new credit facility

because we own real property we will be subject to extensive environmental regulation which creates uncertainty regarding future environmental expenditures and liabilities

we are subject to various federal state and local environmental health and safety laws and regulations that govern activities that may have adverse environmental effects such as discharges to air and water as well as the use storage discharge emission and disposal of solid animal and hazardous wastes and exposure to hazardous materials these laws and regulations are complex and frequently subject to change in addition our horseracing facilities are subject to laws and regulations that address the impacts of manure and wastewater generated by concentrated animal feeding operations “cafo” on water quality including but not limited to storm water discharges cafo regulations include permit requirements and water quality discharge standards enforcement of cafo regulations has been receiving increased governmental attention compliance with these and other environmental laws can in some circumstances require significant capital expenditures we have from time to time been responsible for investigating and remediating or contributing to remediation costs related to contamination located at or near certain of our facilities including contamination related to underground storage tanks and groundwater contamination arising from prior uses of land on which certain of our facilities are located in addition we have been and may in the future be required to manage abate remove or contain manure and wastewater generated by concentrated animal feeding operations due to our racetrack operations mold lead asbestos‑containing materials or other hazardous conditions found in or on our properties moreover violations can result in significant fines or penalties and in some instances interruption or cessation of operations

we are also subject to laws and regulations that create liability and cleanup responsibility for releases of regulated materials into the environment certain of these laws and regulations impose strict and under certain circumstances joint and several liability on a current or previous owner or operator of property for the costs of remediating regulated materials on or emanating from its property the costs of investigation remediation or removal of those substances may be substantial

 

an earthquake hurricane flood other natural disaster or act of terrorism could adversely affect our business 

the operations of our facilities are subject to disruption or reduced patronage as a result of severe weather conditions natural disasters and other casualty events the reno area has been and may in the future be subject to earthquakes and other natural disasters and eldorado shreveport is located in a designated flood zone because many of our gaming operations are located on or adjacent to bodies of water these facilities are subject to risks in addition to those associated with other casinos including loss of service due to casualty forces of nature mechanical failure extended or extraordinary maintenance flood hurricane or other severe weather conditions and other disasters for example flooding along the mississippi river can impact five or more of our properties and result in them being closed for differing periods of time our properties in florida and louisiana are particularly vulnerable to hurricanes wind and storm surge our pompano property was closed for four days in 2017 because of storms in addition severe weather such as high winds and blizzards occasionally limits access to our landbased facilities in colorado and reno inadequate insurance or lack of available insurance for these and other certain types or levels of risk could expose us to significant losses in the event that a catastrophe occurred for which we are underinsured in addition to the damage caused to our properties by a casualty loss we may suffer business disruption as a result of the casualty event or be subject to claims by third parties that may be injured or harmed while we carry general liability insurance and business interruption insurance there can be no assurance that insurance will be available or adequate to cover all loss and damage to which our business or our assets might be subjected in addition certain casualty events such as labor strikes nuclear events loss of income due to terrorism deterioration or corrosion insect or animal damage and pollution may not be covered under our policies any losses we incur that are not adequately covered by insurance may decrease our future operating income require us to fund replacements or repairs for destroyed property and reduce the funds available for payments of our obligations further we renew our insurance policies on an annual basis the cost of coverage may become so high that we may need to further reduce our policy limits or agree to certain exclusions from coverage among other factors it is possible that regional political tensions homeland security concerns other catastrophic events or any change in government legislation governing insurance coverage for acts of terrorism could materially adversely affect available insurance coverage and result in increased premiums on available coverage which may cause us to elect to reduce our policy limits additional exclusions from coverage or higher deductibles among other potential future adverse changes in the future we may elect to not or may not be able to obtain any coverage for losses due to acts of terrorism

we are subject to risks relating to mechanical failure forces of nature casualty extraordinary maintenance and other causes

all of our facilities will generally be subject to the risk that operations could be halted for a temporary or extended period of time as the result of casualty forces of nature mechanical failure or extended or extraordinary maintenance among other causes in addition our gaming operations could be damaged or halted due to extreme weather conditions these risks are particularly pronounced at our riverboat and dockside facilities because of their locations on and adjacent to water

we are or may become involved in legal proceedings that if adversely adjudicated or settled could impact our business and financial condition

from time to time we are named in lawsuits or other legal proceedings relating to our respective businesses in particular the nature of our business subjects us to the risk of lawsuits filed by customers past and present employees competitors business partners and others in the ordinary course of business as with all legal proceedings no assurances can be given as to the outcome of these matters moreover legal proceedings can be expensive and time consuming and we may not be successful in defending or prosecuting these lawsuits which could result in settlements or damages that could significantly impact our business financial condition and results of operations

 

our information technology and other systems are subject to cyber security risk including misappropriation of customer information or other breaches of information security 

we collect information relating to our guests and employees for various business purposes including marketing and promotional purposes the collection and use of personal data are governed by privacy laws and regulations enacted in the united states we rely on information technology and other systems to maintain and transmit this personal and financial information credit card settlements credit card funds transmissions mailing lists and reservations information our information and processes are subject to the everchanging threat of compromised security in the form of a risk of potential breach system failure computer virus or unauthorized or fraudulent use by customers company employees or employees of third party vendors the steps we take to deter and mitigate these risks may not be successful and any resulting compromise or loss of data or systems could adversely impact operations or regulatory compliance and could result in remedial expenses fines litigation and loss of reputation potentially impacting our financial results

in addition third party service providers and other business partners process and maintain proprietary business information and data related to our guests suppliers and other business partners our information technology and other systems that maintain and transmit this information or those of service providers or business partners may also be compromised by a malicious third party penetration of our network security or that of a third party service provider or business partner or impacted by intentional or unintentional actions or inactions by our employees or those of a third party service provider or business partner as a result our business information guest supplier and other business partner data may be lost disclosed accessed or taken without their consent

any such loss disclosure or misappropriation of or access to guests’ or business partners’ information or other breach of our information security can result in legal claims or legal proceedings including regulatory investigations and actions may have a serious impact on our reputation and may adversely affect our businesses operating results and financial condition furthermore the loss disclosure or misappropriation of our business information may adversely affect our reputation businesses operating results and financial condition  

our operations have historically been subject to seasonal variations and quarterly fluctuations in operating results and we can expect to experience such variations and fluctuations in the future

historically our operations have typically been subject to seasonal variations our strongest operating results for our reno properties have generally occurred in the second and third quarters and the weakest results have generally occurred during the period from november through february when weather conditions adversely affected operating results winter conditions can frequently adversely affect transportation routes to reno where a significant of our visitors arrive by ground transportation and certain of our other properties and cause cancellations of live horse racing for example the renotahoe area experienced exceptionally high levels of snowfall in the first quarter of 2017 with certain resorts in the tahoe area reporting over 50 feet of snowfall during such time which adversely affected visitation to our reno properties and adversely affected our results of operations for the first quarter as a result unfavorable seasonal conditions could have a material adverse effect on our operations

the concentration and evolution of the slot machine manufacturing industry could impose additional costs on us

there are a limited number of slot machine manufacturers servicing the gaming industry and a large majority of our revenues are derived from slot machines at our casinos it is important for competitive reasons that we offer the most popular and uptodate slot machine games with the latest technology to customers 

in recent years slot machine manufacturers have frequently refused to sell slot machines featuring the most popular games instead requiring participating lease arrangements generally a participating lease is substantially more expensive over the longterm than the cost to purchase a new slot machine 

for competitive reasons we may be forced to acquire new slot machines slot machine systems or gaming and hotel technology and equipment or enter into participating lease arrangements that are more expensive than our costs associated with the continued operation of our existing slot machines equipment and software if the newer slot machines equipment or software do not result in sufficient incremental revenues to offset the increased investment or if we are unable to successfully implement new software or technology it could adversely affect our operations and profitability 

 

we face risks associated with growth and acquisitions 

as part of our business strategy we regularly evaluate opportunities for growth through development of gaming operations in existing or new markets through acquiring other gaming entertainment facilities or through redeveloping our existing gaming facilities in the future we may also pursue expansion opportunities including joint ventures in jurisdictions where casino gaming is not currently permitted in order to be prepared to develop projects upon approval of casino gaming 

although we only intend to engage in acquisitions that if consummated will be accretive to us and our stockholders we cannot be sure that we will be able to identify attractive acquisition opportunities or that we will experience the return on investment that we expect in addition acquisitions require significant management attention and resources to integrate new properties businesses and operations potential difficulties we may encounter as part of the integration process include 







in addition it is possible that the integration process could result in 







any of which could adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with customers suppliers employees and other constituencies or our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits or could reduce our earnings or otherwise adversely affect our business and financial results 

there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify acquire develop or profitably manage additional companies or operations or successfully integrate such companies or operations into our existing operations without substantial costs delays or other problems additionally there can be no assurance that we will receive gaming or other necessary licenses or approvals for new projects that we may pursue or that gaming will be approved in jurisdictions where it is not currently approved

we may experience construction delays or cost overruns during our expansion or development projects that could adversely affect our operations

from time to time we may commence construction projects on new properties or at our current properties we also evaluate other expansion opportunities as they become available and may in the future engage in additional construction projects the anticipated costs and construction periods for construction projects are based upon budgets conceptual design documents and construction schedule estimates prepared by us in consultation with our architects construction projects entail significant risks which can substantially increase costs or delay completion of a project such risks include shortages of materials or skilled labor unforeseen engineering environmental or geological problems work stoppages weather interference and unanticipated cost increases most of these factors are beyond our control in addition difficulties or delays in obtaining any of the requisite licenses permits or authorizations from regulatory authorities can increase the cost or delay the completion of an expansion or development significant budget overruns or delays with respect to expansion and development projects could adversely affect our results of operations

 

our planned capital expenditures may not result in our expected improvements in our business 

we regularly expend capital to construct maintain and renovate our properties to remain competitive maintain the value and brand standards of our properties and comply with applicable laws and regulations our ability to realize the expected returns on our capital investments is dependent on a number of factors including general economic conditions changes to construction plans and specifications delays in obtaining or inability to obtain necessary permits licenses and approvals disputes with contractors disruptions to our business caused by construction and other unanticipated circumstances or cost increases

while we believe that the overall budgets for our planned capital expenditures are reasonable these costs are estimates and the actual costs may be higher than expected in addition we can provide no assurance that these investments will be sufficient or that we will realize our expected returns on our capital investments or any returns at all a failure to realize our expected returns on capital investments could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations

we may incur impairments to goodwill indefinitelived intangible assets or longlived assets which could negatively affect our operating results

as of december 31 2017 we had 17 billion of goodwill and other intangible assets we perform annual impairment testing for goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets as of october 1 or on an interim basis if indicators of impairment exist for properties with goodwill andor other intangible assets with indefinite lives these tests could require the comparison of the implied fair value of each reporting unit to carrying value during the fourth quarter of 2017 we recorded an impairment charge totaling 380 million to reduce the carrying value of goodwill andor trade names related to our lake charles lula and vicksburg reporting units

we must make various assumptions and estimates in performing our impairment testing the implied fair value includes estimates of future cash flows that are based on reasonable and supportable assumptions which represent our best estimates of the cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets including their eventual disposition and by a market approach based upon valuation multiples for similar companies changes in estimates increases in our cost of capital reductions in transaction multiples operating and capital expenditure assumptions or application of alternative assumptions and definitions could produce significantly different results

we also evaluate longlived assets for impairment if indicators of impairment exist in assessing the recoverability of the carrying value of such property equipment and other longlived assets we make assumptions regarding future cash flows and residual values

future cash flow estimates are by their nature subjective and actual results may differ materially from our estimates if our ongoing estimates of future cash flows are not met we may have to record additional impairment charges in future accounting periods our estimates of cash flows are based on the current regulatory social and economic climates recent operating information and budgets and current operating plans of the various properties where we conduct operations these estimates could be negatively impacted by changes in federal state or local regulations economic downturns internal operating decisions or other events affecting various forms of travel and access to our properties

risks related to our capital structure and equity ownership

we have significant indebtedness

as of december 31 2017 we and our restricted subsidiaries had 22 billion of total indebtedness outstanding consisting of 9568 million outstanding under our term loan facility the “new term loan facility” or “new term loan” 8750 million in aggregate principal amount of outstanding 60 senior notes due 2025 the “6 senior notes” and 3750 million in aggregate principal amount of outstanding 70 senior notes due 2023 the “7 senior notes” as of december 31 2017 we had no borrowings outstanding under our 3000 million revolving credit facility the “new revolving credit facility” and together with the new term loan the “new credit facility” this indebtedness may have important negative consequences for us including





 





















despite our current indebtedness levels we and our subsidiaries may still incur significant additional indebtedness incurring more indebtedness could increase the risks associated with our substantial indebtedness 

we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness including additional secured indebtedness in the future as of december 31 2017 we had 2916 million of borrowing capacity after consideration of 84 million in outstanding letters of credit under our new credit facility our existing debt agreements currently permit and we expect that agreements governing debt that we incur in the future will permit us to incur certain other additional secured and unsecured debt further we may incur other liabilities that do not constitute indebtedness the risks that we face based on our outstanding indebtedness may intensify if we incur additional indebtedness in the future

we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness which may not be successful

our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial business legislative regulatory and other factors beyond our control we cannot assure you that we will maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal premium if any and interest on our indebtedness

if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to sell assets seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness these alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations if our operating results and available cash are insufficient to meet our debt service obligations we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations we may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain the proceeds that we could realize from them and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due additionally the agreements governing our existing debt limit the use of the proceeds from any disposition as a result we may not be allowed under these documents to use proceeds from such dispositions to satisfy all current debt service obligations

 

the agreements governing our debt impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries which may preven t us from capitalizing on business opportunities 

the agreements governing our existing debt impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us these restrictions limit our ability among other things to

















in addition the credit agreement governing the new credit facility contains certain financial covenants including minimum interest coverage ratio and maximum total leverage ratio covenants

as a result of these covenants and restrictions we are limited in how we conduct our business and we may be unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities the restrictions caused by such covenants could also place us at a competitive disadvantage to less leveraged competitors

a failure to comply with the covenants contained in the agreements governing our existing or future indebtedness could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could result in the acceleration of the indebtedness and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations if our indebtedness were to be accelerated there can be no assurance that our assets would be sufficient to repay such indebtedness in full moreover in the event that such indebtedness is accelerated there can be no assurance that we will be able to refinance it on acceptable terms or at all

the market price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly

the us securities markets in general have experienced significant price fluctuations in recent years the market price of our common stock may be volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in addition the trading volume of our common stock may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur some of the factors that could cause fluctuations in or have a material adverse effect on the stock price or trading volume of our common stock include

























 

we cannot assure you that the stock price of our common stock will not fluctuate or decline significantly in the future in addition the stock market in general can experience considerable price and volume fluctuations that may be unrelated to our performance if the market price of our common stock fluctuates significantly we may become the subject of securities class action litigation which may result i n substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources 

we have not historically paid dividends and may not pay dividends in the future

we do not currently expect to pay dividends on its common stock any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon among other factors our earnings cash requirements financial condition requirements to comply with the covenants under its debt instruments legal considerations and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant in addition the agreements governing our indebtedness restrict its ability to pay dividends if we do not pay dividends then the return on an investment in its common stock will depend entirely upon any future appreciation in its stock price there is no guarantee that our common stock will appreciate in value or maintain its value

significant factors impacting financial results

transaction expenses related to our acquisition of isle for legal accounting financial advisory services severance stock awards and other costs totaled 928 million and 86 million for the years ending december 31 2017 and 2016 respectively



in previous periods the operations of lake charles have been classified as discontinued operations and as an asset held for sale as a result of the termination of the sale lake charles is no longer classified as an asset held for sale and accounted for as discontinued operations and is included in our results of operations for the eightmonth period from the date we acquired isle through december 31 2017 



 



on september 13 2017 we issued an additional 500 million in aggregate principal amount of 6 senior notes at an issue price equal to 1055 of the principal amount we used the proceeds of the offering to repay all of the outstanding borrowings under the new revolving credit facility totaling 780 million and used the remainder to repay outstanding borrowings totaling 4445 million under the new term loan plus related accrued interest we recognized a loss of 111 million as a result of the issuance of additional debt and retirement of existing debt





our west segment’s operations are subject to seasonal variation with our lowest business volume generally occurring during the winter months the northern nevada region experienced record snowfall and severe weather conditions including major snow storms during eleven of the fourteen weekends in the 2017 first quarter making travel to reno from northern california our main feeder market difficult or impossible due to road closures as a result there was a significant adverse effect on business levels especially hotel occupancy and gaming volume during the first quarter of 2017 and our operating performance for the year ended december 31 2017 compared to 2016





our master capital plan initiated in 2016 at eldorado reno silver legacy and circus reno the “triproperties” continued throughout 2017 as of december 31 2017 we have completed upgrades to nearly 1000 hotel rooms and suites updated food and beverage operations across the facilities with eight new or redesigned restaurants cafes or bars renovated the carnival midway created new public spaces in all three properties and opened a new poker room and sports book

results of operations

the following table highlights the results of our operations dollars in thousands

 



 

operating results  isle contributed 5996 million of net revenues from the date we acquired isle through december 31 2017 consisting primarily of gaming revenues including the incremental isle net operating revenues net revenues increased 650 for the year ended december 31 2017 compared to 2016 excluding incremental isle net revenues net revenues declined 21 for the year ended december 31 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to decreased revenues associated with severe weather during the first and third quarters of 2017 

net revenues increased 241 in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to incremental revenues attributable to the acquisition of the reno properties these increases in net revenues were partially offset by decreases in net revenues in the south and east segments which were mainly driven by declines at mountaineer in 2016 compared to 2015 due to lower casino revenues attributable to a competitive opening in one of our feeder markets

operating income increased 65 for the year ended december 31 2017 compared to 2016 this increase was primarily due to 823 million of incremental operating income contributed by isle for the period from the date we acquired isle through december 31 2017 and a 200 million deposit recorded as operating income in conjunction with the termination of the sale our lake charles property these increases were partially offset by the 836 million increase in transaction expenses associated with our acquisition of isle and the 380 million impairment charge recorded in 2017 to reduce the carrying value of goodwill andor trade names related to our lake charles lula and vicksburg reporting units

operating income increased 229 in 2016 compared to 2015 due to higher net revenues combined with improved operating margins associated with companywide cost savings initiatives and property enhancement capital expenditures these increases in operating income were partially offset by incremental depreciation expense resulting from the acquisition of the reno properties along with higher acquisition costs associated with our acquisition of isle which was announced in september of 2016

net income increased 1981 in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to the 1124 million net adjustment to our deferred income tax benefit for the year ending december 31 2017 as a result of the aforementioned corporate tax rate reduction due to the tax act combined with the other factors impacting operating income this increase was partially offset by higher interest expense resulting from the issuance of new debt and the loss on the early retirement of debt recorded in 2017 

net income decreased 783 in 2016 compared to 2015 despite the increase in operating income this decline was primarily driven by a 356 million gain related to the valuation of the silver legacy joint venture in conjunction with the acquisition of the reno properties combined with a 696 million benefit for income taxes recorded in 2015 additionally net income in 2016 was impacted by transaction expenses totaling 92 million primarily related to our acquisition of isle a 08 million loss on the sale and disposal of a building and equipment related to the closure of a detached fitness center facility at mountaineer and incremental depreciation associated with assets purchased in the acquisition of the reno properties these declines in net income were partially offset by a 106 million decrease in interest expense in 2016 resulting from our refinancing in july 2015 and significant debt reductions throughout 2016

excluding incremental isle gaming revenues and parimutuel commissions of 5582 million gaming revenues declined 25 for the year ended december 31 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to a decrease in gaming revenues across all segments the decline in the west segment was mainly attributable to decreases in visitor traffic due to severe weather the northern nevada region experienc ed throughout the first quarter of 2017 that resulted in limited access from our main feeder markets combined with the absence of a major bowling tournament in the reno market additionally reductions in gaming volume driven by decreased highend play th e continued weakness in the energy sector and historically lower table games hold percentage impacted the shreveport market and severe weather in the third quarter of 2017 negatively impacted the south segment in 2017 efforts to eliminate unprofitable gam ing play via reductions in marketing promotions and incentives across the properties also contributed to the declines in casino volume and positively impacted margins across all segments

excluding incremental isle nongaming revenues of 917 million nongaming revenues decreased 33 for the year ended december 31 2017 compared to 2016 the west segment declined for the year ended december 31 2017 compared to 2016 principally due to lower hotel food and beverage revenues resulting from reduced customer traffic due to fewer convention room nights severe weather in the northern nevada region throughout the first quarter of 2017 and the absence of a major bowling tournament during 2017 the south segment decrease in nongaming revenues for the year ended december 31 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to decreased food and beverage revenues associated with revisions to marketing strategies resulting in fewer complimentary food offers and severe weather negatively impacting visitation in 2017 nongaming revenues in the east segment decreased for the year ended december 31 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to decreased food and beverage revenues resulting from reductions in complimentary food offers and the consolidation of restaurants in an effort to maximize capacity utilization

promotional allowances  promotional allowances expressed as a percentage of gaming revenues and parimutuel commissions decreased to 107 for the year ended december 31 2017 compared to 129 in 2016 this decline was primarily due to strategic revisions to promotional offers across all segments combined with the incremental revenues contributed by the isle properties which historically have lower promotional allowances as a percentage of gaming revenues 

gaming expenses and parimutuel commissions  isle contributed 2695 million of gaming expenses and parimutuel commissions for the period from the date we acquired isle through december 31 2017 resulting in an increase of 629 over 2016 

excluding incremental isle gaming expenses and parimutuel commissions gaming expenses and parimutuel commissions decreased 41 for the year ended december 31 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to decreases in gaming volume combined with savings initiatives targeted at reducing variable expenses along with continued synergies related to the integration of the reno properties in the west segment additionally successful efforts to control costs and maximize departmental profit across all segments also drove the decline in expenses during the current period

nongaming expenses isle contributed 301 million of nongaming expenses for the period from the date we acquired isle through december 31 2017 resulting in an increase of 111 over 2016

excluding incremental isle marketing and promotions expenses consolidated marketing and promotions expense increased 151 for the year ended december 31 2017 compared to 2016 this increase was primarily attributable to marketing promotional costs associated with casino initiatives that are charged to this category to provide consistency among properties following our acquisition of isle

general and administrative expenses  isle contributed 1136 million of general and administrative expense for the period from the date we acquired isle through december 31 2017 resulting in an increase of 852 over 2016 

excluding incremental isle general and administrative expenses consolidated general and administrative expenses decreased 14 for the year ended december 31 2017 compared to 2016 savings associated with lower property and general liability insurance costs were partially offset by higher expenses associated with information systems maintenance contracts and professional services these incremental costs resulted from information technology infrastructure projects targeted at consolidating systems for future savings and efficiencies

 

 

corporate expenses  for the year ended december 31 2017 compared to 2016 corporate expenses increased due to payroll and other expenses associated with additional corporate expenses driven by growth related to the isle acquisition also the increase was the result of higher stock compensation expense for the year ended december 31 2017 compared to 2016 due to the threeyear vesting schedule associated with our longterm incentive plan established in 2015 resulting in three years of grants and related expense in 2017 versus two years of grants and related expense in 2016 

impairment charges during the fourth quarter of 2017 we conducted annual impairment tests of our intangible assets based on less than expected operating performance and projected future operating results it was determined that the value of goodwill andor trade names associated with our lake charles vicksburg and lula reporting units were impaired resulting in impairment charges totaling 380 million 349 million related to goodwill and 31 million related to trade names recorded in the current year

excluding incremental isle depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization expense decreased 73 for the year ended december 31 2017 compared to 2016 mainly due to lower depreciation in all segments due to assets becoming fully depreciated

benefit provision for income taxes  as further explained below in “ critical accounting policies – income taxes ” on december 22 2017 the us government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act the tax act makes broad and complex changes to the us tax code including but not limited to reducing the us federal corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 in connection with our initial analysis of the impact of the tax act for certain of our net deferred tax liabilities we have recorded a decrease of 1124 million net of the related change in valuation allowance with a corresponding net adjust ment to deferred income tax benefit for the year ending december 31 2017 as a result of the corporate rate reduction

critical accounting policies

our significant accounting policies are included in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements which are included elsewhere in this report these policies along with the underlying assumptions and judgments made by our management in their application have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty and actual results could differ from our estimates

 

business combinations 

we applied the provisions of accounting standards codification “asc” topic 805 “business combinations” in the accounting for the merger with mtr acquisition of the reno properties and our acquisition of isle it required us to recognize the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair values goodwill as of their respective acquisition dates were measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed

accounting for business combinations required our management to make significant estimates and assumptions including our estimate of intangible assets such as gaming licenses trade names and loyalty programs although we believe the assumptions and estimates made have been reasonable and appropriate they are inherently uncertain for our gaming license valuation our properties estimated future cash flows were the primary assumption in the respective intangible valuations cash flow estimates included assumptions regarding factors such as recent and budgeted operating performance net win per unit revenue patron visits and growth percentages the growth percentages were developed considering general macroeconomic conditions as well as competitive impacts from current and anticipated competition through a review of customer market data operating margins and current regulatory social and economic climates the most significant of the assumptions used in the valuations included 1 revenue growthdecline percentages 2 discount rates 3 effective income tax rates 4 future terminal values and 5 capital expenditure assumptions these assumptions were developed for each of our properties based on historical trends in the current competitive markets in which they operate and projections of future performance and competition the primary assumptions with respect to our trade names and loyalty program intangibles primary assumptions were selecting the appropriate royalty rates and cost estimates for replacement cost analyses

in addition uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed in connection with a business combination are initially estimated as of the business combination date we reevaluated these items quarterly based upon facts and circumstances that existed as of the business combination date with any adjustments to our preliminary estimates being recorded to goodwill if identified within the measurement period subsequent to the measurement period or our final determination of the tax allowance’s or contingency’s estimated value whichever comes first changes to these uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances will affect our provision for income taxes in our consolidated statements of income and could have material impact on our results of operations and financial position

income taxes

we and our subsidiaries file us federal income tax returns and various state and local income tax returns we do not have tax sharing agreements with the other members within the consolidated eri group with few exceptions we are no longer subject to us federal or state and local tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2012

we were notified by the internal revenue service in october of 2016 that its federal tax return for the year ended december 31 2014 had been selected for examination in september 2017 the internal revenue service informed us that they completed the examination of the tax return and made no changes however we may be subject to tax audits in the future and the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty if any issues addressed in our tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with our expectations we would be required to adjust our provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs while we believe our reported results are materially accurate any significant adjustments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows and financial position

 

on december 22 2017 the us government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as t he tax cuts and jobs act the tax act makes broad and complex changes to the us tax code including but not limited to 1 reducing the us federal corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 2 eliminating the corporate alternative minimum tax amt and cha nging how existing amt credits can be realized 3 creating a new limitation on deductible interest expense 4 changing rules related to uses and limitations of net operating loss carryforwards created in tax years beginning after december 31 2017 5 bonus depreciation that will allow for full expensing of qualified property and 6 limitations on the deductibility of certain executive compensation 

the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin “sab” 118 which provides guidance on accounting for the tax effects of the tax act sab 118 provides a measurement period that should not extend beyond one year from the tax act enactment date for companies to complete the accounting under asc 740 in accordance with sab 118 a company must reflect the income tax effects of those aspects of the tax act for which the accounting under asc 740 is complete to the extent that a company’s accounting for certain income tax effects of the tax act is incomplete but it is able to determine a reasonable estimate it must record a provisional estimate in the financial statements if a company cannot determine a provisional estimate to be included in the financial statements it should continue to apply asc 740 on the basis of the provisions of the tax laws that were in effect immediately before the enactment of the tax act

in connection with our initial analysis of the impact of the tax act for certain of our net deferred tax liabilities we have recorded a decrease of 1124 million net of the related change in valuation allowance with a corresponding net adjustment to deferred income tax benefit for the year ending december 31 2017 as a result of the corporate rate reduction for various reasons that are discussed more fully below we have not completed our accounting for the income tax effects of certain elements of the tax act therefore we have made reasonable estimates of the effects of the elements for which our analysis is not yet complete

while we have not yet completed all of the computations necessary or completed an inventory of our 2017 expenditures that qualify for immediate expensing we have recorded a provisional benefit based on our current intent to fully expense all qualifying expenditures this did not result in any significant change to our current income tax payable or in our deferred tax liabilities due to our federal and state net operating loss carry forwards

for the year ended december 31 2015 the difference between the effective rate and the statutory rate is attributable primarily to the release of a majority of the federal and related state valuation allowances on our deferred tax assets and the nontaxable gain on the fair value adjustment of a previously unconsolidated affiliate we continue to provide for a valuation allowance against net federal and state deferred tax assets associated with nonoperating land the sale of which could result in capital losses that can only be offset against capital gains as of december 31 2015 we also continued to provide for a valuation allowance against net state deferred tax assets relating to operations in pennsylvania and west virginia management determined it was not morelikelythannot that we will realize these net deferred tax assets

for the year ended december 31 2017 the difference between the effective rate and the statutory rate is attributable primarily to the impact of the tax act discussed more fully above nondeductible asset impairment charges nondeductible transaction costs incurred and changes in the effective state tax rate associated with the acquisition of isle of capri casinos inc and the release of the valuation allowance against certain pennsylvania deferred tax assets  we continue to provide for a valuation allowance against net federal and state deferred tax assets associated with nonoperating land the sale of which could result in capital losses that can only be offset against capital gains we also continue to provide for a valuation allowance against net state deferred tax assets relating to certain operations in pennsylvania louisiana colorado and iowa management determined it was not morelikelythannot that we will realize these net deferred tax assets

a valuation allowance is recognized if based on the weight of available evidence it is morelikelythannot that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized management must analyze all available positive and negative evidence regarding realization of the deferred tax assets and make an assessment of the likelihood of sufficient future taxable income for the year ended december 31 2015 we were in a threeyear cumulative income position and management concluded it is morelikelythannot to realize its federal louisiana and city of columbus ohio deferred tax assets with the exception of nonoperating land for the year ended december 31 2016 we remained in a threeyear cumulative income position and management concluded it is morelikelythannot to realize its federal louisiana city of columbus ohio and west virginia deferred tax assets with the exception of nonoperating land for the year ended december 31 2017 we remained in a threeyear cumulative income position and management concluded it is morelikelythannot to realize its

for income tax purposes we amortize or depreciate certain assets that have been assigned an indefinite life for book purposes the incremental amortization or depreciation deductions for income tax purposes result in an increase in certain deferred tax liabilities that cannot be used as a source of future taxable income for purposes of measuring our need for a valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets therefore we expect to record non cash deferred tax expense as we amortize these assets for tax purposes  

 

under the applicable accounting standards we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more‑likely‑than‑not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement the accounting standards also provide guidance on de‑recognition classification interest and penalties on income taxes accounting in interim periods and disclosure requirements for uncertain tax positions we have recorded no liability associated with uncertain tax positions at december 31 2017 and 2016

property and equipment and other long‑lived assets

property and equipment is recorded at cost except for assets acquired in the isle silver legacy circus reno and mtr gaming acquisitions which were adjusted for fair value under asc 805 and are depreciated over their remaining estimated useful life or lease term judgments are made in determining estimated useful lives and salvage values of these assets the accuracy of these estimates affects the amount of depreciation expense recognized in our financial results and whether we have a gain or loss on the disposal of assets we review depreciation estimates and methods as new events occur more experience is acquired and additional information is obtained that would possibly change our current estimates

property equipment and other long‑lived assets are assessed for impairment in accordance with asc 360— property plant and equipment  we evaluate our long‑lived assets periodically for impairment issues or more frequently whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable recoverability of these assets is determined by comparing the net carrying value to the sum of the estimated future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by these assets the amount of impairment loss if any is measured by the difference between the net carrying value and the estimated fair value of the asset which is typically measured using a discounted cash flow model level 3 of the fair value hierarchy for assets to be disposed of impairment is recognized based on the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs of disposal as estimated based on comparable asset sales offers received or a discounted cash flow model based on the results of our periodic reviews we have not recorded any longlived assets impairment charges during the years ended december 31 2017 2016 and 2015

for undeveloped properties including non‑operating real properties when indicators of impairment are present properties are evaluated for impairment and losses are recorded when undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by an asset or market comparisons are less than the asset’s carrying amount the amount of the impairment loss is calculated as the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its fair value which is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis management estimates or market comparisons the fair value measurements employed for our impairment evaluations which are subject to the assumptions and factors as previously discussed were generally based on a review of comparable activities in the marketplace which fall within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy

goodwill and other indefinite‑lived intangible assets

goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price paid over the fair value of the net assets of the acquired business intangible assets acquired in business combinations are recorded based upon their fair value at the date of acquisition goodwill and other indefinite‑lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment annually during the fourth quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired

as a result of our annual impairment review impairment charges totaling 349 million and 31 million related to goodwill and trade names respectively were recorded in 2017 the fair value measurements employed for our impairment evaluations which are subject to the assumptions and factors as previously discussed were generally based on a review of comparable activities in the marketplace which fall within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy 

 

goodwill is tested by comparing the carrying value of the reporting unit to its fair value we estimate the fair value of the reporting unit utilizing income and market approaches the income approach is based on projected future cash flow that is discount ed to present value using factors that consider the timing and risk of the future cash flows the market approach is based on our market capitalization at the testing date 

our indefinite‑lived intangible assets consist of racing and gaming licenses and trade names and are evaluated for impairment annually by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying value any excess of carrying value over the fair value is recognized as an impairment within the consolidated statements of income in the period of review

the gaming and racing licenses were valued in aggregate for each respective property as these licenses are considered to be the most significant asset of the properties and the gaming licenses could not be obtained without holding the racing licenses therefore a market participant would consider the licenses in aggregate the fair value of the licenses is calculated using an excess earnings methodology which is an income approach methodology that allocates the projected cash flows of the property to the gaming license intangible assets less charges for the use of the other identifiable assets of the property including working capital fixed assets and other intangible assets we believe this methodology is appropriate as the gaming licenses are the primary asset to the properties the licenses are linked to each respective facility and it’s the lowest level at which discrete cash flows can be directly attributable to the assets under the gaming legislation applicable to our properties licenses are property specific and can only be acquired if a buyer acquires the existing facility because existing licenses may not be acquired and transferred for use at a different facility the estimated future cash flows of each of our properties was the primary assumption in the valuation of such property

we value trade names using the relief‑from‑royalty method with royalty rates range from 05 ‑ 10 trade names recorded as part of the merger with mtr are amortized on a straight‑line basis over a 35 year useful life and the trade names recorded as part of our acquisition of isle and acquisition of the reno properties are not amortized deemed indefinitelived 

the loyalty programs were valued using a combination of a replacement cost and lost profits analysis and the loyalty programs are amortized on a straight‑line basis over a one to threeyear useful life 

assessing goodwill and indefinite‑lived intangible assets for impairment is a process that requires significant judgment and involves detailed quantitative and qualitative business‑specific analysis and many individual assumptions which fluctuate between assessments our properties’ estimated future cash flows are a primary assumption in the respective impairment analyses unforeseen events changes in circumstances and market conditions and material differences in estimates of future cash flows could negatively affect the fair value of our assets and result in an impairment charge which could be material cash flow estimates include assumptions regarding factors such as recent and budgeted operating performance net win per unit revenue patron visits growth percentages which are developed considering general macroeconomic conditions as well as competitive impacts from current and anticipated competition through a review of customer market data operating margins and current regulatory social and economic climates these estimates could also be negatively impacted by changes in federal state or local regulations economic downturns or developments and other market conditions affecting travel and access to the properties the most significant of the assumptions used in our valuations include 1 revenue growthdecline percentages 2 discount rates 3 effective income tax rates 4 future terminal values and 5 capital expenditure assumptions these assumptions were developed for each property based on historical trends the current competitive markets in which they operate and projections of future performance and competition

we believe we have used reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the fair value of our goodwill reporting units and other indefinite‑lived intangible assets however these estimates and assumptions could be materially different from actual results if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected or if events occur or circumstances change that would reduce the fair value of our licensing intangibles below the carrying value reflected on the consolidated balance sheet we may be required to conduct an interim test or possibly recognize impairment charges which may be material in future periods

reserve for uncollectible accounts receivable

we reserve an estimated amount for receivables that may not be collected methodologies for estimating bad debt reserves range from specific reserves to various percentages applied to aged receivables historical collection rates are considered as are customer relationships in determining specific reserves as with many estimates management must make judgments about potential actions by third parties in establishing and evaluating our reserves for bad debts

 

self ‑insurance reserves 

we are self‑insured for various levels of general liability employee medical insurance coverage and workers’ compensation coverage insurance claims and reserves include accruals of estimated settlements for known claims as well as accruals of estimates for claims incurred but not yet reported we utilize independent consultants to assist management in its determination of estimated insurance liabilities while the total cost of claims incurred depends on future developments in managements’ opinion recorded reserves are adequate to cover future claims payments selfinsurance reserves for employee medical claims and workers’ compensations are included in accrued payroll and related on the consolidated balance sheets self‑insurance reserves for general liability claims are included in accrued other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets

loyalty program

we offer programs whereby our participating patrons can accumulate points for wagering that can be redeemed for credits for free play on slot machines lodging food and beverage merchandise and in limited situations cash based upon the estimated redemptions of loyalty program points an estimated liability is established for the cost of redemption on earned but unredeemed points the estimated cost of redemption utilizes estimates and assumptions of the mix of the various product offerings for which the points will be redeemed and costs of such product offerings changes in the programs membership levels and redemption patterns of our participating patrons can impact this liability

litigation claims and assessments

we utilize estimates for litigation claims and assessments these estimates are based on our knowledge and experience regarding current and past events as well as assumptions about future events if our assessment of such a matter should change we may have to change the estimates which may have an adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows actual results could differ from these estimates

competition 

the gaming industry includes land‑based casinos dockside casinos riverboat casinos casinos located on native american reservations and other forms of legalized gaming there is intense competition among companies in the gaming industry many of which have significantly greater resources than we do certain states have legalized casino gaming and other states may legalize gaming in the future legalized casino gaming in these states and on native american reservations near our markets or changes to gaming laws in states surrounding nevada louisiana west virginia pennsylvania or ohio could increase competition and could adversely affect our operations we also compete to a lesser extent with gaming facilities in other jurisdictions with dockside gaming facilities state sponsored lotteries on‑and‑off track pari‑mutuel wagering card clubs riverboat casinos and other forms of legalized gambling in addition various forms of internet gaming have been approved in nevada and new jersey and legislation permitting internet gaming has been proposed by the federal government and other states the expansion of internet gaming in nevada and other jurisdictions could result in significant additional competition

nevada  of the 30 casinos currently operating in the reno market we believe we compete principally with four other hotel‑casinos that each generate at least 36 million in annual gaming revenues at this time we cannot predict the extent to which new and proposed projects will be undertaken or the extent to which current hotel andor casino space may be expanded we expect that any additional rooms added in the reno market will increase competition for visitor revenue there can be no assurance that any growth in reno’s current room base or gaming capacity will not adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 

we also compete with hotel‑casinos located in the nearby lake tahoe region as well as those in other areas of nevada a substantial number of customers travel to both reno and the lake tahoe area during their visits consequently we believe that our success is influenced to some degree by the success of the lake tahoe market while we do not anticipate a significant change in the popularity of either reno or lake tahoe as tourist destination areas in the foreseeable future any decline could adversely affect our operations

since visitors from california comprise a significant portion of our customer base we also compete with native american gaming operations in california the state of california has signed and ratified compacts with native american tribes including casinos located in northern california which we consider to be a significant target market these native american tribes are allowed to operate slot machines lottery games and banking and percentage games on native american lands

we believe the reno market draws over 50 of its visitors from california as northern california native american gaming operations have expanded we believe the increasing competition generated by these gaming operations has negatively impacted and may continue to negatively impact principally drive‑in day‑trip visitor traffic from our main feeder markets in northern california

louisiana  the shreveportbossier city louisiana gaming market is characterized by intense competition we compete directly with five casinos all but one of which have operated in the shreveportbossier city market for several years and have established customer bases in addition we also compete with the slot machine facility at louisiana downs located in bossier city and winstar casino and casino facilities owned by the choctaw nation located in oklahoma casino gaming is currently prohibited in several jurisdictions from which the shreveportbossier city market draws customers primarily texas the texas legislature has from time to time considered proposals to legalize gaming any such proposal would require an amendment to the texas state constitution which requires approval by two‑thirds of the texas state legislature and approval by a majority of votes cast in a statewide voter referendum such approvals would legalize gaming in texas notwithstanding vetoes by the governor of casino gambling bills there can be no assurance that casino gaming will not be approved in texas in the future which may have a negative effect on our business eldorado shreveport competes with several native american casinos located in oklahoma certain of which are located near our core texas markets because eldorado shreveport draws a significant amount of customers from the dallasfort worth texas area but is located approximately 190 miles from that area we believe we will continue to face increased competition from gaming operations in oklahoma and would face significant competition that may have a negative effect on our business and results of operations if casino gaming were to be approved in texas 

eastern  mountaineer presque isle downs and scioto downs primarily compete with gaming facilities located in west virginia ohio and pennsylvania including to a certain extent each other and gaming locations located in neighboring states including new york indiana and michigan in particular mountaineer and to a lesser extent presque isle downs competes with other gaming facilities located in pennsylvania 

 

mountaineer competes with smaller gaming operations conducted in local bars and fraternal organizations west virginia law permits limited video lottery machines “lvls” in local bars and fraternal organizations the west virginia lottery commission authorizes up to 7500 slot machines in these facilities throughout west virginia no more than five slot machines are allowed in each establishment licensed to sell alcoholic beverages and no more than ten slot machines are allowed in each li censed fraternal organization as of december 31 2016 there were a total of approximately 1000 lvl’s in bars and fraternal organizations in hancock county west virginia where mountaineer is located and the two neighboring counties brooke and ohio co unties although the bars and fraternal organizations housing these machines lack poker and table gaming as well as the amenities and ambiance of our mountaineer facility they do compete with mountaineer particularly for the local patronage while ther e are three other tracks and one resort in west virginia that offer slot machine and table gaming only one wheeling island casino lies within mountaineer’s market 

scioto downs competes with one other property in the columbus ohio market hollywood casino which offers both vlts and table games

mountaineer’s and to a lesser extent presque isle downs’ racing and pari‑mutuel operations compete directly for wagering dollars with racing and pari‑mutuel operations at a variety of other horse and greyhound racetracks that conduct pari‑mutuel gaming mountaineer competes with racetracks across the country to have its signal carried by off‑track wagering parlors mountaineer presque isle downs and scioto downs also competes for wagering dollars with off‑track wagering facilities in ohio and pennsylvania and competes with other racetracks for participation by quality racehorses

general  all of our gaming operations also compete to a lesser extent with operations in other locations including native american lands and with other forms of legalized gaming in the united states including state‑sponsored lotteries on‑ and off‑track wagering high‑stakes bingo card parlors and internet gaming in addition casinos in canada have likewise recently begun advertising and increasing promotional activities in our target markets see “item 1a risk factors—risks related to our business— we face substantial competition in the hotel and casino industry and expect that such competition will continue ” which is included elsewhere in this report

regulations adopted by the financial crimes enforcement network of the treasury department “fincen” and the nevada gaming authorities require the reporting of currency transactions in excess of 10000 occurring within a gaming day including identification of the patron by name and social security number this reporting obligation began in may 1985 and may have resulted in the loss of gaming revenues to jurisdictions outside the united states which are exempt from the ambit of these regulations in addition to currency transaction reporting requirements suspicious financial activity is also required to be reported to fincen

 item 1a risk factors

risk factors relating to our operations

our business is sensitive to reductions in discretionary consumer spending as a result of downturns in the economy and other factors outside our control

consumer demand for casino hotel and racetrack properties such as ours is particularly sensitive to downturns in the economy and the associated impact on discretionary spending on leisure activities changes in discretionary consumer spending or consumer preferences brought about by factors such as perceived or actual general economic conditions effects of declines in consumer confidence in the economy including the recent housing employment and credit crisis the impact of high energy and food costs the increased cost of travel the potential for continued bank failures decreased disposable consumer income and wealth or fears of war and future acts of terrorism could further reduce customer demand for the amenities that we offer which have had a negative impact on our results of operations in the past and could negatively impact our results of operations in the future increases in gasoline prices including increases prompted by global political and economic instabilities can adversely affect our operations because most of our patrons travel to our properties by car or on airlines that may pass on increases in fuel costs to passengers in the form of higher ticket prices in addition security concerns terrorist attacks and other geopolitical events can have a material adverse effect on leisure and business travel discretionary spending and other areas of economic behavior that directly impact the gaming and entertainment industries in general and our business in particular economic downturns geopolitical events and other related factors which impact discretionary consumer spending and other economic activities have had direct effects on our business and the tourism industry in the past we cannot be sure how these factors will impact our operations in the future or the extent of the impact

we face substantial competition in the hotel and casino industry and expect that such competition will continue

the gaming industry is characterized by an increasingly high degree of competition among a large number of participants including land‑based casinos dockside casinos riverboat casinos casinos located on racing tracks and casinos located on native american reservations and other forms of legalized gaming we also compete to a lesser extent with other forms of legalized gaming and entertainment such as online computer gambling bingo pull tab games card parlors sports books fantasy sports websites “cruisetonowhere” operations parimutuel or telephonic betting on horse racing and dog racing statesponsored lotteries jaialai and in the future may compete with gaming at other venues in addition we compete more generally with other forms of entertainment for the discretionary spending of our customers

 

certain states have legalized casino gaming and other states may legalize gaming in the future legalized casino gaming in these sta tes and on native american reservations near our markets or changes to gaming laws in states surrounding our operations could increase competition and could adversely affect our operations there has been significant competition in our markets as a result of the expansion of facilities by existing market participants the entrance of new gaming participants into a market or legislative changes in prior years for example casino gaming is currently prohibited in several jurisdictions from which the shrevepo rtbossier city market draws customers primarily texas the texas legislature has from time to time considered proposals to legalize gaming and there can be no assurance that casino gaming will not be approved in texas in the future which could have a m aterial adverse effect on eldorado shreveport additionally since visitors from california comprise a significant portion of our customer base in reno we also compete with native american gaming operations in california native american tribes are allowe d to operate slot machines lottery games and banking and percentage games on native american lands although many existing native american gaming facilities in northern california are modest compared to the nevada properties a number of native american t ribes have established large ‑scale gaming facilities in california in addition various forms of internet gaming have been approved in nevada new jersey and delaware and legislation permitting internet gaming has been proposed by the federal government and other states the expansion of internet gaming in nevada and other jurisdictions could result in significant additional competition 

gaming competition is intense in most of the markets in which we operate there has been significant competition in our markets as a result of the expansion of facilities by existing market participants the entrance of new gaming participants into a market or legislative changes in prior years for example casino gaming is currently prohibited in several jurisdictions from which the shreveportbossier city market draws customers primarily texas the texas legislature has from time to time considered proposals to legalize gaming and there can be no assurance that casino gaming will not be approved in texas in the future which may have a negative effect on our business additionally since visitors from california comprise a significant portion of our customer base in reno we also compete with native american gaming operations in california native american tribes are allowed to operate slot machines lottery games and banking and percentage games on native american lands although many existing native american gaming facilities in northern california are modest compared to the nevada properties a number of native american tribes have established large‑scale gaming facilities in california an additional license has been granted for a casino to be located in lawrence county pennsylvania approximately 45 miles from mountaineer and 90 miles from presque isle downs which would result in further competition for both of those properties further gaming facilities in ohio that commenced operations in recent years present significant competition for mountaineer presque isle downs and scioto downs

increased competition may require us to make substantial capital expenditures to maintain and enhance the competitive positions of our properties to increase the attractiveness and add to the appeal of our facilities because we are highly leveraged after satisfying our obligations under our outstanding indebtedness there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient funds to undertake these expenditures or that we will be able to obtain sufficient financing to fund such expenditures if we are unable to make such expenditures our competitive position could be negatively affected

we are subject to extensive state and local regulation and licensing and gaming authorities have significant control over our operations which could have an adverse effect on our business

licensing requirements  the ownership and operation of casino gaming riverboat and horseracing facilities are subject to extensive federal state and local regulation and regulatory authorities at the federal state and local levels have broad powers with respect to the licensing of gaming businesses and may revoke suspend condition or limit our gaming or other licenses impose substantial fines and take other actions each of which poses a significant risk to our business financial condition and results of operations we currently hold all state and local licenses and related approvals necessary to conduct our present gaming operations but we must periodically apply to renew many of our licenses and registrations we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such renewals any failure to maintain or renew our existing licenses registrations permits or approvals would have a material adverse effect on us furthermore if additional laws or regulations are adopted or existing laws or regulations are amended these regulations could impose additional restrictions or costs that could have a significant adverse effect on us as an example on august 26 2014 the board of health of hancock county west virginia adopted and approved the clean air regulation act of 2014 “regulation” which became effective july 1 2015 the regulation bans smoking in public places in hancock county including at mountaineer to comply with the regulation upon its effective date mountaineer built a 9300 square foot smoking pavilion which opened on july 1 2015 and currently houses 322 slot machines and four table games notwithstanding our efforts to mitigate the impact of the smoking ban the regulation has had a negative impact on our business and results of operations at mountaineer we expect that the regulation will continue to and any similar regulations enacted in the future may negatively impact our business and results of operations and such impact would be material 

 

gaming authorities with jurisdiction over our operations may in their discretion require the holder of any securities issued by us to file applications be investigated and be found suitable to own our securities if they have reason to believe that the security ownership would be inconsistent with the declared policies of their respective jurisdictions further the costs of any investigation conducted by any of the gaming authorities under these circumstances must be paid by the applicant and refusal or failure to pay these charges may constitute grounds for a finding that the applicant is unsuitable to own the securities if any of the gaming authorities determines that a person is unsuitable to own our securities then under the applicable gaming or horse racing laws and regulations we can be s anctioned including the loss of approvals that are required for us to continue our gaming operations in the relevant jurisdictions if such unsuitable person does not timely sell our securities 

our officers directors and key employees are also subject to a variety of regulatory requirements and various licensing and related approval procedures in the various jurisdictions in which we operate gaming facilities if any of the applicable gaming authorities were to find an officer director or key employee of ours unsuitable for licensing or unsuitable to continue having a relationship with us we would have to sever all relationships with that person furthermore the gaming authorities may require us to terminate the employment of any person who refuses to file appropriate applications either result could materially adversely affect our gaming operations

applicable gaming laws and regulations restrict our ability to issue securities incur debt and undertake other financing activities such transactions would generally require approval of applicable gaming authorities and our financing counterparties including lenders might be subject to various licensing and related approval procedures in the various jurisdictions in which we operate gaming facilities if state regulatory authorities were to find any person unsuitable with regard to his her or its relationship to us or any of our subsidiaries we would be required to sever our relationships with that person which could materially adversely affect our business

compliance with other laws  we are also subject to a variety of other federal state and local laws rules regulations and ordinances that apply to nongaming businesses including zoning environmental construction and landuse laws and regulations governing the serving of alcoholic beverages under various federal state and local laws and regulations an owner or operator of real property may be held liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances or wastes located on its property regardless of whether or not the present owner or operator knows of or is responsible for the presence of such substances or wastes we have not identified any issues associated with our properties that could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on us or the results of our operations however several of our properties are located in industrial areas or were used for industrial purposes for many years as a consequence it is possible that historical or neighboring activities have affected one or more of our properties and that as a result environmental issues could arise in the future the precise nature of which we cannot now predict the coverage and attendant compliance costs associated with these laws regulations and ordinances may result in future additional costs 

regulations adopted by fincen require us to report currency transactions in excess of 10000 occurring within a gaming day including identification of the patron by name and social security number us treasury department regulations also require us to report certain suspicious activity including any transaction that exceeds 5000 if we know suspect or have reason to believe that the transaction involves funds from illegal activity or is designed to evade federal regulations or reporting requirements substantial penalties can be imposed if we fail to comply with these regulations fincen has recently increased its focus on gaming companies

we are required to report certain customer’s gambling winnings via form w2g to comply with current internal revenue service regulations should these regulations change we would expect to incur additional costs to comply with the revised reporting requirements 

a new rule implemented by the us department of labor “dol” which was expected to become effective december 1 2016 provides that certain exempt salaried employees making below 47476 annually will be eligible for overtime we expect to incur additional costs associated with complying with this revised rule in november 2016 a us district court of the eastern district of texas issued a preliminary injunction enjoining the implementation of the dol rule

 

taxation and fees  in addition gaming companies are generally subject to si gnificant revenuebased taxes and fees in addition to normal federal state and local income taxes and such taxes and fees are subject to increase at any time we pay substantial taxes and fees with respect to our operations from time to time federal state and local legislators and officials have proposed changes in tax laws or in the administration of such laws affecting the gaming industry in addition worsening economic conditions could intensify the efforts of state and local governments to rai se revenues through increases in gaming taxes andor property taxes it is not possible to determine with certainty the likelihood of changes in tax laws or in the administration of such laws such changes if adopted could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations the large number of state and local governments with significant current or projected budget deficits makes it more likely that those governments that currently permit gaming will seek to fund such deficits with new or increased gaming taxes andor property taxes and worsening economic conditions could intensify those efforts any material increase or the adoption of additional taxes or fees could have a material adverse effect on our future financial results 

we rely on our key personnel and we may face difficulties in attracting and retaining qualified employees for our casinos and race tracks

our future success will depend upon among other things our ability to keep our senior executives and highly qualified employees we compete with other potential employers for employees and we may not succeed in hiring or retaining the executives and other employees that we need a sudden loss of or inability to replace key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operation

in addition the operation of our business requires qualified executives managers and skilled employees with gaming and horse racing industry experience and qualifications who are able to obtain the requisite licenses and approval from the applicable gaming authorities while not currently the case there has from time to time been a shortage of skilled labor in our markets in addition to limitations that may otherwise exist in the supply of skilled labor the continued expansion of gaming near our facilities including the expansion of native american gaming may make it more difficult for us to attract qualified individuals while we believe that we will continue to be able to attract and retain qualified employees shortages of skilled labor will make it increasingly difficult and expensive to attract and retain the services of a satisfactory number of qualified employees and we may incur higher costs than expected as a result

our operations in certain jurisdictions depend on agreements with third parties

our operations in several jurisdictions depend on agreements with third parties if we are unable to renew these agreements on satisfactory terms as they expire our business may be disrupted and in the event of disruptions in multiple jurisdictions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations

for example the federal interstate horse racing act and the state racing laws in west virginia ohio and pennsylvania require that in order to simulcast races we have written agreements with the horse owners and trainers at those racetracks in addition in order to operate slot machines in west virginia we are required to enter into written agreements regarding the proceeds of the slot machines a “proceeds agreement” with a representative of a majority of the horse owners and trainers and with a representative of a majority of the pari‑mutuel clerks

if we fail to maintain operative agreements with the horsemen at any of our racetracks we will not be permitted to conduct live racing and export and import simulcasting at the applicable racetrack in addition if we fail to maintain operative agreements with the horsemen at mountaineer presque isle downs and scioto downs including if we do not have in place the legally required proceeds agreement with the mountaineer pari‑mutuel clerks union we will not be permitted to continue our gaming operations at those facilities if we fail to renew or modify existing agreements on satisfactory terms this failure could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

work stoppages organizing drives and other labor problems could negatively impact our future profits

some of our employees are currently represented by labor unions a lengthy strike or other work stoppages at any of our casino properties could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations given the large number of employees labor unions are making a concerted effort to recruit more employees in the gaming industry in addition organized labor may benefit from new legislation or legal interpretations by the current presidential administration particularly in light of current support for changes to federal and state labor laws we cannot provide any assurance that we will not experience additional and more successful union organization activity in the future

 

because portions of the land on which our facilitie s are situated are leased the termination of such leases could adversely affect our business 

we lease certain parcels of land on which several of our properties are located including a portion of the parcel on which eldorado reno is located the land on which eldorado shreveport is built and a portion of the property on which circus reno is located as a ground lessee we have the right to use the leased land however we do not hold fee ownership in the underlying land accordingly with respect to the leased land we will have no interest in the land or improvements thereon at the expiration of the ground leases moreover since we do not completely control the land underlying the property a landowner could take certain actions to disrupt our rights in the land leased under the longterm leases which are beyond our control if the entity owning any leased land chose to disrupt our use either permanently or for a significant period of time then the value of our assets could be impaired and our business and operations could be adversely affected if we were to default on any one or more of these leases the applicable lessors could terminate the affected leases and we could lose possession of the affected land and any improvements on the land including the hotels and casinos this would have a significant adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations as we would then be unable to operate all or portions of the affected facilities and may result in the default under the agreements governing our indebtedness

because we own real property we will be subject to extensive environmental regulation which creates uncertainty regarding future environmental expenditures and liabilities

we are subject to various federal state and local environmental health and safety laws and regulations that govern activities that may have adverse environmental effects such as discharges to air and water as well as the use storage discharge emission and disposal of solid animal and hazardous wastes and exposure to hazardous materials these laws and regulations are complex and frequently subject to change in addition our horseracing facilities are subject to laws and regulations that address the impacts of manure and wastewater generated by concentrated animal feeding operations “cafo” on water quality including but not limited to storm water discharges cafo regulations include permit requirements and water quality discharge standards enforcement of cafo regulations has been receiving increased governmental attention compliance with these and other environmental laws can in some circumstances require significant capital expenditures we have from time to time been responsible for investigating and remediating or contributing to remediation costs related to contamination located at or near certain of our facilities including contamination related to underground storage tanks and groundwater contamination arising from prior uses of land on which certain of our facilities are located in addition we have been and may in the future be required to manage abate remove or contain manure and wastewater generated by concentrated animal feeding operations due to our racetrack operations mold lead asbestos‑containing materials or other hazardous conditions found in or on our properties moreover violations can result in significant fines or penalties and in some instances interruption or cessation of operations

we are also subject to laws and regulations that create liability and cleanup responsibility for releases of regulated materials into the environment certain of these laws and regulations impose strict and under certain circumstances joint and several liability on a current or previous owner or operator of property for the costs of remediating regulated materials on or emanating from its property the costs of investigation remediation or removal of those substances may be substantial

 

an earthquake flood other natural disaster or act of terrorism could adversely affect ou r business 

although we maintain insurance that is customary and appropriate for our business each of our insurance policies is subject to certain exclusions in addition in some cases our property insurance coverage is combined among certain of our properties or is otherwise in an amount that may be significantly less than the expected replacement cost of rebuilding our facilities in the event of a total loss such losses may occur as a result of any number of casualty events including as a result of earthquakes floods hurricanes or other severe weather conditions in particular the reno area has been and may in the future be subject to earthquakes and other natural disasters and eldorado shreveport is located in a designated flood zone inadequate insurance or lack of available insurance for these and other certain types or levels of risk could expose us to significant losses in the event that a catastrophe occurred for which we are underinsured in addition to the damage caused to our properties by a casualty loss we may suffer business disruption as a result of the casualty event or be subject to claims by third parties that may be injured or harmed while we carry general liability insurance and business interruption insurance there can be no assurance that insurance will be available or adequate to cover all loss and damage to which our business or our assets might be subjected in addition certain casualty events such as labor strikes nuclear events loss of income due to terrorism deterioration or corrosion insect or animal damage and pollution may not be covered under our policies any losses we incur that are not adequately covered by insurance may decrease our future operating income require us to fund replacements or repairs for destroyed property and reduce the funds available for payments of our obligations further we renew our insurance policies on an annual basis the cost of coverage may become so high that we may need to further reduce our policy limits or agree to certain exclusions from coverage among other factors it is possible that regional political tensions homeland security concerns other catastrophic events or any change in government legislation governing insurance coverage for acts of terrorism could materially adversely affect available insurance coverage and result in increased premiums on available coverage which may cause us to elect to reduce its policy limits additional exclusions from coverage or higher deductibles among other potential future adverse changes in the future we may elect to not or may not be able to obtain any coverage for losses due to acts of terrorism

we are subject to risks relating to mechanical failure forces of nature casualty extraordinary maintenance and other causes

all of our facilities will generally be subject to the risk that operations could be halted for a temporary or extended period of time as the result of casualty forces of nature mechanical failure or extended or extraordinary maintenance among other causes in addition our gaming operations could be damaged or halted due to extreme weather conditions these risks are particularly pronounced at eldorado shreveport’s riverboat and dockside facilities because of their location on and adjacent to water

we are or may become involved in legal proceedings that if adversely adjudicated or settled could impact our business and financial condition

from time to time we are named in lawsuits or other legal proceedings relating to our respective businesses in particular the nature of our business subjects us to the risk of lawsuits filed by customers past and present employees competitors business partners and others in the ordinary course of business as with all legal proceedings no assurances can be given as to the outcome of these matters moreover legal proceedings can be expensive and time consuming and we may not be successful in defending or prosecuting these lawsuits which could result in settlements or damages that could significantly impact our business financial condition and results of operations

our information technology and other systems are subject to cyber security risk including misappropriation of customer information or other breaches of information security

our operations require that we collect customer data including credit card numbers and other personally identifiable information for various business purposes including marketing and promotional purposes the collection and use of personal data are governed by privacy laws and regulations enacted in the united states and other jurisdictions around the world privacy regulations continue to evolve and on occasion may be inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another our information and processes are subject to the everchanging threat of compromised security in the form of a risk of potential breach system failure computer virus or unauthorized or fraudulent use by customers company employees or employees of thirdparty vendors the steps we take to deter and mitigate these risks may not be successful and any resulting compromise or loss of data or systems could adversely impact operations or regulatory compliance and could result in remedial expenses fines litigation and loss of reputation potentially impacting our financial results 

 

in addition thirdparty service providers and other business partners process and maintain proprietary business information and data related to our guests suppliers and other business partners our information technology and other systems that m aintain and transmit this information or those of service providers or business partners may also be compromised by a malicious thirdparty penetration of its network security or that of a thirdparty service provider or business partner or impacted by intentional or unintentional actions or inactions by its employees or those of a thirdparty service provider or business partner as a result our business information guest supplier and other business partner data may be lost disclosed accessed or t aken without their consent 

any such loss disclosure or misappropriation of or access to guests or business partners’ information or other breach of our information security can result in legal claims or legal proceedings including regulatory investigations and actions may have a serious impact on our reputation and may adversely affect its businesses operating results and financial condition furthermore the loss disclosure or misappropriation of our business information may adversely affect our reputation businesses operating results and financial condition

our operations have historically been subject to seasonal variations and quarterly fluctuations in operating results and we can expect to experience such variations and fluctuations in the future

historically our operations have typically been subject to seasonal variations our strongest operating results for our reno properties have generally occurred in the second and third quarters and the weakest results have generally occurred during the period from november through february when weather conditions adversely affected operating results winter conditions can frequently adversely affect transportation routes to reno where approximately two‑thirds of our visitors arrive by ground transportation and certain of our other properties and cause cancellations of live horse racing in particular since january 1 2017 the renotahoe area has experienced exceptionally high levels of snowfall in the first quarter of 2017 with certain resorts in the tahoe area reporting over 50 feet of snowfall during such time which has adversely affected visitation to our reno properties and may adversely affect our results of operations for the first quarter as a result unfavorable seasonal conditions could have a material adverse effect on our operations

because we will be heavily dependent upon hotelcasino and related operations that are conducted in certain limited regions we will be subject to greater risks than a company that is geographically or otherwise more diversified

our business is heavily dependent upon hotelcasino and related operations that are conducted in three discrete markets as a result we are still subject to a greater degree of risk than a gaming company that has greater geographical diversity the risks to which we have a greater degree of exposure include the following













any of the factors outlined above could adversely affect our ability to generate sufficient cash flow to make payments on our outstanding indebtedness

significant negative industry or economic trends reduced estimates of future cash flows disruptions to our business slower growth rates or lack of growth in our business may cause us to incur impairments to indefinitelived intangible assets or long‑lived assets

we test indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually or if a triggering event occurs we will also be required to consider whether the fair values of any of our investments accounted for under the equity method have declined below their carrying value whenever adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate that recorded values may not be recoverable estimated fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis based on estimated future results of the investee and market indicators of the terminal year capitalization rate if any such declines are considered to be other than temporary we will be required to record a write‑down to estimated fair value

 

the concentration and evolution of the slot machine manufacturing industry could impose additional costs on us 

there are a limited number of slot machine manufacturers servicing the gaming industry and a large majority of our revenues are derived from slot machines at our casinos it is important for competitive reasons that we offer the most popular and uptodate slot machine games with the latest technology to customers 

in recent years slot machine manufacturers have frequently refused to sell slot machines featuring the most popular games instead requiring participating lease arrangements generally a participating lease is substantially more expensive over the longterm than the cost to purchase a new slot machine 

for competitive reasons we may be forced to purchase new slot machines slot machine systems or enter into participating lease arrangements that are more expensive than our current costs associated with the continued operation of its existing slot machines if the newer slot machines do not result in sufficient incremental revenues to offset the increased investment and participating lease costs it could adversely affect profitability 

we materially rely on a variety of hardware and software products to maximize revenue and efficiency in our operations technology in the gaming industry is developing rapidly and we may need to invest substantial amounts to acquire the most current gaming and hotel technology and equipment in order to remain competitive in the markets in which we operate ensuring the successful implementation and maintenance of any new technology acquired is an additional risk

we may experience construction delays or cost overruns during its expansion or development projects that could adversely affect our operations

from time to time we may commence construction projects on new properties or at our current properties we also evaluate other expansion opportunities as they become available and may in the future engage in additional construction projects the anticipated costs and construction periods for construction projects are based upon budgets conceptual design documents and construction schedule estimates prepared by us in consultation with its architects construction projects entail significant risks which can substantially increase costs or delay completion of a project such risks include shortages of materials or skilled labor unforeseen engineering environmental or geological problems work stoppages weather interference and unanticipated cost increases most of these factors are beyond our control in addition difficulties or delays in obtaining any of the requisite licenses permits or authorizations from regulatory authorities can increase the cost or delay the completion of an expansion or development significant budget overruns or delays with respect to expansion and development projects could adversely affect our results of operations

risk factors relating to the isle of capri acquisition

the merger agreement subjects the company to restrictions on its business activities during the pendency of the mergers

the merger agreement subjects the company to restrictions on its business activities and obligates the company to generally operate its businesses in the ordinary course in all material respects during the pendency of the mergers these restrictions could prevent the company from pursuing attractive business opportunities that arise prior to the completion of the mergers and are outside the ordinary course of business and could otherwise have an adverse effect on eri’s and isle’s results of operations cash flows and financial position

delay or failure to complete the mergers would prevent the company from realizing the anticipated benefits of the mergers and each company would also remain liable for significant transaction costs including legal accounting and financial advisory fees

any delay in completing the mergers may reduce the synergies and other benefits anticipated by the company if it successfully completes the mergers within the expected timeframe and integrates the businesses of the company and isle in addition the market price of each company’s common stock may reflect various market assumptions as to whether and when the mergers will be completed consequently the completion of the failure to complete or any delay in the completion of the mergers could result in significant changes in the market price of the company’s common stock in addition the company has incurred and will continue to incur significant costs relating to the mergers such as legal accounting financial advisor and printing fees that will be required to be paid whether or not the mergers are consummated further the company may be required to pay a termination fee depending on the circumstances surrounding the termination

 

whether or not the mergers are completed the pendency of the transaction could cause disr uptions in the businesses of the company which could have an adverse effect on its businesses and financial results 

these disruptions could include the following







obtaining required approvals and satisfying closing conditions may delay or prevent completion of the mergers and may significantly reduce the benefits anticipated to be realized from the mergers or could adversely affect the market price of the company or its future business and financial results

completion of the mergers is subject to various closing conditions including a isle’s stockholders adopting the merger agreement b eri’s stockholders approving the issuance of eri shares as consideration in the mergers c the approval or expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period under the hsr act d obtaining certain gaming approvals to the standards set forth in the merger agreement and e each of isle and eri’s receipt of a tax opinion to the effect that the mergers will be treated as a “reorganization” within the meaning of section 368a of the code if such conditions are not satisfied the mergers will not be consummated unless such conditions are validly waived such conditions may jeopardize or delay completion of the mergers or may reduce the anticipated benefits of the mergers further no assurance can be given that the required consents and approvals will be obtained or that the required conditions to closing will be satisfied even if all such consents and approvals are obtained no assurance can be given as to the terms conditions and timing of the consents and approvals or that they will satisfy the terms of the merger agreement on october 21 2016 the waiting period under the hsr act was terminated early by the federal trade commission the company and isle of capri received approval adopting the merger agreement of each of their respective stockholders on january 25 2017 at separate special meetings of stockholders

the mergers are subject to the receipt of approvals consents or clearances that may impose conditions that could have an adverse effect on eri or if not obtained could prevent completion of the transactions

completion of the mergers is conditioned upon the receipt of certain governmental approvals including without limitation antitrust and gaming regulatory approvals although each party has agreed to use its respective reasonable best efforts to obtain the requisite governmental approvals there can be no assurance that these approvals will be obtained and that the other conditions to completing the mergers will be satisfied in addition the governmental authorities from which the regulatory approvals are required may impose conditions on the completion of the mergers or require changes to the terms of the merger agreement or other agreements to be entered into in connection with the merger agreement such conditions or changes and the process of obtaining regulatory approvals could have the effect of delaying or impeding consummation of the mergers or of imposing additional costs or limitations on eri or isle following completion of the mergers any of which might have an adverse effect on eri or isle

gaming regulatory approvals may not be received may take longer than expected or may impose conditions that are not presently anticipated or cannot be met

eri and isle must obtain approval of the mergers which approvals must be duly obtained without the imposition of material restrictions or conditions and be in full force and effect from a variety of gaming regulatory authorities these approvals may not be received at all may not be received in a timely fashion andor may contain conditions on the completion of the mergers in addition these regulatory bodies may impose conditions on the granting of such approvals such conditions and the process of obtaining regulatory approvals could have the effect of delaying completion of the mergers or of imposing additional costs or limitations on eri following the mergers

 

if the financing contemplated by the commitment letter is not available or alternative financing cannot be secured the mergers may not be completed and eri may be required to pay a termination fee to isle 

eri intends to finance the cash required in connection with the mergers including expenses in connection with the mergers with debt financing in accordance with the terms of the commitment letter the commitment letter provides for a a senior secured credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of 175 billion comprised of i a term loan facility of up to 145 billion and ii a revolving credit facility of 3000 million and b an amount equal to at least 3750 million in gross proceeds from the issuance and sale by eri of senior unsecured notes or if the notes are not issued and sold on or prior to the date of the consummation of the mergers an amount equal to at least 3750 million in senior unsecured bridge loans under a senior unsecured credit facility in the event some or all of the financing contemplated by the commitment letter is not available eri is obligated to use its reasonable best efforts to obtain alternative financing from alternative institutions in an amount sufficient to enable eri to consummate the mergers refinance the outstanding indebtedness of isle described in the prior paragraph and pay all fees and expenses of isle in connection with the mergers and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement if financing cannot be obtained the mergers may not be completed if eri is unable to obtain funding from its financing sources for the cash required in connection with the mergers and isle is otherwise ready willing and able to close the mergers eri may be liable to isle for a financing failure fee of 600 million or may be compelled to specifically perform its obligations to consummate the transaction

litigation challenging the mergers could delay or prevent the completion of the mergers

one of the conditions to the mergers is that no temporary restraining order preliminary or permanent injunction or other judgment order or decree issued by any court of competent jurisdiction or other legal restraint or prohibition preventing the consummation of the mergers will be in effect nor will there be any law statute ordinance rule regulation order policy guideline or agency requirement enacted entered promulgated enforced or deemed applicable by any governmental entity that prohibits or makes illegal the consummation of the mergers in connection with the mergers two class action lawsuits were filed by purported eri stockholders alleging breach of fiduciary duty by the eri board of directors in connection with the mergers one of which was dismissed the pending lawsuit alleges among other things breach of fiduciary duty in failing to disclose all material information to eri stockholders in seeking approval of the issuance of eri shares in the mergers and requests injunctive relief and an award of costs incurred by the plaintiffs in the actions there can be no assurance that additional claims will not be filed by stockholders of eri or isle seeking damages relating to or otherwise challenging the mergers if the plaintiffs in any such action secure injunctive or other relief prohibiting delaying or otherwise adversely affecting eri’s and isle’s ability to consummate the mergers then such injunctive or other relief may prevent the mergers from becoming effective within the expected time frame or at all if consummation of the mergers is prevented or delayed it could result in substantial costs to eri and isle in addition eri and isle could incur significant costs in connection with such lawsuits including costs associated with the indemnification of eri and isle’s directors and officers

the integration of eri and isle following the mergers may present significant challenges and impair eri’s ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the mergers in the anticipated time frame or at all

eri’s ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the mergers will depend to a large extent on eri’s ability to integrate isle’s business into eri in the anticipated time frame or at all eri may face significant challenges in combining isle’s operations into its operations in a timely and efficient manner the combination of two independent businesses is a complex costly and timeconsuming process as a result eri will be required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating the business practices and operations of isle into those of eri the integration process may disrupt the business and if implemented ineffectively or inefficiently would preclude realization of the full benefits expected by eri and isle the failure to successfully integrate isle into eri and to manage the challenges presented by the integration process successfully may result in an interruption of or loss of momentum in the business of eri or isle which may have the effect of depressing the market price of eri common stock following the effective time as defined in the merger agreement

eri may be unable to realize anticipated cost synergies or may incur additional costs

eri expects to realize cost synergies from combining the sales and general and administrative functions of isle and eri however eri will be required to incur costs including severance and related expenses to realize the anticipated cost savings while eri’s management believes the combined entity will benefit from cost synergies eri may be unable to realize all of these cost synergies within the time frame expected or at all in addition eri may incur additional or unexpected costs in order to realize these cost synergies

 

the mergers may not be accretive and may cause dilution to the combined company’s earnings per share which may negatively affect the price of the common stock of the combined company following completion of the mergers 

eri currently anticipates that the mergers will be accretive to the earnings per share of the combined company in 2017 this expectation is based on preliminary estimates and assumes certain synergies expected to be realized by the combined company over a 12month period following the completion of the mergers and the previously announced dispositions of isle of capri casino hotel lake charles and lady luck casino marquette such estimates and assumptions could materially change due to additional transactionrelated costs delays in regulatory approvals the failure to realize any or all of the benefits expected in the mergers or other factors beyond the control of eri all of these factors could delay decrease or eliminate the expected accretive effect of the mergers and cause resulting dilution to the combined company’s earnings per share or to the price of the common stock of the combined company

unanticipated costs relating to the mergers could reduce eri’s future earnings per share 

we believe that we have reasonably estimated the likely incremental costs of the combined operations of eri and isle following the mergers however it is possible that unexpected transaction costs such as taxes fees or professional expenses or unexpected future operating expenses such as unanticipated costs to integrate the two businesses increased personnel costs or increased taxes as well as other types of unanticipated adverse developments could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations and financial condition of eri following the mergers in addition if actual costs are materially different than expected costs the mergers could have a significant dilutive effect on eri’s earnings per share

eri will have a substantial amount of debt outstanding following the mergers

eri expects that it will have approximately 22 billion of debt outstanding following the completion of the mergers and related transactions in addition eri expects that it will have the ability to incur additional debt under its 3000 million revolving credit facility and may be required to incur additional indebtedness to finance the cash portion of the merger consideration if the sale of isle of capri casino hotel lake charles andor the sale of lady luck casino marquette is not consummated prior to the closing of the mergers as a result of the increased levels of outstanding indebtedness following the mergers future interest expense and debt service obligations will be significantly higher than historic interest expense and the risks associated with its outstanding indebtedness will be intensified delay or failure to consummate the sale of the isle of capri casino hotel lake charles or the lady luck casino marquette may require eri to incur additional debt to repay outstanding indebtedness of isle or otherwise adversely impact the financial condition of the combined company

on august 22 2016 isle entered into an agreement to sell isle of capri casino hotel lake charles for aggregate consideration of 1345 million subject to certain adjustments on october 13 2016 isle entered into an agreement to sell lady luck casino marquette for cash consideration of approximately 400 million subject to certain adjustments the consummation of each transaction is subject to satisfaction of customary conditions including receipt of regulatory approval the accuracy of the representations and warranties compliance with covenants delivery of certain closing deliverables and the absence of any governmental order or action seeking to prohibit the consummation of the transaction although isle expects the sale of isle of capri casino hotel lake charles to be consummated in isle’s early fiscal 2018 there can be no assurance as to the timing of the closing of either sale or that the closings will occur on the terms set forth in the purchase agreements relating to the sales or at all in the event that the closing of either sale is delayed or does not occur eri may be required to incur additional indebtedness to repay debt outstanding under isle’s credit agreement or outstanding notes which could adversely impact the financial condition of the combined company

 

risks related to eri’s capital structure and equity ownership 

we have significant indebtedness

as of december 31 2016 we and our restricted subsidiaries had 8226 million of total indebtedness outstanding consisting of 3750 million in aggregate principal amount of outstanding 70 senior notes due 2023 “senior notes” our 4250 million term loan the “term loan” and amounts outstanding under our 1500 million revolving credit facility the “revolving credit facility” and together with the term loan the “credit facility” we expect to incur approximately 18 billion of additional debt in order to complete the mergers and related transactions in addition as of december 31 2016 we had the ability to incur approximately 1210 million of additional debt under our revolving credit facility and we expect that we will have the ability to incur additional debt under the 3000 million revolving credit facility that we expect to enter into in connection with the mergers further we may be required to incur additional indebtedness to finance the cash portion of the merger consideration if the sale of isle of capri casino hotel lake charles andor the sale of lady luck casino marquette is not consummated prior to the closing of the mergers this indebtedness may have important negative consequences for us including

























we and our subsidiaries expect to incur substantial additional indebtedness in connection with the isle acquisition and may incur significant indebtedness in addition to the debt that we expect to incur in connection with the isle acquisition incurring more indebtedness could increase the risks associated with our substantial indebtedness

we and our subsidiaries may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future as of december 31 2016 we had 1210 million of borrowing availability under our credit facility and we had commitments for 175 billion of additional indebtedness that we expect to incur in connection with the isle acquisition our existing debt agreements currently permit and we expect that agreements governing debt that we incur in the future will permit us to incur certain other additional secured and unsecured debt further we may incur other liabilities that do not constitute indebtedness the risks that we face based on our outstanding indebtedness may intensify if we incur additional indebtedness in the future including as a result of the consummation of the isle acquisition

 

we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness which may not be successful 

our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial business legislative regulatory and other factors beyond our control we cannot assure you that we will maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal premium if any and interest on our indebtedness

if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to sell assets seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness these alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations if our operating results and available cash are insufficient to meet our debt service obligations we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations we may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain the proceeds that we could realize from them and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due additionally the agreements governing our existing debt limit and the agreements governing debt that we incur in the future including debt incurred in connection with the isle acquisition are expected to limit the use of the proceeds from any disposition as a result we may not be allowed under these documents to use proceeds from such dispositions to satisfy all current debt service obligations

the agreements governing our debt impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries which may prevent us from capitalizing on business opportunities

the agreements governing our existing debt impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and we expect that agreements governing debt that we incur in the future including debt incurred in connection with the isle acquisition are expected to impose similar restrictions these restrictions limit our ability among other things to

















in addition the credit agreement governing the credit facility contains certain financial covenants including minimum interest coverage ratio and maximum total leverage ratio covenants and we expect that the credit agreement that we enter into in connection with the isle acquisition will contain similar financial covenants

as a result of these covenants and restrictions we are limited in how we conduct our business and we may be unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities the restrictions caused by such covenants could also place us at a competitive disadvantage to less leveraged competitors

a failure to comply with the covenants contained in the agreements governing our existing or future indebtedness could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could result in the acceleration of the indebtedness and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations if our indebtedness were to be accelerated there can be no assurance that our assets would be sufficient to repay such indebtedness in full moreover in the event that such indebtedness is accelerated there can be no assurance that we will be able to refinance it on acceptable terms or at all

 

we are a holding company and will depend on our subsidiaries for dividends distributions and repayment of our indebtedness 

we are structured as a holding company a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries our only significant asset is the capital stock or other equity interests of our operating subsidiaries as a holding company we conduct all of our business through our subsidiaries consequently our principal source of cash flow will be dividends and distributions from our subsidiaries if our subsidiaries are unable to make dividend payments or distributions to us and sufficient cash or liquidity is not otherwise available we may not be able to pay interest or principal on our indebtedness

the market price of eri’s common stock could fluctuate significantly

the us securities markets in general have experienced significant price fluctuations in recent years the market price of eri’s common stock may be volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in addition the trading volume of eri’s common stock may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur some of the factors that could cause fluctuations in or have a material adverse effect on the stock price or trading volume of eri’s common stock include

























we cannot assure you that the stock price of eri common stock will not fluctuate or decline significantly in the future in addition the stock market in general can experience considerable price and volume fluctuations that may be unrelated to eri’s performance if the market price of eri common stock fluctuates significantly eri may become the subject of securities class action litigation which may result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources

eri has not historically paid dividends a and may not pay dividends in the future

eri does not currently expect to pay dividends on its common stock any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of the eri board of directors and will depend upon among other factors eri’s earnings cash requirements financial condition requirements to comply with the covenants under its debt instruments legal considerations and other factors that the eri board of directors deems relevant in addition the agreements governing eri’s indebtedness restrict its ability to pay dividends if eri does not pay dividends then the return on an investment in its common stock will depend entirely upon any future appreciation in its stock price there is no guarantee that eri’s common stock will appreciate in value or maintain its value

the following table summarizes our estimated contractual payment obligations as of december 31 2016

 



 













the table above excludes certain commitments as of december 31 2016 for which the timing of expenditures associated with such commitments is unknown or contractual agreements have not been executed or the guaranteed maximum price for such contractual agreements has not been agreed upon

the repayment of our long‑term debt which consists of indebtedness evidenced by the senior notes and the credit facility is subject to acceleration upon the occurrence of an event of default under the indentures governing these obligations

we routinely enter into operational contracts in the ordinary course of our business including construction contracts for minor projects that are not material to our business or financial condition as a whole our commitments relating to these contracts are recognized as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets when services are provided with respect to such contracts

off balance sheet arrangements

the company does not currently have any off balance sheet arrangements

 

inflation 

we do not believe that inflation has had a significant impact on our revenues results of operations or cash flows since inception

other liquidity matters

the pennsylvania gaming control board the “pgcb” the pennsylvania department of revenue and the pennsylvania state police collectively “the borrowers” were required to fund the costs they incurred in connection with the initial development of the infrastructure to support gaming operations in pennsylvania as well as the initial ongoing costs of the borrowers the initial funding of these costs was provided from a loan from the pennsylvania general fund in the amount of 361 million and further funding was provided from additional loans from the pennsylvania property tax reserve fund in the aggregate amount of 638 million

the pennsylvania department of revenue will assess all licensees including presque isle downs their proportionate share of amounts represented by the borrowings which are in the aggregate amount of 999 million once the designated number of pennsylvania’s slot machine licensees is operational on july 11 2011 the pgcb issued an administrative order which established that payments associated with the 638 million that was borrowed from the property tax reserve fund would commence on january 1 2012 the repayment allocation between all current licensees is based upon equal weighting of i cumulative gross slot revenue since inception in relation to the combined cumulative gross slot revenue for all licensees and ii single year gross slot revenue during the state’s fiscal year ending june 30 in relation to the combined single year gross slot revenue for all licensees and amounts paid each year will be adjusted annually based upon changes in the licensee’s proportionate share of gross slot revenue we have estimated that our total proportionate share of the aggregate 638 million to be assessed to the gaming facilities will be 41 million and will be paid quarterly over a ten‑year period which began effective january 1 2012 for the 361 million that was borrowed from the general fund payment is scheduled to begin after all fourteen licensees are operational although we cannot determine when payment will begin we have considered a similar repayment model for the general fund borrowings and estimated that our total proportionate share of the aggregate 361 million to all fourteen gaming facilities will be 19 million

the recorded estimate is subject to revision based upon future changes in the revenue assumptions utilized to develop the estimate our estimated total obligation at december 31 2016 is 37 million the company paid 04 million during the year ended december 31 2016

we are faced with certain contingencies involving litigation and environmental remediation and compliance these commitments and contingencies are discussed in greater detail in “part i item 3 legal proceedings” and note 16 to our consolidated financial statements both of which are included elsewhere in this report in addition new competition may have a material adverse effect on our revenues and could have a similar adverse effect on our liquidity see “part i item 1a risk factors—risks related to our business” which is included elsewhere in this report

critical accounting policies

our significant accounting policies are included in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements which are included elsewhere in this report these policies along with the underlying assumptions and judgments made by our management in their application have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty and actual results could differ from our estimates

business combinations

the company applied the provisions of accounting standards codification “asc” topic 805 “business combinations” in the accounting for the circus renosilver legacy purchase and the mtr merger it required us to recognize the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair values goodwill as of the reno acquisition date was measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed

 

accounting for business combinations required our management to make significant estimates and assumptions including our estimate of intangible assets such as gaming licenses trade names and loyalty programs although we believe the assumptions and estimates made have been reasonable and appropriate they are inherently uncertain for our gaming license valuation our properties estimated future cash flows were the primary assumption in the respective intangible valuations cash flow estimates included assumptions regarding factors such as recent and budgeted operating pe rformance net win per unit revenue patron visits and growth percentages the growth percentages were developed considering general macroeconomic conditions as well as competitive impacts from current and anticipated competition through a review of cust omer market data operating margins and current regulatory social and economic climates the most significant of the assumptions used in the valuations included 1 revenue growthdecline percentages 2 discount rates 3 effective income tax rates 4 future terminal values and 5 capital expenditure assumptions these assumptions were developed for each of our properties based on historical trends in the current competitive markets in which they operate and projections of future performance and c ompetition the primary assumptions with respect to our trade names and loyalty program intangibles primary assumptions were selecting the appropriate royalty rates and cost estimates for replacement cost analyses 

in addition uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed in connection with a business combination are initially estimated as of the business combination date we reevaluated these items quarterly based upon facts and circumstances that existed as of the business combination date with any adjustments to our preliminary estimates being recorded to goodwill if identified within the measurement period subsequent to the measurement period or our final determination of the tax allowance’s or contingency’s estimated value whichever comes first changes to these uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances will affect our provision for income taxes in our consolidated statement of operations and could have material impact on our results of operations and financial position

revenue recognition

gaming revenues consist of the net win from gaming activities which is the difference between amounts wagered and amounts paid to winning patrons and is recognized at the time wagers are made net of winning payouts to patrons base and progressive jackpots are accrued and charged to revenue at the time the obligation to pay the jackpot is established pari‑mutuel commissions consist of commissions earned from thoroughbred and harness racing and importing of simulcast signals from other race tracks pari‑mutuel commissions are recognized at the time wagers are made such commissions are a designated portion of the wagering handle as determined by state racing commissions and are shown net of the taxes assessed by state and local agencies as well as purses and other contractual amounts paid to horsemen associations we recognize revenues from fees earned through the exporting of simulcast signals to other race tracks at the time wagers are made such fees are based upon a predetermined percentage of handle as contracted with the other race tracks revenues from food and beverage are recognized at the time of sale and revenues from lodging are recognized on the date of stay other revenues are recorded at the time services are rendered or merchandise sold we offer certain promotional allowances to our customers including complimentary lodging food and beverage and promotional credits for free play on slot machines the retail value of these promotional items is shown as a reduction in total revenues on our consolidated statements of operations

income taxes

the company and its subsidiaries file us federal income tax returns and various state and local income tax returns the company does not have tax sharing agreements with the other members within the consolidated eri group with few exceptions the company is no longer subject to us federal or state and local tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2013

the company was notified by the internal revenue service in october of 2016 that its federal tax return for the year ended december 31 2014 had been selected for examination as of december 31 2016 there have been no proposed adjustments management believes that its tax positions are appropriate and that an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations however the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty if any issues addressed in the company’s tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with management’s expectations we would be required to adjust our provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs while the company believes its reported results are materially accurate any significant adjustments could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations cash flows and financial position if not resolved within expectations

 

for the year ended december 31 2014 the difference between the effective rate and the statutory rate is attributed primarily to the federal and state valuation allowances on the company’s deferred tax assets as a result of the company’s net operating losses and net deferred tax asset position as of december 31 2014 after exclusion of certain deferred tax liabilities that gene rally cannot be offset against deferred tax assets known as “naked credits” the company provided for a full valuation allowance against substantially all of the net federal and state deferred tax assets 

for the year ended december 31 2015 the difference between the effective rate and the statutory rate is attributable primarily to the release of a majority of the federal and related state valuation allowances on the company’s deferred tax assets and the nontaxable gain on the fair value adjustment of a previously unconsolidated affiliate the company continues to provide for a valuation allowance against net federal and state deferred tax assets associated with nonoperating land the sale of which could result in capital losses that can only be offset against capital gains as of december 31 2015 the company also continued to provide for a valuation allowance against net state deferred tax assets relating to operations in pennsylvania and west virginia management determined it was not morelikelythannot that the company will realize these net deferred tax assets

for the year ended december 31 2016 the difference between the effective rate and the statutory rate is attributable primarily to the release of a majority of the state valuation allowances on the company’s west virginia deferred tax assets and excess tax benefits on stock compensation under accounting standards update 201609 compensation – stock compensation which the company adopted effective the first quarter of 2016 the company continues to provide for a valuation allowance against net federal and state deferred tax assets associated with nonoperating land the sale of which could result in capital losses that can only be offset against capital gains the company also continues to provide for a valuation allowance against net state deferred tax assets relating to operations in pennsylvania management determined it was not morelikelythannot that the company will realize these net deferred tax assets

a valuation allowance is recognized if based on the weight of available evidence it is morelikelythannot that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized management must analyze all available positive and negative evidence regarding realization of the deferred tax assets and make an assessment of the likelihood of sufficient future taxable income for the year ended december 31 2014 the company was in a threeyear cumulative loss position which was significant negative evidence and the company did not have positive evidence to outweigh the negative evidence for the year ended december 31 2015 the company’s position changed to a threeyear cumulative income position and management concluded it is morelikelythannot to realize its federal louisiana and city of columbus ohio deferred tax assets with the exception of nonoperating land in addition for the year ended december 31 2016 the company remained in a threeyear cumulative income position and management concluded it is morelikelythannot to realize its federal louisiana city of columbus ohio and west virginia deferred tax assets with the exception of nonoperating land the company continues to provide for a valuation allowance against net state deferred tax assets relating to operations in pennsylvania management determined it was not morelikelythannot that the company will realize these net deferred tax assets the company will continue to evaluate the realization of its deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis and make adjustments to its valuation allowance as appropriate

for income tax purposes the company amortizes or depreciates certain assets that have been assigned an indefinite life for book purposes for the year ended december 31 2014 the incremental amortization or depreciation deductions for income tax purposes resulted in an increase in certain deferred tax liabilities that could not be used as a source of future taxable income for purposes of measuring the company’s need for a valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets therefore the company recorded non‑cash deferred tax expense of 11 million as the company amortized these assets for tax purposes

prior to the mtr merger date holdco was taxed as a partnership under the internal revenue code pursuant to which income taxes were primarily the responsibility of the partners the company is a c corporation subject to the federal and state corporate‑level income taxes at prevailing corporate tax rates while taxed as a partnership holdco was not subject to federal income tax liability because holders of membership interests in holdco were required to include their respective shares of holdco’s taxable income including that of resorts in their individual income tax returns distributions were made to their respective members to cover such tax liabilities such distributions were subject to limitation in accordance with the provisions of their respective operating agreements eldorado shreveport 2 llc has elected as a single member limited liability company to be taxed as a c corporation current and deferred income taxes associated with eldorado shreveport 2 llc were not material

 

under the applicable accounting standards we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more ‑likely ‑than ‑not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured base d on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement the accounting standards also provide guidance on de ‑recognition classification interest and penalties on income taxes accounting in interim peri ods and disclosure requirements for uncertain tax positions we have recorded no liability associated with uncertain tax positions at december 31 2016 and 2015 

property and equipment and other long‑lived assets

property and equipment is recorded at cost except for the silver legacy circus reno and the mtr gaming properties which were adjusted for fair value under asc 805 and are depreciated over their remaining estimated useful life or lease term judgments are made in determining estimated useful lives and salvage values of these assets the accuracy of these estimates affects the amount of depreciation expense recognized in our financial results and whether we have a gain or loss on the disposal of assets we review depreciation estimates and methods as new events occur more experience is acquired and additional information is obtained that would possibly change our current estimates

property equipment and other long‑lived assets are assessed for impairment in accordance with asc 360— property plant and equipment  the company evaluates its long‑lived assets periodically for impairment issues or more frequently whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable recoverability of these assets is determined by comparing the net carrying value to the sum of the estimated future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by these assets the amount of impairment loss if any is measured by the difference between the net carrying value and the estimated fair value of the asset which is typically measured using a discounted cash flow model level 3 of the fair value hierarchy for assets to be disposed of impairment is recognized based on the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs of disposal as estimated based on comparable asset sales offers received or a discounted cash flow model based on the results of our periodic reviews we have not recorded any impairment losses during the years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014

for undeveloped properties including non‑operating real properties when indicators of impairment are present properties are evaluated for impairment and losses are recorded when undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by an asset or market comparisons are less than the asset’s carrying amount the amount of the impairment loss is calculated as the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its fair value which is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis management estimates or market comparisons the fair value measurements employed for our impairment evaluations which are subject to the assumptions and factors as previously discussed were generally based on a review of comparable activities in the marketplace which falls within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy

goodwill and other indefinite‑lived intangible assets

goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price paid over the fair value of the net assets of the acquired business intangible assets acquired in business combinations are recorded based upon their fair value at the date of acquisition goodwill and other indefinite‑lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment annually during the fourth quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired

goodwill is tested by comparing the carrying value of the reporting unit to its fair value the company estimates the fair value of the reporting unit utilizing income and market approaches the income approach is based on projected future cash flow that is discounted to present value using factors that consider the timing and risk of the future cash flows the market approach is based on the company’s market capitalization at the testing date 

our indefinite‑lived intangible assets consist of racing and gaming licenses and trade names and are evaluated for impairment annually by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying value any excess of carrying value over the fair value is recognized as an impairment within the consolidated statement of operations in the period of review

 

the gaming and racing licenses were valued in aggregate for each respective property as these licenses are considered to be the most significant asset of the properties and the gaming licenses could not be obtained without holding the racing licenses therefore a market participant would consider the licenses in aggregate the fair value of the licenses is calculated using an excess earnings methodology which is an income approach methodology that a llocates the projected cash flows of the property to the gaming license intangible assets less charges for the use of the other identifiable assets of the property including working capital fixed assets and other intangible assets we believe this metho dology is appropriate as the gaming licenses are the primary asset to the properties the licenses are linked to each respective facility and it’s the lowest level at which discrete cash flows can be directly attributable to the assets under the gaming le gislation applicable to our properties licenses are property specific and can only be acquired if a buyer acquires the existing facility because existing licenses may not be acquired and transferred for use at a different facility the estimated future c ash flows of each of our properties was the primary assumption in the valuation of such property 

the company values trade names using the relief‑from‑royalty method with royalty rates range from 05 ‑ 10 trade names recorded as part of the mtr merger are amortized on a straight‑line basis over a 35 year useful life and the trade names recorded as part of the reno acquisition are not amortized deemed indefinitelived 

the loyalty programs were valued using a combination of a replacement cost and lost profits analysis and the loyalty programs are amortized on a straight‑line basis over a one year useful life 

assessing goodwill and indefinite‑lived intangible assets for impairment is a process that requires significant judgment and involves detailed quantitative and qualitative business‑specific analysis and many individual assumptions which fluctuate between assessments our properties’ estimated future cash flows are a primary assumption in the respective impairment analyses unforeseen events changes in circumstances and market conditions and material differences in estimates of future cash flows could negatively affect the fair value of our assets and result in an impairment charge which could be material cash flow estimates include assumptions regarding factors such as recent and budgeted operating performance net win per unit revenue patron visits growth percentages which are developed considering general macroeconomic conditions as well as competitive impacts from current and anticipated competition through a review of customer market data operating margins and current regulatory social and economic climates these estimates could also be negatively impacted by changes in federal state or local regulations economic downturns or developments and other market conditions affecting travel and access to the properties the most significant of the assumptions used in our valuations include 1 revenue growthdecline percentages 2 discount rates 3 effective income tax rates 4 future terminal values and 5 capital expenditure assumptions these assumptions were developed for each property based on historical trends the current competitive markets in which they operate and projections of future performance and competition

we believe we have used reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the fair value of our goodwill reporting units and other indefinite‑lived intangible assets however these estimates and assumptions could be materially different from actual results if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected or if events occur or circumstances change that would reduce the fair value of our licensing intangibles below the carrying value reflected on the consolidated balance sheet we may be required to conduct an interim test or possibly recognize impairment charges which may be material in future periods

reserve for uncollectible accounts receivable

we reserve an estimated amount for receivables that may not be collected methodologies for estimating bad debt reserves range from specific reserves to various percentages applied to aged receivables historical collection rates are considered as are customer relationships in determining specific reserves as with many estimates management must make judgments about potential actions by third parties in establishing and evaluating our reserves for bad debts

self‑insurance reserves

the company is self‑insured for various levels of general liability employee medical insurance coverage and workers’ compensation coverage self‑insurance reserves are estimated based on the company’s claims experience and are included in accrued other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets

 

loyalty program 

we offer programs whereby our participating patrons can accumulate points for wagering that can be redeemed for credits for free play on slot machines lodging food and beverage merchandise and in limited situations cash based upon the estimated redemptions of loyalty program points an estimated liability is established for the cost of redemption on earned but unredeemed points the estimated cost of redemption utilizes estimates and assumptions of the mix of the various product offerings for which the points will be redeemed and costs of such product offerings changes in the programs membership levels and redemption patterns of our participating patrons can impact this liability

litigation claims and assessments

we utilize estimates for litigation claims and assessments these estimates are based on our knowledge and experience regarding current and past events as well as assumptions about future events if our assessment of such a matter should change we may have to change the estimates which may have an adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows actual results could differ from these estimates

recently issued accounting pronouncements

in may 2014 amended january 2017 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued accounting standards update “asu” no 2014‑09 “revenue from contracts with customers” which provides guidance for revenue recognition the new standard outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and eliminates existing industry guidance including revenue recognition guidance specific to the gaming industry the fasb has also recently issued several amendments to the standard including narrowscope improvements and practical expedients asu 201612 and clarification on accounting for and identifying performance obligations asu 201610 the core principle of the revenue model indicates that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services the standard is designed to create greater comparability for financial statement users across industries and jurisdictions and also requires enhanced disclosures the guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december 15 2017 and should be applied using the full retrospective method or retrospectively with the cumulative effect initially applying the guidance recognized at the date of initial application while early adoption is permitted for interim and annual periods beginning after december 15 2016 we anticipate adopting this standard on january 1 2018 we are currently in the process of evaluating the full impact adoption of asu 2014‑09 as amended will have on our consolidated financial statements however we anticipate this new standard will likely have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements

we expect the most significant effect upon adoption of asu 201409 as amended will likely be related to 1 the accounting for our customer loyalty program no longer be recorded at cost and a deferred revenue model will likely be used to account for the classification and timing of revenue recognized as well as the classification of related expenses for loyalty point redemptions and 2 the elimination of promotional allowances the presentation of goods and services provided to our customers without charge included in gross revenue with a corresponding reduction in promotional allowances will no longer be reported as revenue and will be recognized based on relative standalone selling prices for transactions with more than one performance obligation as a result we expect that gaming revenues will be reduced with a corresponding increase in total to food and beverage hotel and other revenues given our evaluation process is ongoing the quantitative effects of these changes have not yet been fully determined and are still being analyzed additionally as we continue through our process further impacts to our financial statements may be identified and we will provide updates in our upcoming quarterly filings

in january 2017 the fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 201704 “intangibles – goodwill and other simplifying the test for goodwill impairment” this amended guidance is intended to simplify how an entity is required to test goodwill for impairment by eliminating step 2 from the goodwill impairment test step 2 measures goodwill impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of a reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying amount of goodwill under the amended guidance an entity should perform its annual or interim goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount the elimination of step 2 from the goodwill impairment test should reduce the cost and complexity of evaluating goodwill for impairment amendments should be applied on a prospective basis disclosing the nature of and reason for the change in accounting principle upon transition disclosure should be provided in the first annual period and in the interim period in which the entity initially adopts the amendments updated amendments are effective for the interim and annual periods beginning after december 15 2019  and early adoption is permitted we are currently evaluating the impact and timing of adopting this guidance but anticipate early adoption in 2017 

 

in january 2017 the fasb issued asu no 201701 “business combinations – clarifying the definition of a business” this amendment is intended to clarify the definition of a business with the objective of adding guidance to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as a cquisition or disposals of assets or businesses amendments in this update provide a more robust framework to use in determining when a set of assets and activities is a business and to provide more consistency in applying the guidance reduce the costs of application and make the definition of a business more operable the amendments are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december 15 2017 early adoption is allowed as follows 1 transactions for which acquisition date occurs bef ore the issuance date or effective date of the amendments only when the transaction has not been reported in financial statements that have been issued or made available for issuance and 2 transactions in which a subsidiary is deconsolidated or a group of assets is derecognized that occur before the issuance date or effective date of the amendments only when the transaction has not been reported in financial statements that have been issued or made available for issuance the adoption will result in fut ure acquisitions which do not involve substantive processes being accounted for as asset acquisitions 

in november 2016 the fasb issued asu no 201618 “statement of cash flows – restricted cash” this guidance requires that a statement of cash flows explain the change during the period in the total of cash cash equivalents and amounts generally described as restricted cash and cash equivalents the amendments in this update are effective for the interim and annual periods beginning after december 15 2017 early adoption is permitted including adoption in an interim period we currently anticipate adopting this accounting standard during the first quarter of 2018 and we are still evaluating the impact on our consolidated financial statements

in august 2016 the fasb issued asu no 201615 “classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments” this new guidance is intended to reduce diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and payments are classified in the statement of cash flows including debt prepayment or extinguishment costs the settlement of contingent liabilities arising from a business combination proceeds from insurance settlements and distributions from certain equity method investees the guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december 15 2017 and early adoption is permitted the guidance requires application using a retrospective transition method we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance on our consolidated financial statements

in june 2016 the fasb issued asu no 201613 “accounting for credit losses” which amends the guidance on the impairment of financial instruments this update adds an impairment model known as the current expected credit losses model that is based on expected losses rather than incurred losses under the new guidance an entity recognizes as an allowance its estimate of expected credit losses the effective date for this update is for the annual and interim periods beginning after december 15 2019 and early adoption is permitted beginning after december 15 2018 we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance on our consolidated financial statements

in march 2016 the fasb issued asu no 201609 “compensation—stock compensation” this asu includes multiple provisions intended to simplify various aspects of the accounting for sharebased payments these areas include income tax consequences classification of awards as either equity or a liability and classification on the statement of cash flow the effective date is for annual and interim periods beginning after december 15 2016 with early adoption permitted we elected to early adopt this asu prospectively in the first quarter of 2016 under the new guidance we recognized a reduction in income tax expense of 08 million for the year ended december 31 2016 there were no excess tax benefits for the year ended december 31 2015

in february 2016 the fasb issued asu no 201602 which addresses the recognition and measurement of leases under the new guidance for all leases with the exception of shortterm leases at the commencement date lessees will be required to recognize a lease liability which is a lessee’s obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease measured on a discounted basis and a rightofuse “rou” asset which is an asset that represents the lessee’s right to use or control the use of a specified asset for the lease term under the new guidance lessor accounting is largely unchanged further the new lease guidance simplifies the accounting for sale and leaseback transactions primarily because lessees must recognize lease assets and liabilities which no longer provides a source for off balance sheet financing the effective date for this update is for the annual and interim periods beginning after december 15 2018 with early adoption permitted lessees and lessors must apply a modified retrospective transition approach for leases existing at or entered into after the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the consolidated financial statements

 

currently we do not have any material capital leases nor any material operating leases where we are the lessor our operating leases primarily relating to certain ground leases and slot machines or video lottery terminals vlts will be recorded on the balance sheet as an rou asset with a corresponding lease liability which will be amortized using the effective interest rate method as payments are made the rou asset wil l be depreciated on a straightline basis and recognized as lease expense the qualitative and quantitative effects of adoption of asu 201602 are still being analyzed and we are in the process of evaluating the full effect the new guidance will have on o ur consolidated financial statements

competition 

the gaming industry includes land ‑based casinos dockside casinos riverboat casinos casinos located on native american reservations and other forms of legalized gaming there is intense competition among companies in the gaming industry many of which have significantly greater resources than we do certain states have legalized casino gaming and other states may legalize gaming in the future legalized casino gaming in these states and on native american reservations near our markets or changes to gaming laws in states surrounding nevada louisiana west virginia pennsylvania or ohio could increase competition and could adversely affect our operations we also compete to a lesser extent with gaming facilities in other jurisdictions with dockside gaming facilities state sponsored lotteries on ‑and ‑off track pari ‑mutuel wagering card clubs riverboat casinos and other forms of legalized gambling in addition various forms of internet gaming have been approved in nevada and new jersey and legislation permitting internet gaming has been proposed by the federal government and other states the expansion of internet gaming in nevada and other jurisdictions could result in significant additional competition 

nevada of the 30 casinos currently operating in the reno market we believe we compete principally with the six hotel ‑casinos like eldorado reno and silver legacy that each generate at least 36 million in annual gaming revenues at this time we cannot predict the extent to which new and proposed projects will be undertaken or the extent to which current hotel andor casino space may be expanded we expect that any additional rooms added in the reno market will increase competition for visitor revenue there can be no assurance that any growth in reno’s current room base or gaming capacity will not adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 

we also compete with hotel ‑casinos located in the nearby lake tahoe region as well as those in other areas of nevada including las vegas a substantial number of customers travel to both reno and the lake tahoe area during their visits consequently we believe that our success is influenced to some degree by the success of the lake tahoe market the number of visitors increased during the year ended december 31 2015 compared with the prior year and while we do not anticipate a significant change in the popularity of either reno or lake tahoe as tourist destination areas in the foreseeable future any decline could adversely affect our operations 

since visitors from california comprise a significant portion of our customer base we also compete with native american gaming operations in california in total the state of california has signed and ratified compacts with 72 native american tribes and there are currently 60 native american casinos operating in california including casinos located in northern california which we consider to be a significant target market these native american tribes are allowed to operate slot machines lottery games and banking and percentage games on native american lands 

management believes the reno market draws over 50 of its visitors from california as northern california native american gaming operations have expanded we believe the increasing competition generated by these gaming operations has negatively impacted and may continue to negatively impact principally drive ‑in day ‑trip visitor traffic from our main feeder markets in northern california  

louisiana the shreveportbossier city louisiana gaming market is characterized by intense competition and the market has not grown appreciably since eldorado shreveport opened in december 2000 we compete directly with 

 

five casinos all but one of which have operated in the shreveportbossier city market for several years and have established customer bases in addition we also compete with the slot machine facility at harrah’s louisiana casino and racetrack located in bossier city and winstar casino and casino facilities owned by the choctaw nation located in oklahoma casino gaming is currently prohibited in several jurisdictions from which the shreveportbossier city market draws customers primarily texas the texas legislature has from time to time considered proposals to legalize gaming any such proposal would require an amendment to the texas state constitution which requires approval by two ‑thirds of the texas state legislature and approval by a majority of votes cast in a statewide voter referendum such approvals would legalize gaming in texas notwithstanding vetoes by the governor of casino gambling bills there can be no assurance that casino gaming will not be approved in texas in the future which would have a material adverse effect on our business eldorado shreveport competes with several native american casinos located in oklahoma certain of which are located near our core texas markets because eldorado shreveport draws a significant amount of customers from the dallasfort worth texas area but is located approximately 190 miles from that area we believe we will continue to face increased competition from gaming operations in oklahoma and would face significant competition that may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations if casino gaming were to be approved in texas 

in june 2013 construction was completed on a hotel casino in bossier city across the red river from eldorado shreveport in december 2014 a new luxury land ‑based casino opened in lake charles louisiana approximately 200 miles south of eldorado shreveport but closer to the houston texas market  

eastern mountaineer presque isle downs and scioto downs primarily compete with gaming facilities located in west virginia ohio and pennsylvania including to a certain extent each other and gaming locations located in neighboring states including new york indiana and michigan in particular mountaineer and to a lesser extent presque isle downs competes with other gaming facilities located in pennsylvania including the rivers casino located in downtown pittsburgh pennsylvania and the meadows racetrack and casino located in washington pennsylvania approximately 50 miles southeast of mountaineer an additional license has been granted for a casino to be located in lawrence county pennsylvania approximately 45 miles from mountaineer and 90 miles from presque isle downs which would result in further competition for both of those properties further gaming facilities in ohio represent our main competition including the horseshoe casino cleveland hollywood casino columbus thistledown racino northfield park and beulah park 

mountaineer competes with smaller gaming operations conducted in local bars and fraternal organizations west virginia law permits limited video lottery machines “lvls” in local bars and fraternal organizations the west virginia lottery commission authorizes up to 7500 slot machines in these facilities throughout west virginia no more than five slot machines are allowed in each establishment licensed to sell alcoholic beverages and no more than ten slot machines are allowed in each licensed fraternal organization as of december 31 2015 there were a total of approximately 1000 lvl’s in bars and fraternal organizations in hancock county west virginia where mountaineer is located and the two neighboring counties brooke and ohio counties although the bars and fraternal organizations housing these machines lack poker and table gaming as well as the amenities and ambiance of our mountaineer facility they do compete with mountaineer particularly for the local patronage 

while there are three other tracks and one resort in west virginia that offer slot machine and table gaming only one wheeling island casino lies within mountaineer’s primary market in wheeling west virginia wheeling island casino currently operates approximately 1400 slot machines nine poker tables and 22 casino table games 

scioto downs has also competed with smaller gaming operations in ohio commonly referred to as internetsweepstakes cafes these establishments offer services including internet time and computer access in addition to offering games such as poker and games that operate like slot machines in march 2013 the ohio general assembly passed legislation which effectively bans the internet cafes by defining use of the computers in these facilities as illegal gambling efforts have been underway to enforce the closure of the internet cafes 

mountaineer’s and to a lesser extent presque isle downs’ racing and pari ‑mutuel operations compete directly for wagering dollars with racing and pari ‑mutuel operations at a variety of other horse and greyhound racetracks that conduct pari ‑mutuel gaming including wheeling island casino in wheeling west virginia thistledown and northfield park in cleveland ohio beulah park in austintown ohio and the meadows racetrack  casino in 

 

washington pennsylvania wheeling island casino conducts pari ‑mutuel greyhound racing simulcasting and casino gaming both thistledown and northfield park conduct pari ‑mutuel horse racing with video lottery gaming which commenced in 2013 beulah park was relocated from columbus ohio to austintown ohio in 2014 and conducts pari ‑mutuel wagering simulcasting and video lottery gaming the meadows racetrack  casino conducts live harness racing simulcasting and casino gaming mountaineer and to a lesser extent presque isle downs also will compete with valley view downs in lawrence county pennsylvania if it is constructed and opened since commencing export simulcasting in august 2000 mountaineer competes with racetracks across the country to have its signal carried by off ‑track wagering parlors mountaineer presque isle downs and scioto downs also competes for wagering dollars with off ‑track wagering facilities in ohio and pennsylvania and competes with other racetracks for participation by quality racehorses 

general all of our gaming operations also compete to a lesser extent with operations in other locations including native american lands and with other forms of legalized gaming in the united states including state ‑sponsored lotteries on ‑ and off ‑track wagering high ‑stakes bingo card parlors and the emergence of internet gaming including proposals at the state and federal levels that would legalize various forms of internet gaming in addition casinos in canada have likewise recently begun advertising and increasing promotional activities in our target markets see “item 1a risk factors—risks related to our business— we face substantial competition in the hotel and casino industry and expect that such competition will continue ” which is included elsewhere in this report  

governmental gaming regulations 

the gaming and racing industries are highly regulated and we must maintain our licenses and pay gaming taxes to continue our operations we are subject to extensive regulation under laws rules and supervisory procedures primarily in the jurisdictions where our facilities are located or docked these laws rules and regulations generally concern the responsibility financial stability and characters of the owners managers and persons with financial interests in the gaming operations if additional gaming regulations are adopted in a jurisdiction in which we operate such regulations could impose restrictions or costs that could have a significant adverse effect on us from time to time various proposals have been introduced in legislatures of jurisdictions in which we have operations that if enacted could adversely affect the tax regulatory operational or other aspects of the gaming industry and us we do not know whether or when such legislation will be enacted gaming companies are currently subject to significant state and local taxes and fees in addition to normal federal and state corporate income taxes and such taxes and fees are subject to increase at any time any material increase in these taxes or fees could adversely affect us

the internal revenue service requires operators of casinos located in the united states to file information returns for us citizens including names and addresses of winners for keno bingo and slot machine winnings in excess of stipulated amounts the internal revenue service also requires operators to withhold taxes on some keno bingo and slot machine winnings of nonresident aliens we are unable to predict the extent to which these requirements if extended might impede or otherwise adversely affect operations of andor income from the other games 

regulations adopted by the financial crimes enforcement network of the treasury department “fincen” and the nevada gaming authorities require the reporting of currency transactions in excess of 10000 occurring within a gaming day including identification of the patron by name and social security number this reporting obligation began in may 1985 and may have resulted in the loss of gaming revenues to jurisdictions outside the united states which are exempt from the ambit of these regulations in addition to currency transaction reporting requirements suspicious financial activity is also required to be reported to fincen  

other laws and regulations

 item 1a risk factors 

risks related to eri’s capital structure and equity ownership 

we have significant indebtedness 

on july 23 2015 the company issued 375 million in aggregate principal amount of 70 senior notes due 2023 “senior notes” and entered into a new 4250 million seven year term loan the “new term loan” and a new 1500 million five year revolving credit facility the “new revolving credit facility” and together with the new term loan the “new credit facility” as a result of our new credit facility and outstanding senior notes we have a significant amount of indebtedness as of december 31 2015 we and our restricted subsidiaries had 8914 million of total indebtedness outstanding of which 5164 million was secured and 565 million of availability under the new credit facility this indebtedness may have important negative consequences for us including  

• limiting our ability to satisfy our obligations 

• increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions 

• limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our businesses and the markets in which we operate 

• placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors that have less debt 

• increasing our vulnerability to and limiting our ability to react to changing market conditions changes in our industry and economic downturns 

• limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund working capital requirements capital expenditures debt service general corporate or other obligations 

• subjecting us to a number of restrictive covenants that among other things limit our ability to pay dividends and distributions make acquisitions and dispositions borrow additional funds and make capital expenditures and other investments 

• limiting our ability to use operating cash flow in other areas of its business because we must dedicate a significant portion of these funds to make principal andor interest payments on our outstanding debt 

• exposing us to interest rate risk due to the variable interest rate on borrowings under our new credit facility 

• causing our failure to comply with the financial and restrictive covenants contained in our current or future indebtedness which could cause a default under such indebtedness and which if not cured or waived could have a material adverse effect on us and 

• affecting our ability to renew gaming and other licenses necessary to conduct our business  

despite our current indebtedness levels we and our subsidiaries may still incur significant additional indebtedness incurring more indebtedness could increase the risks associated with our substantial indebtedness 

 

  

we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness including additional secured indebtedness in the future the terms of the indenture governing the senior notes the “indenture” and our credit agreement governing our new credit facility restrict but will not completely prohibit us from doing so as of december 31 2015 we had 565 million of borrowing availability under our new credit facility the indenture will also allow us to incur certain other additional secured and unsecured debt and does not prevent us from incurring other liabilities that do not constitute indebtedness  

  

we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness which may not be successful 

  

our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial business legislative regulatory and other factors beyond our control we will also be required to obtain the consent of the lenders under the senior secured credit facilities to refinance material portions of our indebtedness we cannot assure you that we will maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal premium if any and interest on our indebtedness 

  

if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to sell assets seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness these alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations if our operating results and available cash are insufficient to meet our debt service obligations we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations we may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain the proceeds that we could realize from them and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due additionally the credit agreement governing the new credit facility and the indenture limits the use of the proceeds from any disposition as a result we may not be allowed under these documents to use proceeds from such dispositions to satisfy all current debt service obligations  

  

the indenture governing the notes and the credit agreement governing the new credit facility will impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries which may prevent us from capitalizing on business opportunities 

  

the credit agreement governing the new credit facility and the indenture will impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us these restrictions limit our ability among other things to  

• incur additional debt 

• create liens or other encumbrances 

• pay dividends or make other restricted payments 

• agree to payment restrictions affecting our restricted subsidiaries 

• prepay subordinated indebtedness 

• make investments loans or other guarantees 

• sell or otherwise dispose of a portion of our assets or 

• make acquisitions or merge or consolidate with another entity  

in addition the credit agreement governing the new credit facility contains certain financial covenants including minimum interest coverage ratio and maximum total leverage ratio covenants 

 

as a result of these covenants and restrictions we are limited in how we conduct our business and we may be unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities the restrictions caused by such covenants could also place us at a competitive disadvantage to less leveraged competitors 

a failure to comply with the covenants contained in the credit agreement governing the new credit facility indenture or other indebtedness that we may incur in the future could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could result in the acceleration of the indebtedness and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations if our indebtedness were to be accelerated there can be no assurance that our assets would be sufficient to repay such indebtedness in full moreover in the event that such indebtedness is accelerated there can be no assurance that we will be able to refinance it on acceptable terms or at all  

we are a holding company and will depend on our subsidiaries for dividends distributions and repayment of our indebtedness 

we are structured as a holding company a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries our only significant asset is the capital stock or other equity interests of our operating subsidiaries as a holding company we conduct all of our business through our subsidiaries consequently our principal source of cash flow will be dividends and distributions from our subsidiaries if our subsidiaries are unable to make dividend payments or distributions to us and sufficient cash or liquidity is not otherwise available we may not be able to pay interest or principal on our indebtedness  

our ability to service all of our indebtedness depends on our ability to generate cash flow which is subject to factors that are beyond our control 

our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance which is subject to general economic financial competitive and other factors that are beyond our control in addition a further deterioration in the economic performance of our casino properties may cause us to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to sell assets in the absence of such operating results and resources we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations  

the market price of eri’s common stock could fluctuate significantly 

the us securities markets in general have experienced significant price fluctuations in recent years the market price of eri’s common stock may be volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in addition the trading volume of eri’s common stock may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur some of the factors that could cause fluctuations in or have a material adverse effect on the stock price or trading volume of eri’s common stock include  

• general market and economic conditions including market conditions in the hotel and casino industries 

• actual or expected variations in operating results 

• differences between actual operating results and those expected by investors and analysts 

• changes in recommendations by securities analysts 

• operations and stock performance of competitors 

• accounting charges including charges relating to the impairment of goodwill 

• significant acquisitions or strategic alliances by eri or by competitors 

 

• sales of eri’s common stock or other securities in the future including sales by our directors and officers or significant investors 

• recruitment or departure of key personnel 

• conditions and trends in the gaming and entertainment industries 

• changes in the estimate of the future size and growth of our markets and 

• changes in reserves for professional liability claims  

we cannot assure you that the stock price of eri common stock will not fluctuate or decline significantly in the future in addition the stock market in general can experience considerable price and volume fluctuations that may be unrelated to eri’s performance if the market price of eri common stock fluctuates significantly eri may become the subject of securities class action litigation which may result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources  

eri has not historically paid dividends and the credit agreement governing the new credit facility and the indenture contain restrictive covenants limiting our ability to pay dividends 

eri does not currently expect to pay dividends on its common stock any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of the eri board of directors and will depend upon among other factors eri’s earnings cash requirements financial condition requirements to comply with the covenants under its debt instruments legal considerations and other factors that the eri board of directors deems relevant if eri does not pay dividends then the return on an investment in its common stock will depend entirely upon any future appreciation in its stock price there is no guarantee that eri’s common stock will appreciate in value or maintain its value  

the volatility and disruption of the capital and credit markets and adverse changes in the us and global economies may negatively impact our access to financing 

during recent years a confluence of many factors has contributed to diminished expectations for the us economy and increased market volatility for publicly traded securities including the common shares and notes issued by public companies these factors include the availability and cost of credit declining business and consumer confidence and increased unemployment these conditions have combined to create an unprecedented level of market volatility which could negatively impact our ability to access capital and financing including financing necessary to refinance our existing indebtedness on terms and at prices acceptable to us that we would otherwise need in connection with the operation of our businesses  

risk factors relating to our operations 

our business is sensitive to reductions in discretionary consumer spending as a result of downturns in the economy 

consumer demand for casino hotel and racetrack properties such as ours is particularly sensitive to downturns in the economy and the associated impact on discretionary spending on leisure activities changes in discretionary consumer spending or consumer preferences brought about by factors such as perceived or actual general economic conditions effects of declines in consumer confidence in the economy including the recent housing employment and credit crisis the impact of high energy and food costs the increased cost of travel the potential for continued bank failures decreased disposable consumer income and wealth or fears of war and future acts of terrorism could further reduce customer demand for the amenities that we offer which have had and may continue to have a negative impact on our results of operations increases in gasoline prices including increases prompted by global political and economic instabilities can adversely affect our operations because most of our patrons travel to our properties by car or on airlines that may pass on increases in fuel costs to passengers in the form of higher ticket prices economic downturns and other related factors which impact discretionary consumer spending and other economic activities have had direct effects on 

 

our business and the tourism industry in the past we cannot be sure how these factors will impact our operations in the future or the extent of the impact  

we face substantial competition in the hotel and casino industry and expect that such competition will continue 

the gaming industry is characterized by an increasingly high degree of competition among a large number of participants including land ‑based casinos dockside casinos riverboat casinos casinos located on native american reservations and other forms of legalized gaming there is intense competition among companies in the gaming industry many of which have significantly greater resources than we do certain states have legalized casino gaming and other states may legalize gaming in the future legalized casino gaming in these states and on native american reservations near our markets or changes to gaming laws in states surrounding nevada louisiana west virginia pennsylvania or ohio could increase competition and could adversely affect our operations we also compete to a lesser extent with gaming facilities in other jurisdictions with dockside gaming facilities state sponsored lotteries on ‑and ‑off track pari ‑mutuel wagering card clubs riverboat casinos and other forms of legalized gambling in addition various forms of internet gaming have been approved in nevada and new jersey and legislation permitting internet gaming has been proposed by the federal government and other states the expansion of internet gaming in nevada and other jurisdictions could result in significant additional competition 

gaming competition is intense in most of the markets in which we operate there has been significant competition in our markets as a result of the expansion of facilities by existing market participants the entrance of new gaming participants into a market or legislative changes in prior years for example casino gaming is currently prohibited in several jurisdictions from which the shreveportbossier city market draws customers primarily texas the texas legislature has from time to time considered proposals to legalize gaming and there can be no assurance that casino gaming will not be approved in texas in the future which would have a material adverse effect on our business additionally since visitors from california comprise a significant portion of our customer base in reno we also compete with native american gaming operations in california native american tribes are allowed to operate slot machines lottery games and banking and percentage games on native american lands although many existing native american gaming facilities in northern california are modest compared to the nevada properties a number of native american tribes have established large ‑scale gaming facilities in california additionally a hotel casino opened in bossier city across the red river from eldorado shreveport opened in june 2013 and in december 2014 a land ‑based opened in lake charles louisiana approximately 200 miles south of eldorado shreveport but closer to the houston texas market with respect to our mtr gaming facilities an additional license has been granted for a casino to be located in lawrence county pennsylvania approximately 45 miles from mountaineer and 90 miles from presque isle downs which would result in further competition for both of those properties further gaming facilities in ohio that commenced operations in recent years including the horseshoe casino cleveland hollywood casino columbus thistledown racino austintown hollywood mahoning casino hollywood casinos at dayton raceway and northfield park present significant competition for mountaineer presque isle downs and scioto downs 

increased competition may require us to make substantial capital expenditures to maintain and enhance the competitive positions of our properties to increase the attractiveness and add to the appeal of our facilities because we are highly leveraged after satisfying our obligations under our outstanding indebtedness there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient funds to undertake these expenditures or that we will be able to obtain sufficient financing to fund such expenditures if we are unable to make such expenditures our competitive position could be materially adversely affected  

we will be subject to extensive state and local regulation and licensing and gaming authorities have significant control over our operations which could have an adverse effect on our business 

the ownership and operation of casino gaming riverboat and horseracing facilities are subject to extensive federal state and local regulation and regulatory authorities at the federal state and local levels have broad powers with respect to the licensing of gaming businesses and may revoke suspend condition or limit our gaming or other licenses impose substantial fines and take other actions each of which poses a significant risk to our business financial condition and results of operations we currently hold all state and local licenses and related approvals necessary to conduct our present gaming operations but we must periodically apply to renew many of our licenses and registrations 

 

we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such renewals any failure to maintain or renew our existing licenses registrations permits or approvals would have a material adverse effect on us furthermore if additional laws or regulations are adopted or existing laws or regulations are amended these regulations could impose additional restrictions or costs that could have a significant adverse effect on us as an example on august 26 2014 the board of health of hancock county west virginia adopted and approved the clean air regulation act of 2014 “regulation” which became effective july 1 2015 the regulation bans smoking in public places in hancock county including at mountaineer to comply with the regulation upon its effective date mountaineer built a 9300 square foot smoking pavilion which opened on july 1 2015 and currently houses 216 slot machines and six table games notwithstanding our efforts to mitigate the impact of the smoking ban the regulation has had a negative impact on our business and results of operations at mountaineer and we expect that it will continue to negatively impact our business and results of operations and such impact may be material 

any of the nevada gaming commission the louisiana gaming control board the west virginia alcohol beverage control administration the west virginia lottery commission the west virginia racing commission the pennsylvania gaming control board the pennsylvania racing commission the pennsylvania liquor control board the ohio lottery commission and the ohio state racing commission which we refer to collectively as the gaming authorities may in their discretion require the holder of any securities issued by us to file applications be investigated and be found suitable to own our securities if it has reason to believe that the security ownership would be inconsistent with the declared policies of their respective jurisdictions further the costs of any investigation conducted by any of the gaming authorities under these circumstances must be paid by the applicant and refusal or failure to pay these charges may constitute grounds for a finding that the applicant is unsuitable to own the securities if any of the gaming authorities determines that a person is unsuitable to own our securities then under the applicable gaming or horse racing laws and regulations we can be sanctioned including the loss of their approvals if without the prior approval of the applicable gaming authority we conduct certain business with the unsuitable person 

our officers directors and key employees will also be subject to a variety of regulatory requirements and various licensing and related approval procedures in the various jurisdictions in which we operate gaming facilities if any of the applicable gaming authorities were to find an officer director or key employee of ours unsuitable for licensing or unsuitable to continue having a relationship with us we would have to sever all relationships with that person furthermore the gaming authorities may require us to terminate the employment of any person who refuses to file appropriate applications either result could materially adversely affect our gaming operations 

applicable gaming laws and regulations restrict our ability to issue securities incur debt and undertake other financing activities such transactions would generally require approval of applicable gaming authorities and our financing counterparties including lenders might be subject to various licensing and related approval procedures in the various jurisdictions in which we operate gaming facilities if state regulatory authorities were to find any person unsuitable with regard to his her or its relationship to us or any of our subsidiaries we would be required to sever our relationships with that person which could materially adversely affect our business 

in addition gaming companies are generally subject to significant revenue based taxes and fees in addition to normal federal state and local income taxes and such taxes and fees are subject to increase at any time we pay substantial taxes and fees with respect to our operations from time to time federal state and local legislators and officials have proposed changes in tax laws or in the administration of such laws affecting the gaming industry in addition worsening economic conditions could intensify the efforts of state and local governments to raise revenues through increases in gaming taxes andor property taxes it is not possible to determine with certainty the likelihood of changes in tax laws or in the administration of such laws such changes if adopted could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations the large number of state and local governments with significant current or projected budget deficits makes it more likely that those governments that currently permit gaming will seek to fund such deficits with new or increased gaming taxes andor property taxes and worsening economic conditions could intensify those efforts any material increase or the adoption of additional taxes or fees could have a material adverse effect on our future financial results 

we rely on our key personnel and we may face difficulties in attracting and retaining qualified employees for our casinos and race tracks 

 

our future success will depend upon among other things our ability to keep our senior executives and highly qualified employees we compete with other potential employers for employees and we may not succeed in hiring or retaining the executives and other employees that we need a sudden loss of or inability to replace key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operation 

in addition the operation of our business requires qualified executives managers and skilled employees with gaming and horse racing industry experience and qualifications who are able to obtain the requisite licenses and approval from the applicable gaming authorities while not currently the case there has from time to time been a shortage of skilled labor in our markets in addition to limitations that may otherwise exist in the supply of skilled labor the continued expansion of gaming near our facilities including the expansion of native american gaming may make it more difficult for us to attract qualified individuals while we believe that we will continue to be able to attract and retain qualified employees shortages of skilled labor will make it increasingly difficult and expensive to attract and retain the services of a satisfactory number of qualified employees and we may incur higher costs than expected as a result  

we depend on agreements with our horsemen and pari ‑mutuel clerks to operate our business 

the federal interstate horse racing act and the state racing laws in west virginia ohio and pennsylvania require that in order to simulcast races we have written agreements with the horse owners and trainers at those racetracks in addition in order to operate slot machines in west virginia we are required to enter into written agreements regarding the proceeds of the slot machines a “proceeds agreement” with a representative of a majority of the horse owners and trainers and with a representative of a majority of the pari ‑mutuel clerks 

if we fail to maintain operative agreements with the horsemen at any of our racetracks we will not be permitted to conduct live racing and export and import simulcasting at the applicable racetrack in addition if we fail to maintain operative agreements with the horsemen at mountaineer presque isle downs and scioto downs including if we do not have in place the legally required proceeds agreement with the mountaineer pari ‑mutuel clerks union we will not be permitted to continue our gaming operations at those facilities if we fail to renew or modify existing agreements on satisfactory terms this failure could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations  

work stoppages organizing drives and other labor problems could negatively impact our future profits 

some of our employees are currently represented by labor unions a lengthy strike or other work stoppages at any of our casino properties could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations given the large number of employees labor unions are making a concerted effort to recruit more employees in the gaming industry in addition organized labor may benefit from new legislation or legal interpretations by the current presidential administration particularly in light of current support for changes to federal and state labor laws we cannot provide any assurance that we will not experience additional and more successful union organization activity in the future  

because portions of the land on which our facilities are situated are leased the termination of such leases could adversely affect our business 

resorts owns the parcel on which eldorado reno is located except for approximately 30000 square feet which is leased from c s  y associates a general partnership of which donald carano father of gary l carano is a general partner the “csy lease” the csy lease expires on june 30 2027 if resorts defaults on a payment under the csy lease or if certain other specified events were to occur c s  y associates has the right to terminate the lease and take possession of the property located on the premises if c s  y associates were to exercise these rights this could adversely affect our business 

a subsidiary of resorts is party to a ground lease with the city of shreveport for the land on which eldorado shreveport was built the “shreveport lease” the shreveport lease automatically renewed on june 17 2015 and will be available for automatic renewal again on december 20 2020 if resorts defaults on a payment under the shreveport 

 

lease or if certain other specified events were to occur the city of shreveport could terminate the lease if the city of shreveport were to exercise this right this could adversely affect our business 

circus reno is situated on a three block area in downtown reno of which approximately 90 of the underlying land is owned by the company and the remainder is held under two separate leases which expire i n 2032 and 2033 respectively if the company defaults on a payment under the leases the lessor could terminate the lease  

  

because we own real property we will be subject to extensive environmental regulation which creates uncertainty regarding future environmental expenditures and liabilities 

we are subject to various federal state and local environmental health and safety laws and regulations that govern activities that may have adverse environmental effects such as discharges to air and water as well as the use storage discharge emission and disposal of solid animal and hazardous wastes and exposure to hazardous materials these laws and regulations are complex and frequently subject to change in addition our horseracing facilities are subject to laws and regulations that address the impacts of manure and wastewater generated by concentrated animal feeding operations “cafo” on water quality including but not limited to storm water discharges cafo regulations include permit requirements and water quality discharge standards enforcement of cafo regulations has been receiving increased governmental attention compliance with these and other environmental laws can in some circumstances require significant capital expenditures we have from time to time been responsible for investigating and remediating or contributing to remediation costs related to contamination located at or near certain of our facilities including contamination related to underground storage tanks and groundwater contamination arising from prior uses of land on which certain of our facilities are located in addition we have been and may in the future be required to manage abate remove or contain manure and wastewater generated by concentrated animal feeding operations due to our racetrack operations mold lead asbestos ‑containing materials or other hazardous conditions found in or on our properties moreover violations can result in significant fines or penalties and in some instances interruption or cessation of operations 

we are also subject to laws and regulations that create liability and cleanup responsibility for releases of regulated materials into the environment certain of these laws and regulations impose strict and under certain circumstances joint and several liability on a current or previous owner or operator of property for the costs of remediating regulated materials on or emanating from its property the costs of investigation remediation or removal of those substances may be substantial  

an earthquake flood act of terrorism other natural disasters could adversely affect our business 

although we maintain insurance that is customary and appropriate for our business each of our insurance policies is subject to certain exclusions in addition in some cases our property insurance coverage is combined among certain of our properties or is otherwise in an amount that may be significantly less than the expected replacement cost of rebuilding our facilities in the event of a total loss such losses may occur as a result of any number of casualty events including as a result of earthquakes floods hurricanes or other severe weather conditions in particular the reno area has been and may in the future be subject to earthquakes and other natural disasters and eldorado shreveport is located in a designated flood zone inadequate insurance or lack of available insurance for these and other certain types or levels of risk could expose us to significant losses in the event that a catastrophe occurred for which we are underinsured in addition to the damage caused to our properties by a casualty loss we may suffer business disruption as a result of the casualty event or be subject to claims by third parties that may be injured or harmed while we carry general liability insurance and business interruption insurance there can be no assurance that insurance will be available or adequate to cover all loss and damage to which our business or our assets might be subjected in addition certain casualty events such as labor strikes nuclear events loss of income due to terrorism deterioration or corrosion insect or animal damage and pollution may not be covered under our policies any losses we incur that are not adequately covered by insurance may decrease our future operating income require us to fund replacements or repairs for destroyed property and reduce the funds available for payments of our obligations in addition upon the expiration of our current policies which expire in august 2016 subject to annual renewal we cannot assure that adequate coverage will be available at economically justifiable rates if at all  

 

we are subject to risks relating to mechanical failure 

all of our facilities will generally be subject to the risk that operations could be halted for a temporary or extended period of time as the result of casualty forces of nature mechanical failure or extended or extraordinary maintenance among other causes in addition our gaming operations could be damaged or halted due to extreme weather conditions these risks are particularly pronounced at eldorado shreveport’s riverboat and dockside facilities because of their location on and adjacent to water  

we are or may become involved in legal proceedings that if adversely adjudicated or settled could impact our business and financial condition 

from time to time we are named in lawsuits or other legal proceedings relating to our respective businesses in particular the nature of our business subjects us to the risk of lawsuits filed by customers past and present employees competitors business partners and others in the ordinary course of business as with all legal proceedings no assurances can be given as to the outcome of these matters moreover legal proceedings can be expensive and time consuming and we may not be successful in defending or prosecuting these lawsuits which could result in settlements or damages that could significantly impact our business financial condition and results of operations  

our information technology and other systems are subject to cyber security risk including misappropriation of customer information or other breaches of information security 

our operations require that we collect customer data including credit card numbers and other personally identifiable information for various business purposes including marketing and promotional purposes the collection and use of personal data are governed by privacy laws and regulations enacted in the united states and other jurisdictions around the world privacy regulations continue to evolve and on occasion may be inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another compliance with applicable privacy regulations may increase our operating costs andor adversely impact our ability to market our products properties and services to our customers in addition non ‑compliance with applicable privacy regulations by us or in some circumstances non ‑compliance by third parties engaged by us or a breach of security on systems storing our data including due to cyber ‑attack system failure computer virus or unauthorized or fraudulent use by customers employees or employees of third party vendors may result in damage of reputation andor subject us to fines payment of damages lawsuits or restrictions on our use or transfer of data  

our operations have historically been subject to seasonal variations and quarterly fluctuations in operating results and we can expect to experience such variations and fluctuation in the future 

historically our operations have typically been subject to seasonal variations 

our reno nevada properties’ strongest operating results have generally occurred in the second and third quarters and the weakest results have generally occurred during the period from november through february when weather conditions adversely affected operating results in the reno market excessive snowfall during the winter months can make travel to the reno area more difficult this often results in significant declines in traffic on major highways particularly on routes to and from northern california and causes a decline in customer volume furthermore management believes that approximately two ‑thirds of visitors to the reno market arrive by some form of ground transportation 

in addition winter conditions can frequently adversely affect transportation routes to mountaineer presque isle downs and scioto downs and cause cancellations of live horse racing as a result unfavorable seasonal conditions could have a material adverse effect on our operations 

in general it is unlikely that we will be able to obtain business interruption coverage for casualties resulting from severe weather and there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain casualty insurance coverage at affordable rates if at all for casualties resulting from severe weather  

 

because we will be heavily dependent upon hotelcasino and related operations that are conducted in certain limited regions we will be subject to greater risks than a company that is geographically or otherwise more diversified 

our business is heavily dependent upon hotelcasino and related operations that are conducted in three discrete markets as a result we are still subject to a greater degree of risk than a gaming company that has greater geographical diversity the risks to which we have a greater degree of exposure include the following  

• local economic and competitive conditions 

• inaccessibility due to weather conditions road construction or closure of primary access routes 

• changes in local and state governmental laws and regulations including gaming laws and regulations 

• natural and other disasters including earthquakes and flooding 

• a decline in the number of residents in or near or visitors to our operations and 

• a decrease in gaming activities at any of our facilities  

any of the factors outlined above could adversely affect our ability to generate sufficient cash flow to make payments on our outstanding indebtedness  

significant negative industry or economic trends reduced estimates of future cash flows disruptions to our business slower growth rates or lack of growth in our business may cause us to incur impairments to indefinitelived intangible assets or long ‑lived assets 

we test indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually or if a triggering event occurs we will also be required to consider whether the fair values of any of our investments accounted for under the equity method have declined below their carrying value whenever adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate that recorded values may not be recoverable estimated fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis based on estimated future results of the investee and market indicators of the terminal year capitalization rate if any such declines are considered to be other than temporary we will be required to record a write ‑down to estimated fair value  

security concerns terrorist attacks and other geopolitical events could have a material adverse effect on our future operations 

security concerns terrorist attacks and other geopolitical events can have a material adverse effect on leisure and business travel discretionary spending and other areas of economic behavior that directly impact the gaming and entertainment industries in general and our business in particular we cannot predict the extent to which any future security alerts terrorist attacks or other geopolitical events might impact our business results of operations or financial condition  

risks related to the circus renosilver legacy purchase and the merger 

we may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of circus renosilver legacy purchase and the merger and we may encounter difficulties in integrating circus reno silver legacy and the mtr gaming properties with our operations 

our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition of the silver legacy and circus reno will depend to a large extent on our ability to integrate our existing business with those businesses combining independent businesses is a complex costly and time ‑consuming process in addition while we have made significant progress in integrating the operations of mtr gaming into our operations the merger was only recently consummated and completion of the integration of five different properties within a relatively short period of time may create additional challenges as a result we will be required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating the businesses and operations of eldorado mtr gaming the silver legacy and circus reno the integration process may 

 

disrupt the combined business and if implemented ineffectively could preclude the realization of the full benefits of our acquisition transactions in addition we may pursue additional acquisition opportunities in the future which would present further integration challenges our failure to meet the challenges involved in integrating the businesses that we have acquired or propose to acquire or to realize the anticipated benefits of such transactions could cause an interruption of or a loss of momentum in the activities of the company and could adversely affect the company’s results of operations in addition the combined company’s results of operations may not meet our expectations which would then make it difficult to service our outstanding debt obligations 

the overall integration of the businesses may result in unanticipated problems we may encounter unexpected expenses liabilities competitive responses and loss of customer relationships as we integrate the acquired business all of which could divert management’s attention the difficulties of combining the operations of the companies include among others  



















many of these factors will be outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management’s time and energy which could materially impact the business financial condition and results of operations of the company further even if the operations of the businesses of the company mtr gaming silver legacy and circus reno are integrated successfully we may not realize the full benefits of the transactions or the full benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame or at all  

our estimates and judgments related to the acquisition accounting models used to record the purchase price allocation may be inaccurate 

our management will make significant accounting judgments and estimates for the application of acquisition accounting under gaap and the underlying valuation models our business operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted in future periods if our accounting judgments and estimates related to these models prove to be inaccurate  

 

we may be required to recognize impairment charges for other intangible assets 

in accordance with gaap our management periodically assesses our goodwill and other intangible assets to determine if they are impaired significant negative industry or economic trends disruptions to our business inability to effectively integrate acquired businesses unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of the assets divestitures and market capitalization declines may impair goodwill and other intangible assets any charges relating to such impairments would adversely affect results of operations in the periods recognized

significant factors impacting financial results

nevada   a significant portion of our revenues and operating income are generated from patrons who are residents of northern california and as such our operations have been adversely impacted by the growth in native american gaming in northern california many existing native american gaming facilities in northern california are modest compared to the reno triproperties however a number of native american tribes have established large ‑scale gaming facilities in california and some native american tribes have announced that they are in the process of expanding developing or are considering establishing large ‑scale hotel and gaming facilities in northern california as northern california native american gaming operations have expanded we believe the increasing competition generated by these gaming operations has had a negative impact principally on drive ‑in day ‑trip visitor traffic from our main feeder markets in northern california a 320000 square foot gaming facility located in sonoma county california opened on november 5 2013  

louisiana   casino gaming is currently prohibited in several jurisdictions from which the shreveportbossier city market draws customers primarily texas although casino gaming is currently not permitted in texas the texas legislature has from time to time considered proposals to authorize casino gaming and there can be no assurance that casino gaming will not be approved in texas in the future which would have a material adverse effect on our business eldorado shreveport competes with several native american casinos located in oklahoma certain of which are located near our core texas markets because we draw a significant amount of our customers from the dallasfort worth area but are located approximately 190 miles from that area we believe we will continue to face increased competition from gaming operations in oklahoma including the winstar and choctaw casinos and would face significant competition that may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations if casino gaming is approved in texas in june 2013 construction was completed on a 30000 square foot casino and 400 ‑room hotel in bossier city across the red river from eldorado shreveport the facility which also includes several restaurants and a 1000 ‑seat entertainment arena opened on june 15 2013 in december 2014 a new luxury land ‑based casino with 1600 slot machines 72 gaming tables a poker room and a 

 

740 ‑room hotel with a ballroom and spa opened in lake charles louisiana approximately 200 miles south of eldorado shreveport but closer to the houston texas market  

eastern   the mtr gaming properties experience varying competitive pressures from casinos in western pennsylvania western new york northern west virginia and ohio we believe the expansion of gaming in ohio which includes casinos that opened in cleveland in may 2012 and columbus in october 2012 and additional casinos in cincinnati and toledo as well as the installation of vlts at existing horse race tracks near cleveland one of which opened in april 2013 and the other in december 2013 and the relocation of a racetrack to austintown ohio which opened in september 2014 has had and will continue to have a negative impact on our results of operations at all our properties and such impact may be material in order to sustain our market share in the increased competitive environment we continuously reevaluate our advertising strategies and promotional offers to our guests to ensure our reinvestment levels reflect the appropriate level of offerings to sustain our margins

liquidity and capital resources 

the primary sources of liquidity and capital resources have been existing cash cash flow from operations and proceeds from the issuance of debt securities 

 

we expect that our primary capital requirements going forward will relate to the operation and maintenance of our properties and servicing our outstanding indebtedness in 2016 we plan to spend 500 million net of reimbursements from west virginia on qualified capital expenditures 468 million to pay interest on our senior notes and our new credit facility and 43 million for principal payments on our term loan we expect that cash generated from operations will be sufficient to fund our operations and capital requirements and service our outstanding indebtedness for the foreseeable future however we cannot provide assurance that operating cash flows will be sufficient to do so 

eri is a holding company and its only significant assets are ownership interests in its subsidiaries eri’s ability to fund its obligations depends on the cash flow of its subsidiaries and the ability of its subsidiaries to distribute or otherwise make funds available to eri 

at december 31 2015 we had consolidated cash and cash equivalents of 835 million including restricted cash of 53 million at december 31 2014 we had consolidated cash and cash equivalents of 958 million including restricted cash of 82 million 

operating cash flow in 2015 we generated cash flows from operating activities of 567 million as compared to 316 million in 2014 the increase in operating cash was primarily due to the increase in net income during the current year associated with improvements in operations along with incremental cash flow associated with the merger and acquisition combined with various changes in the balance sheet accounts in the normal course of business

net cash used for financing activities in 2014 totaled 142 million and partially consisted of payments totaling 25 million on the resorts credit facility 06 million in distributions representing louisiana state tax payments and an increase in restricted cash of 32 million due to a decrease in funds related to horsemen’s fines and simulcasting funds that are restricted to payments for improving horsemen’s facilities and racing purse at scioto downs 

additionally the repurchase of mtr gaming common stock totaled 50 million and represented the amount paid in cash by holdco upon closing of the merger in 2014 an additional 300 million of mtr gaming common stock was purchased by mtr gaming upon closing of the merger and was reflected as a reduction of the net cash acquired under investing activities also during 2014 mtr gaming used 110 million to repurchase 100 million in aggregate principal amount of mtr senior lien notes at a price of 11025 per 100 in principal amount of the purchased notes  

capital expenditures 

during the year ended december 31 2015 additions to property and equipment primarily slot machines and other capital projects aggregated 319 million which included 51 million in nevada 44 million in louisiana 219 million attributable to the eastern properties net of 39 million in west virginia reimbursements and 05 million at corporate 

under legislation approved by west virginia in july 2011 mountaineer participates in a modernization fund which provides for reimbursement from amounts paid to the west virginia lottery commission in an amount equal to 

 

1 for each 2 expended for certain qualifying capital expenditures having a useful life of more than three years and placed into service after july 1 2011 qualifying capital expenditures include the purchase of slot machines and related equipment to the extent such slot machines are retained by mountaineer at its west virginia location for not less than five years any unexpended balance from a given fiscal year will be available for one additional fiscal year after which time the remaining unused balance carried forward will be forfeited as of december 31 2015 mountaineer remains eligible for 30 million under annual modernization fund grants that expire in varying dates through june 30 2017 we can make no assurances mountaineer will be able to make qualifying capital expenditures purchases sufficient to receive reimbursement of the available funds prior to their expiration nor that the modernization funds will continue to be available 

we anticipate spending up to a total of 50 million on capital expenditures during 2016

other liquidity matters 

the pennsylvania gaming control board the “pgcb” the pennsylvania department of revenue and the pennsylvania state police collectively “the borrowers” were required to fund the costs they incurred in connection with the initial development of the infrastructure to support gaming operations in pennsylvania as well as the initial ongoing costs of the borrowers the initial funding of these costs was provided from a loan from the pennsylvania general fund in the amount of 361 million and further funding was provided from additional loans from the pennsylvania property tax reserve fund in the aggregate amount of 638 million 

the pennsylvania department of revenue will assess all licensees including presque isle downs their proportionate share of amounts represented by the borrowings which are in the aggregate amount of 999 million once the designated number of pennsylvania’s slot machine licensees is operational on july 11 2011 the pgcb issued an administrative order which established that payments associated with the 638 million that was borrowed from the property tax reserve fund would commence on january 1 2012 the repayment allocation between all current licensees is based upon equal weighting of i cumulative gross slot revenue since inception in relation to the combined cumulative gross slot revenue for all licensees and ii single year gross slot revenue during the state’s fiscal year ending june 30 in relation to the combined single year gross slot revenue for all licensees and amounts paid each year will be adjusted annually based upon changes in the licensee’s proportionate share of gross slot revenue we have estimated that our total proportionate share of the aggregate 638 million to be assessed to the gaming facilities will be 41 million and will be paid quarterly over a ten ‑year period which began effective january 1 2012 for the 361 million that was borrowed from the general fund payment is scheduled to begin after all fourteen licensees are operational although we cannot determine when payment will begin we have considered a similar repayment model for the general fund 

 

borrowings and estimated that our total proportionate share of the aggregate 361 million to all fourteen gaming facilities will be 21 million 

the recorded estimate is subject to revision based upon future changes in the revenue assumptions utilized to develop the estimate our estimated total obligation at december 31 2015 is 43 million the company paid 04 million during the year ended december 31 2015

business combinations 

the company applied the provisions of accounting standards codification “asc” topic 805 “business combinations” in the accounting for the circus renosilver legacy purchase and the merger it required us to recognize the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair values goodwill as of the acquisition date was measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed while we used our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date our estimates were inherently uncertain and subject to refinement as a result during the measurement period which may be up to one year from the acquisition date we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill upon the final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed any subsequent adjustments will be recorded in our consolidated statements of operations 

accounting for business combinations required our management to make significant estimates and assumptions including our estimate of intangible assets such as gaming licenses trade names and loyalty programs although we believe the assumptions and estimates made have been reasonable and appropriate they are inherently uncertain for our gaming license valuation our properties estimated future cash flows were the primary assumption in the respective intangible valuations cash flow estimates included assumptions regarding factors such as recent and budgeted operating performance net win per unit revenue patron visits and growth percentages the growth percentages were developed considering general macroeconomic conditions as well as competitive impacts from current and anticipated competition through a review of customer market data operating margins and current regulatory social and economic climates the most significant of the assumptions used in the valuations included 1 revenue growthdecline percentages 2 discount rates 3 effective income tax rates 4 future terminal values and 5 capital expenditure assumptions these assumptions were developed for each of our properties based on historical trends in the current competitive markets in which they operate and projections of future performance and competition the primary assumptions with respect to our trade names and loyalty program intangibles primary assumptions were selecting the appropriate royalty rates and cost estimates for replacement cost analyses  

in addition uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed in connection with a business combination are initially estimated as of the business combination date the company reevaluated these items quarterly based upon facts and circumstances that existed as of the business combination date with any adjustments to our preliminary estimates being recorded to goodwill if identified within the measurement period subsequent to the measurement period or our final determination of the tax allowance’s or contingency’s estimated value whichever comes first changes to these uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances will affect our provision for 

 

income taxes in our consolidated statement of operations and could have material impact on our results of operations and financial position  

accounting for unconsolidated affiliates 

the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company and its subsidiaries investments in unconsolidated affiliates which are 50 or less owned and do not meet the consolidation criteria of asc 810 “consolidation” are accounted for under the equity method all intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation certain amendments of asc 810 became effective for us beginning january 1 2010 such amendments include changes to the quantitative approach to determine the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity “vie” an enterprise must determine if its variable interest or interests give it a controlling financial interest in a vie by evaluating whether 1 the enterprise has the power to direct activities of the vie that have a significant effect on economic performance and 2 the enterprise has an obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the vie the amendments to asc 810 also require ongoing reassessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a vie the company believes the adoption of these amendments did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 

the company considers whether the fair values of any of its equity method investments have declined below their carrying value whenever adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate that recorded values may not be recoverable if the company considers any such decline to be other than temporary then a write ‑down would be recorded to the estimated fair value estimated fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis based on estimated future results of the investee and market indicators of terminal year capitalization rate  

revenue recognition 

gaming revenues consist of the net win from gaming activities which is the difference between amounts wagered and amounts paid to winning patrons and is recognized at the time wagers are made net of winning payouts to patrons base and progressive jackpots are accrued and charged to revenue at the time the obligation to pay the jackpot is established pari ‑mutuel commissions consist of commissions earned from thoroughbred and harness racing and importing of simulcast signals from other race tracks pari ‑mutuel commissions are recognized at the time wagers are made such commissions are a designated portion of the wagering handle as determined by state racing commissions and are shown net of the taxes assessed by state and local agencies as well as purses and other contractual amounts paid to horsemen associations we recognize revenues from fees earned through the exporting of simulcast signals to other race tracks at the time wagers are made such fees are based upon a predetermined percentage of handle as contracted with the other race tracks revenues from food and beverage are recognized at the time of sale and revenues from lodging are recognized on the date of stay other revenues are recorded at the time services are rendered or merchandise sold we offer certain promotional allowances to our customers including complimentary lodging food and beverage and promotional credits for free play on slot machines the retail value of these promotional items is shown as a reduction in total revenues on our consolidated statements of operations  

income taxes 

the company and its subsidiaries file us federal income tax returns and various state and local income tax returns the company does not have tax sharing agreements with the other members within the consolidated eri group with few exceptions the company is no longer subject to us federal or state and local tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2012 

for the year ended december 31 2014 the difference between the effective rate and the statutory rate is attributed primarily to the federal and state valuation allowances on the company’s deferred tax assets as a result of the company’s net operating losses and net deferred tax asset position as of december 31 2014 after exclusion of certain deferred tax liabilities that generally cannot be offset against deferred tax assets known as “naked credits” the company provided for a full valuation allowance against substantially all of the net federal and the net state deferred tax assets 

 

for the year ended december 31 2015 the difference between the effective rate and the statutory rate is attributable primarily to the release of a majority of the federal and related state valuation allowances on the company’s deferred tax assets the company continues to provide for a valuation allowance against net federal and state deferred tax assets associated with nonoperating land the sale of which could result in capital losses that can only be offset against capital gains the company also continues to provide for a valuation allowance against net state deferred tax assets relating to operations in pennsylvania and west virginia management determined it was not morelikelythannot that the company will realize these net deferred tax assets 

a valuation allowance is recognized if based on the weight of available evidence it is morelikelythannot that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized management must analyze all available positive and negative evidence regarding realization of the deferred tax assets and make an assessment of the likelihood of sufficient future taxable income for the year ended december 31 2014 the company was in a threeyear cumulative loss position which was significant negative evidence and the company did not have positive evidence to outweigh the negative evidence for the year ended december 31 2015 management has considered all available positive and negative evidence and concluded it is morelikelythannot to realize its federal louisiana and city of columbus ohio deferred tax assets with the exception of nonoperating land the company will continue to evaluate the realization of its deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis and make adjustments to its valuation allowance as appropriate 

for income tax purposes the company amortizes or depreciates certain assets that have been assigned an indefinite life for book purposes for the year ended december 31 2014 the incremental amortization or depreciation deductions for income tax purposes resulted in an increase in certain deferred tax liabilities that could not be used as a source of future taxable income for purposes of measuring the company’s need for a valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets therefore the company recorded non ‑cash deferred tax expense of 11 million as the company amortized these assets for tax purposes 

prior to the merger date holdco was taxed as a partnership under the internal revenue code pursuant to which income taxes were primarily the responsibility of the partners the company is a c corporation subject to the federal and state corporate ‑level income taxes at prevailing corporate tax rates while taxed as a partnership holdco was not subject to federal income tax liability because holders of membership interests in holdco were required to include their respective shares of holdco’s taxable income including that of resorts in their individual income tax returns distributions were made to their respective members to cover such tax liabilities such distributions were subject to limitation in accordance with the provisions of their respective operating agreements eldorado shreveport 2 llc has elected as a single member limited liability company to be taxed as a c corporation current and deferred income taxes associated with eldorado shreveport 2 llc were not material 

under the applicable accounting standards we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more ‑likely ‑than ‑not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement the accounting standards also provide guidance on de ‑recognition classification interest and penalties on income taxes accounting in interim periods and disclosure requirements for uncertain tax positions we have recorded no liability associated with uncertain tax positions at december 31 2015 and 2014  

property and equipment and other long ‑lived assets 

property and equipment is recorded at cost except for the silver legacy circus reno and the mtr gaming properties which were adjusted for fair value under asc 805 and are depreciated over their remaining estimated useful life or lease term judgments are made in determining estimated useful lives and salvage values of these assets the accuracy of these estimates affects the amount of depreciation expense recognized in our financial results and whether we have a gain or loss on the disposal of assets we review depreciation estimates and methods as new events occur more experience is acquired and additional information is obtained that would possibly change our current estimates 

property equipment and other long ‑lived assets are assessed for impairment in accordance with asc 360— property  plant  and equipment  the company evaluates its long ‑lived assets periodically for impairment issues or 

 

more frequently whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable recoverability of these assets is determined by comparing the net carrying value to the sum of the estimated future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by these assets the amount of impairment loss if any is measured by the difference between the net carrying value and the estimated fair value of the asset which is typically measured using a discounted cash flow model level 3 of the fair value hierarchy for assets to be disposed of impairment is recognized based on the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs of disposal as estimated based on comparable asset sales offers received or a discounted cash flow model based on the results of our periodic reviews we have not recorded any impairment losses during the years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 

for undeveloped properties including non ‑operating real properties when indicators of impairment are present properties are evaluated for impairment and losses are recorded when undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by an asset or market comparisons are less than the asset’s carrying amount the amount of the impairment loss is calculated as the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its fair value which is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis management estimates or market comparisons the fair value measurements employed for our impairment evaluations which are subject to the assumptions and factors as previously discussed were generally based on a review of comparable activities in the marketplace which falls within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy  

goodwill and other indefinite ‑lived intangible assets 

goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price paid over the fair value of the net assets of the acquired business intangible assets acquired in business combinations are recorded based upon their fair value at the date of acquisition goodwill and other indefinite ‑lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment annually during the fourth quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired 

goodwill is tested by comparing the carrying value of the reporting unit to its fair value the company estimates the fair value of the reporting unit utilizing income and market approaches the income approach is based on projected future cash flow that is discounted to present value using factors that consider the timing and risk of the future cash flows the market approach is based on the company’s market capitalization at the testing date the aggregate carrying value of the company’s goodwill was 668 million as of december 31 2015 the company did not have goodwill prior to the merger date 

our indefinite ‑lived intangible assets consist of racing and gaming licenses trade names and loyalty programs and are evaluated for impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying value any excess of carrying value over the fair value is recognized as an impairment within the consolidated statement of operations in the period of review 

the gaming and racing licenses of each property were valued in aggregate for each respective property as these licenses are considered to be the most significant asset of the properties and the gaming licenses could not be obtained without holding the racing licenses therefore a market participant would consider the licenses in aggregate the fair value of the licenses is calculated using an excess earnings methodology which is an income approach methodology that allocates the projected cash flows of the property to the gaming license intangible assets less charges for the use of the other identifiable assets of the property including working capital fixed assets and other intangible assets we believe this methodology is appropriate as the gaming licenses are the primary asset to the properties the licenses are linked to each respective facility and it’s the lowest level at which discrete cash flows can be directly attributable to the assets under the gaming legislation applicable to our properties licenses are property specific and can only be acquired if a buyer acquires the existing facility because existing licenses may not be acquired and transferred for use at a different facility the estimated future cash flows of each of our properties was the primary assumption in the valuation of such property the aggregate carrying value of the company’s gaming license intangibles approximated 4821 million as of december 31 2015 

assessing the indefinite ‑lived intangible assets for impairment is a process that requires significant judgment and involves detailed quantitative and qualitative business ‑specific analysis and many individual assumptions which fluctuate between assessments our properties’ estimated future cash flows are a primary assumption in the respective impairment analyses unforeseen events changes in circumstances and market conditions and material differences in 

 

estimates of future cash flows could negatively affect the fair value of our assets and result in an impairment charge which could be material cash flow estimates include assumptions regarding factors such as recent and budgeted operating performance net win per unit revenue patron visits growth percentages which are developed considering general macroeconomic conditions as well as competitive impacts from current and anticipated competition through a review of customer market data operating margins and current regulatory social and economic climates these estimates could also be negatively impacted by changes in federal state or local regulations economic downturns or developments and other market conditions affecting travel and access to the properties the most significant of the assumptions used in our valuations include 1 revenue growthdecline percentages 2 discount rates 3 effective income tax rates 4 future terminal values and 5 capital expenditure assumptions these assumptions were developed for each property based on historical trends the current competitive markets in which they operate and projections of future performance and competition 

the company values trade names using the relief ‑from ‑royalty method royalty rates range from 05 ‑ 10 the loyalty program was valued using a combination of a replacement cost and lost profits analysis trade names are amortized on a straight ‑line basis over a 35 year useful life and the loyalty program is being amortized on a straight ‑line basis over a one year useful life the aggregate carrying value of trade names and loyalty program intangibles as of december 31 2015 was 98 million and 77 million respectively 

we believe we have used reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the fair value of our other indefinite ‑lived intangible assets however these estimates and assumptions could be materially different from actual results if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected or if events occur or circumstances change that would reduce the fair value of our licensing intangibles below the carrying value reflected on the consolidated balance sheet we may be required to conduct an interim test or possibly recognize impairment charges which may be material in future periods 

no impairment charges were recorded for our other indefinite ‑lived intangible assets in any of the years presented 

reserve for uncollectible accounts receivable 

we reserve an estimated amount for receivables that may not be collected methodologies for estimating bad debt reserves range from specific reserves to various percentages applied to aged receivables historical collection rates are considered as are customer relationships in determining specific reserves as with many estimates management must make judgments about potential actions by third parties in establishing and evaluating our reserves for bad debts 

self ‑insurance reserves 

the company is self ‑insured for various levels of general liability employee medical insurance coverage and workers’ compensation coverage self ‑insurance reserves are estimated based on the company’s claims experience and are included in accrued other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets at december 31 2015 and 2014 accrued insurance and medical claims reserves were 35 million and 13 million respectively  

loyalty program 

we offer programs whereby our participating patrons can accumulate points for wagering that can be redeemed for credits for free play on slot machines lodging food and beverage merchandise and in limited situations cash based upon the estimated redemptions of loyalty program points an estimated liability is established for the cost of redemption on earned but unredeemed points the estimated cost of redemption utilizes estimates and assumptions of the mix of the various product offerings for which the points will be redeemed and costs of such product offerings changes in the programs membership levels and redemption patterns of our participating patrons can impact this liability the aggregate outstanding liability for the loyalty program was 34 million and 24 million at december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively and is included as a component of other accrued liabilities in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets 

 

litigation claims and assessments 

we utilize estimates for litigation claims and assessments these estimates are based on our knowledge and experience regarding current and past events as well as assumptions about future events if our assessment of such a matter should change we may have to change the estimates which may have an adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows actual results could differ from these estimates  

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

in february 2016 the fasb issued an accounting standards update which addresses the recognition and measurement of leases under the new guidance for all leases with the exception of shortterm leases at the commencement date lessees will be required to recognize a lease liability which is a lessees obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease measured on a discounted basis and a rightofuse asset which is an asset that represents the lessees right to use or control the use of a specified asset for the lease term under the new guidance lessor accounting is largely unchanged further the new lease guidance simplifies the accounting for sale and leaseback transactions primarily because lessees must recognize lease assets and liabilities which no longer provides a source for off balance sheet financing the effective date for this update is for the annual and interim periods beginning after december 15 2018 with early adoption permitted lessees and lessors must apply a modified retrospective transition approach for leases existing at or entered into after the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this accounting standard on our consolidated financial statements 

in november 2015 the fasb issued asu 201517 “income taxes—balance sheet classification of deferred taxes” which eliminates the guidance in topic 740 income taxes that required an entity to separate deferred tax liabilities and assets between current and noncurrent amounts in a classified balance sheet the amendment require that all deferred tax liabilities and assets of the same tax jurisdiction or a tax filing group as well as any related valuation allowance be offset and presented as a single noncurrent amount in a classified balance sheet the amendment is effective for annual periods beginning after december 15 2016 early application is permitted the guidance may be applied either prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively to all periods presented the company applied this guidance in the accompanying consolidated financial statements with prospective application effective october 1 2015 

in september 2015 the fasb issued asu 201516 business combinations topic 805 simplifying the accounting for measurementperiod adjustments asu 201516 eliminates the requirement that an acquirer in a business combination account for measurementperiod adjustments retrospectively instead an acquirer will recognize a measurementperiod adjustment during the period in which it determines the amount of the adjustment the guidance is effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2015 and interim periods within those fiscal years for all other entities it is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2016 we are evaluating the effects if any that the adoption of this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements 

in july 2015 the fasb issued asu 201511 “simplifying the measurement of inventory” which requires that inventory within the scope of asu 201511 be measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value inventory measured using lastin firstout lifo and the retail inventory method are not impacted by the new guidance asu 201511 applies to all other inventory which includes inventory that is measured using firstin firstout fifo or average cost an entity should measure inventory within the scope of asu 201511 at the lower of cost and net realizable value net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business less reasonably predictable costs of completion disposal and transportation asu 201511 is effective for annual periods beginning after december 15 2016 early adoption is permitted we are currently evaluating the impact on our financial statements and disclosures 

in april 2015 the fasb issued an accounting standards update which changes the presentation of debt issuance costs in financial statements under the new standard an entity presents such costs in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the related debt liability rather than as an asset the amortization of the costs is reported as interest expense in august 2015 the fasb issued an accounting standards update which clarifies that companies may continue 

 

to present unamortized debt issuance costs associated with line of credit arrangements as an asset the new guidance should be applied on a retrospective basis wherein the balance sheet of each individual period should be adjusted to reflect the periodspecific effects of applying the new guidance the effective dates for these updates were for the annual and interim periods beginning after december 15 2015 we elected to early adopt this guidance during the third quarter of 2015 

in january 2015 the fasb issued asu no 2015 ‑1 “income statement—extraordinary and unusual items” subtopic 225 ‑20 which eliminates the concept of accounting of extraordinary items previously defined as items that are both unusual and infrequent which were reported as a separate item on the income statement net of tax after income from continuing operations the elimination of this concept is intended to simplify accounting for unusual items and more closely align with international accounting practices this amendment is effective for annual periods ending after december 15 2015 and for subsequent interim and annual periods thereafter early adoption is permitted we believe that the effects if any of the adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

in august 2014 the fasb issued asu no 2014 ‑15 “presentation of financial statements—going concern” subtopic 205 ‑40 which amends the current guidance in asc topic 205 by adding subtopic 40 subtopic 40 requires management to evaluate whether there are conditions or events that in aggregate would raise substantial doubt about an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern for one year from the date the financial statements are issued or available to be issued if substantial doubt existed management would be required to make certain disclosures related to nature of the substantial doubt and under certain circumstances how that substantial doubt would be mitigated this amendment is effective for annual periods ending after december 15 2016 and for subsequent interim and annual periods thereafter early adoption is permitted we are currently evaluating the effects if any adoption of this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements 

in june 2014 the fasb issued an accounting standards update with respect to performance share awards this accounting standards update requires that a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition as such the performance target should not be reflected in estimating the grant date fair value of the award this update further clarifies that compensation cost should be recognized in the period in which it becomes probable that the performance target will be achieved and should represent the compensation cost attributable to the period or periods for which the requisite service has already been rendered the effective date for this update is for the annual and interim periods beginning after december 15 2015 early adoption is permitted we do not believe that the adoption of this accounting standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

in may 2014 the fasb issued accounting standards update “asu” no 2014 ‑9 “revenue from contracts with customers” which provides guidance for revenue recognition the new standard outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance including industry ‑specific guidance the core principle of the revenue model is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services the standard is designed to create greater comparability for financial statement users across industries and jurisdictions and also requires enhanced disclosures the guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december 15 2017 early adoption is permitted for annual and interim periods beginning after december 15 2016 we are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of asu 2014 ‑09 on our consolidated financial statements  

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices such as interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily from variable rate long ‑term debt arrangements at december 31 2015 interest on borrowings under our new credit facility was subject to fluctuation based on changes in shortterm interest rates 

 

the company evaluates its exposure to market risk by monitoring interest rates in the marketplace and has on occasion utilized derivative financial instruments to help manage this risk the company does not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading purposes there were no material quantitative changes in our market risk exposure or how such risks are managed for the year ended december 31 2015 

the following table provides information as of december 31 2015 about our debt obligations including debt that is sensitive to changes in interest rates and presents principal payments and related weightedaverage interest rates by expected maturity dates implied forward rates should not be considered a predictor of actual future interest rates 

the scheduled maturities of our longterm debt outstanding for the years ending december 31 are as follows 



  

as of december 31 2015 borrowings outstanding under our new revolving credit facility were longterm variablerate borrowings assuming a 100 basispoint increase in libor in the case of term loan b over the 1 floor specified in our credit agreement our annual interest cost would change by 42 million based on gross amounts outstanding at december 31 2015

 item 9a controls and procedures 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

we have established and maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports that we file under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “exchange act” is recorded processed summarized evaluated and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the sec and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

in designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures management recognizes that any controls and procedures no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives and management necessarily is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost ‑benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures  

 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a ‑15e and 15d ‑15e of the exchange act for eldorado resorts inc and subsidiaries 

our chief executive officer and chief financial officer evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in exchange act rules 13a ‑15e and 15d ‑15e as of the end of the period covered by this form 10 ‑k annual report the “evaluation date” they have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized evaluated and reported within the time periods specified in sec rules and forms 

in making our assessment of changes in internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2015 we have excluded the acquired silver legacy and circus reno operations because these operations were acquired in a business combination on november 24 2015 these operations represent 1936 million and 273 million respectively of our total assets and 1321 million and 199 million respectively of our total net assets as of december 31 2015 these operations represent 135 million and 83 million respectively of our total net revenues and 01 million and 15 million respectively of our net income for the year ended december 31 2015 

ernst  young llp an independent registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2015 which report follows below  

changes in internal controls 

as further discussed in our quarterly report on form 10q filed on november 9 2015 we identified a material weakness in our controls over the accounting for a debt refinancing transaction specifically subsequent to the issuance of our earnings release and as part of completing our financial statement close process for our quarterly report we determined we did not properly account for a debt transaction which resulted in the reporting of an incorrect amount of loss on the transaction in our earnings release for the quarter the accounting for the transaction was correct in the quarterly report additionally we had a design deficiency in our controls as we did not have sufficiently robust control s in place to ensure satisfactory completion of our financial statement close process prior to the issuance of our earnings release 

to remediate this material weakness we implemented additional controls related to activities that must be completed in the financial statement close process prior to the issuance of our earnings release implemented additional control criteria that drive the use of third party specialists for significant transactions and hired additional corporate accounting staff and tax personnel the audit committee has reviewed and monitored these remediation measures we believe these actions have remediated the material weakness identified and have strengthened our internal control over financial reporting 

during the quarter ended december 31 2015 there were no significant changes in our internal control over financial reporting other than those referred to above that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting  

 

report of independent registered public accounting firm 

the board of directors and shareholders 

eldorado resorts inc 

we have audited eldorado resorts inc’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2015 based on criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 2013 framework the “ coso criteria ”  eldorado resorts inc’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying management’s report on internal control over financial reporting included in item 9a our responsibility is to express an opinion on the companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

as indicated in the accompanying management’s report on internal control over financial reporting management’s assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of circus and eldorado joint venture dba silver legacy resort casino and circus circus reno which are included in the 2015 consolidated financial statements of eldorado resorts inc and constituted 2209 million and 1520 million of total and net assets respectively as of december 31 2015 and 218 million and 16 million of net revenues and net income respectively for the year then ended our audit of internal control over financial reporting of eldorado resorts inc also did not include an evaluation of internal control over financial reporting of circus and eldorado joint venture dba silver legacy resort casino and circus circus reno 

in our opinion eldorado resorts inc maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2015 based on the coso criteria 

we also have audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the consolidated balance sheets of eldorado resorts inc as of december 31 2015 and 2014 and the related consolidated statements of operations comprehensive income loss stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2015 and our report dated march 15 2016 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon

the gaming industry includes landbased casinos dockside casinos riverboat casinos casinos located on native american reservations and other forms of legalized gaming there is intense competition among companies in the gaming industry many of which have significantly greater resources than we do certain states have legalized casino gaming and other states may legalize gaming in the future legalized casino gaming in these states and on native american reservations near our markets or changes to gaming laws in states surrounding nevada louisiana west virginia pennsylvania or ohio could increase competition and could adversely affect our operations we also compete to a lesser extent with gaming facilities in other jurisdictions with dockside gaming facilities state sponsored lotteries onandoff track parimutuel wagering card clubs riverboat casinos and other forms of legalized gambling in addition various forms of internet gaming have been approved in nevada and new jersey and legislation permitting internet gaming has been proposed by the federal government and other states the expansion of internet gaming in nevada and other jurisdictions could result in significant additional competition 

eldorado shreveport the shreveportbossier city louisiana gaming market is characterized by intense competition and the market has not grown appreciably since eldorado shreveport opened in december 2000 we compete directly with five casinos all but one of which have operated in the shreveportbossier city market for several years and have established customer bases in addition we also compete with the slot machine facility at harrahs louisiana casino and racetrack located in bossier city and winstar casino and casino facilities owned by the choctaw nation located in oklahoma casino gaming is currently prohibited in several jurisdictions from which the shreveportbossier city market draws customers primarily texas the texas legislature has from time to time considered proposals to legalize gaming any such proposal would require an amendment to the texas state constitution which requires approval by twothirds of the texas state legislature and approval by a majority of votes cast in a statewide voter referendum such approvals would legalize gaming in texas notwithstanding vetoes by the governor of casino gambling bills there can be no assurance that casino gaming will not be approved in texas in the future which would have a material adverse effect on our business eldorado shreveport competes with several native american casinos located in oklahoma certain of which are located near our core texas markets winstar casinos a las vegasstyle gaming facility owned by the chickasaw nation is located in oklahoma approximately 60 miles north of the dallasfort worth area and has 500000 square feet of gaming space more than 7400 electronic gaming devices 88 table games 46 poker tables a 937seat bingo hall an event center two hotel towers with over 1500 rooms a spa and a 27hole golf course eldorado shreveport also competes with choctaw casino resort a casino and hotel facility owned by the choctaw nation and located in durant oklahoma approximately 75 miles north of the dallasfort worth area with approximately 3500 electronic gaming devices table games 30 poker tables a bingo hall hotel 5500seat capacity event center an 1000seat concert hall several restaurants a buffet amphitheater dance hall spa and rv park both the chickasaw nation and the choctaw nation are permitted to operate classiii as set forth in the indian gaming regulatory act gaming devices in the state of oklahoma which permits them to offer las vegasstyle gaming because eldorado shreveport draws a significant amount of customers from the dallasfort worth texas area but is located approximately 190 miles from that area we believe we will continue to face increased competition from gaming operations in oklahoma including the winstar and choctaw casinos and would face significant competition that may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations if casino gaming were to be approved in texas 

in june 2013 construction was completed on a new 30000 square foot casino and 400room hotel in bossier city across the red river from eldorado shreveport the facility which also includes several restaurants and a 1000seat entertainment arena received final approval from the louisiana gaming control board and opened on june 15 2013 the owner acquired the license for an existing casino site in lake charles louisiana and received the required regulatory approvals to move the location to bossier city in december 2014 a new luxury landbased casino with 1600 slot machines 72 gaming tables a poker room and a 740room hotel with a ballroom spa and 18hole golf course opened in lake charles louisiana approximately 200 miles south of eldorado shreveport but closer to the houston texas market 

eldorado reno of the 31 casinos currently operating in the reno market we believe we compete principally with the six other hotelcasinos that like eldorado reno and silver legacy each generate at least 36 million in annual gaming revenues at this time we cannot predict the extent to which new and proposed projects will be undertaken or the extent to which current hotel andor casino space may be expanded we expect that any additional rooms added in the reno market will increase competition for visitor revenue there can be no assurance that any growth in renos current room base or gaming capacity will not adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 

we also compete with hotelcasinos located in the nearby lake tahoe region as well as those in other areas of nevada including las vegas a substantial number of customers travel to both reno and the lake tahoe area during their visits consequently we believe that our success is influenced to some degree by the success of the lake tahoe market the number of visitors increased during the year ended december 31 2014 compared with the prior year and while we do not anticipate a significant change in the popularity of either reno or lake tahoe as tourist destination areas in the foreseeable future any decline could adversely affect our operations 

since visitors from california comprise a significant portion of our customer base we also compete with native american gaming operations in california in total the state of california has signed and ratified compacts with 72 native american tribes and there are currently 60 native american casinos operating in california including casinos located in northern california which we consider to be a significant target market these native american tribes are allowed to operate slot machines lottery games and banking and percentage games on native american lands although many existing native american gaming facilities in northern california are modest compared to eldorado reno and silver legacy a number of native american tribes have established largescale gaming facilities in california and some native american tribes have announced that they are in the process of expanding developing or are considering establishing largescale hotel and gaming facilities in northern california offreservation proposals for tribal gaming in northern california continue to face resistance at the federal and local levels 

under their current compacts most native american tribes in california may operate up to 2000 slot machines and up to two gaming facilities may be operated on any one reservation however under action taken by the national indian gaming commission gaming devices similar in appearance to slot machines but which are deemed to be technological enhancements to bingo style gaming are not subject to such limits and may be used by tribes without state permission the number of slot machines the tribes are allowed to operate may increase as a result of any new or amended compacts the tribes may enter into with the state of california that receive the requisite approvals such as has been the case with respect to a number of new or amended compacts which have been executed and approved 

management believes the reno market draws over 50 of its visitors from california as northern california native american gaming operations have expanded we believe the increasing competition generated by these gaming operations has negatively impacted and may continue to negatively impact principally drivein daytrip visitor traffic from our main feeder markets in northern california a new gaming facility located in sonoma county california opened on november 5 2013 with 3000 slot machines 144 table games multiple dining options and a 10000 square foot events center in addition to gaming on native americanowned land california allows other noncasino style gaming including parimutuel wagering a state sponsored lottery card clubs bingo and offtrack betting 

mtr gaming properties mountaineer presque isle downs and scioto downs primarily compete with gaming facilities located in west virginia ohio and pennsylvania including to a certain extent each other and gaming locations located in neighboring states including new york indiana and michigan in particular mountaineer and to a lesser extent presque isle downs competes with other gaming facilities located in pennsylvania including the rivers casino located in downtown pittsburgh pennsylvania and the meadows racetrack and casino located in washington pennsylvania approximately 50 miles southeast of mountaineer an additional license has been granted for a casino to be located in lawrence county pennsylvania approximately 45 miles from mountaineer and 90 miles from presque isle downs which would result in further competition for both of those properties further gaming facilities in ohio that have recently commenced operations including the horseshoe casino cleveland hollywood casino columbus thistledown racino northfield park and beulah park present significant competition for mountaineer presque isle downs and scioto downs

governmental gaming regulations 

the gaming and racing industries are highly regulated and we must maintain our licenses and pay gaming taxes to continue our operations we are subject to extensive regulation under laws rules and supervisory procedures primarily in the jurisdictions where our facilities are located or docked these laws rules and regulations generally concern the responsibility financial stability and characters of the owners managers and persons with financial interests in the gaming operations if additional gaming regulations are adopted in a jurisdiction in which we operate such regulations could impose restrictions or costs that could have a significant adverse effect on us from time to time various proposals have been introduced in legislatures of jurisdictions in which we have operations that if enacted could adversely affect the tax regulatory operational or other aspects of the gaming industry and us we do not know whether or when such legislation will be enacted gaming companies are currently subject to significant state and local taxes and fees in addition to normal federal and state corporate income taxes and such taxes and fees are subject to increase at any time any material increase in these taxes or fees could adversely affect us 

some jurisdictions including those in which we are licensed empower their regulators to investigate participation by licensees in gaming outside their jurisdiction and require access to periodic reports respecting those gaming activities violations of laws in one jurisdiction could result in disciplinary action in other jurisdictions 

under provisions of gaming laws in jurisdictions in which we have operations and under our organizational documents certain of our securities are subject to restriction on ownership which may be imposed by specified governmental authorities the restrictions may require a holder of our securities to dispose of the securities or if the holder refuses or is unable to dispose of the securities we may be required to repurchase the securities

the internal revenue service requires operators of casinos located in the united states to file information returns for us citizens including names and addresses of winners for keno bingo and slot machine winnings in excess of stipulated amounts the internal revenue service also requires operators to withhold taxes on some keno bingo and slot machine winnings of nonresident aliens we are unable to predict the extent to which these requirements if extended might impede or otherwise adversely affect operations of andor income from the other games 

regulations adopted by the financial crimes enforcement network of the treasury department fincen and the nevada gaming authorities require the reporting of currency transactions in excess of 10000 occurring within a gaming day including identification of the patron by name and social security number this reporting obligation began in may 1985 and may have resulted in the loss of gaming revenues to jurisdictions outside the united states which are exempt from the ambit of these regulations in addition to currency transaction reporting requirements suspicious financial activity is also required to be reported to fincen

 item 1a risk factors 

risks related to eris capital structure and equity ownership 

we have significant indebtedness 

as a result of our existing credit facilities and outstanding secured notes we have a significant amount of indebtedness the companys consolidated outstanding aggregate principal amount of notes as of december 31 2014 was 7287 million mtr gamings 5607 million outstanding aggregate principal amount of second lien notes is secured by substantially all assets of mtr gaming resorts 1680 million outstanding aggregate principal amount of senior notes are secured by substantially all assets of resorts this indebtedness may have important negative consequences for us including 

• limiting our ability to satisfy our obligations • increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions • limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in its businesses and the markets in which we operates • placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors that have less debt • increasing our vulnerability to and limiting our ability to react to changing market conditions changes in our industry and economic downturns • limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund working capital requirements capital expenditures debt service general corporate or other obligations • subjecting us to a number of restrictive covenants that among other things limit our ability to pay dividends and distributions make acquisitions and dispositions borrow additional funds and make capital expenditures and other investments • restrictions on making dividend payments and other payments by whollyowned subsidiaries • limiting our ability to use operating cash flow in other areas of its business because we must dedicate a significant portion of these funds to make principal andor interest payments on its outstanding debt • exposing us to interest rate risk due to the variable interest rate on borrowings under our credit facility • causing our failure to comply with the financial and restrictive covenants contained in our current or future indebtedness which could cause a default under such indebtedness and which if not cured or waived could have a material adverse effect on us and • affecting our ability to renew gaming and other licenses necessary to conduct our business our ability to make payments of the principal and interest on and refinance our indebtedness will depend on our future performance our ability to generate cash flow and market conditions each of which is subject to economic financial competitive and other factors beyond our control our business may be unable to continue to generate cash flow from operations sufficient to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures in addition because mtr and resorts have separate debt facilities that limit their ability to distribute cash we will be limited in our ability to move funds from one entity to another to finance debt obligations capital expenditures or other liquidity needs if mtr or resorts is unable to generate such cash flow or contribute or distribute cash to finance the liquidity needs of eri or each other eri mtr or resorts as applicable may be required to adopt one or more alternatives such as selling assets restructuring debt undertaking additional borrowings or issuing additional debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive the failure to comply with the terms of our indebtedness could result in an event of default 

which if not cured or waived could have a material negative effect on us our ability to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets the credit markets and our financial condition at such time we may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms which could result in increased financing costs or a default on our debt obligations 

our indentures contain and future debt agreements may contain covenants that could significantly restrict our operations 

the agreements governing our indebtedness contain and any of our future debt agreements might contain numerous covenants imposing financial and operating restrictions on our business these restrictions might affect our ability to operate our business might limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise and might adversely affect the conduct of our current business including by restricting our ability to finance future operations and capital needs and limiting our ability to engage in other business activities these covenants will place restrictions on our ability and the ability of our operating subsidiaries to among other things 

• incur additional debt • create liens or other encumbrances • pay dividends or make other restricted payments including payments by resorts and mtr to eri and to each other • agree to payment restrictions affecting our restricted subsidiaries • prepay subordinated indebtedness • make investments loans or other guarantees • sell or otherwise dispose of a portion of our assets or • make acquisitions or merge or consolidate with another entity our credit facilities also include certain financial and other covenants including maintaining certain total leverage and earnings to fixed charge ratios as well as restrictions on capital expenditures our ability to comply with these provisions may be affected by general economic conditions industry conditions and other events beyond our control we cannot assure you that we will be able to comply with these covenants if we fail to comply with a financial covenant or other restriction contained in the agreements governing our indebtedness an event of default could occur an event of default could result in acceleration of some or all of the applicable indebtedness and the inability to borrow additional funds we do not have and are not certain we would be able to obtain sufficient funds to repay any such indebtedness if it is accelerated 

eri is a holding company and will depend on its subsidiaries for dividends distributions and other payments 

eri is structured as a holding company a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries eris only significant asset is the capital stock or other equity interests of its operating subsidiaries as a holding company eri conducts all of its business through its subsidiaries consequently eris principal source of cash flow including cash flow to pay dividends will be dividends and distributions from its subsidiaries if eris subsidiaries are unable to make dividend payments or distributions to it and sufficient cash or liquidity is not otherwise available eri may not be able to pay dividends the current indebtedness of resorts and mtr gaming restricts and any future indebtedness of theirs will likely restrict the ability of resorts and mtr gaming to make dividends or distributions to eri in addition eris right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiarys liquidation or reorganization will be subject to the prior claims of the subsidiarys creditors 

servicing debt and funding other obligations requires a significant amount of cash and our ability to generate sufficient cash depends on many factors some of which are beyond our control 

our ability to make payments on and refinance our indebtedness and to fund our operations and capital expenditures depends upon our ability to generate cash flow and secure financing in the future our ability to generate future cash flow depends among other things upon 

• our future operating performance • the demand for services resorts mtr and silver legacy provide • general economic conditions • competition and • legislative and regulatory factors affecting our operations and business some of these factors are beyond our control we cannot assure you that our businesses will generate cash flow from operations or that future debt or equity financings will be available to us to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our needs as a result we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity we cannot assure that we will be able to refinance any indebtedness on favorable terms or at all any inability to generate sufficient cash flow or refinance our indebtedness on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 

if we are unable to finance our expansion development investment and renovation projects as well as other capital expenditures through cash flow borrowings under our existing credit facilities and additional financings our expansion development investment and renovation efforts will be jeopardized 

we intend to finance our current and future development investment renovation and expansion projects as well as our other capital expenditures primarily with cash flow from operations and equity or debt financings if we are unable to finance our current or future expansion development investment and renovation projects or our other capital expenditures we will have to adopt one or more alternatives such as reducing delaying or abandoning planned development investment renovation and expansion projects as well as other capital expenditures selling assets restructuring debt obtaining additional equity financing or joint venture partners these sources of funds may not be sufficient to finance our development investment renovation and expansion projects and other financing may not be available on acceptable terms in a timely manner or at all in addition the agreements governing our existing indebtedness contains certain restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness 

recently there were significant disruptions in the global capital markets that adversely impacted the ability of borrowers to access capital although the financial markets have seen recent signs of recovery and increased availability of capital the financial markets remain volatile 

to the extent that cash flow from operations are not sufficient to fund our development investment renovation and expansion projects we would be required to seek additional financing which may not be available to us or if available may not be on terms favorable to us 

the operating agreement of silver legacy joint venture contains a buysell provision which if exercised by either partner could adversely affect us 

the operating agreement for the entity that owns the silver legacy contains a buysell provision pursuant to which either resorts or the wholly owned subsidiary of mgm resorts international that owns its 50 interest in the silver legacy joint venture may sell its membership interest or purchase the interest of the other member in either case at the price proposed by the offering member if 

either member should make such an offer the operating agreement requires the other member to either sell its membership interest or purchase the membership interest of the offering member in either case at the price proposed by the offering member an election by either member to exercise its buysell right which would result in the buyout of one of the members could adversely impact its operations depending among other things on its ability to respond to an offer from the other member and the price at which any offer is made mgm resorts international has significantly greater resources than we have if an offer by either member results in the purchase of its interest in the silver legacy joint venture the sale of the interest could adversely affect or result in the termination of any existing arrangements or agreements resorts may have with silver legacy or the other member or otherwise adversely impact us 

the market price of eris common stock could fluctuate significantly 

the us securities markets in general have experienced significant price fluctuations in recent years the market price of eris common stock may be volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in addition the trading volume of eris common stock may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur some of the factors that could cause fluctuations in or have a material adverse effect on the stock price or trading volume of eris common stock include 

• general market and economic conditions including market conditions in the hotel and casino industries • actual or expected variations in operating results • differences between actual operating results and those expected by investors and analysts • changes in recommendations by securities analysts • operations and stock performance of competitors • accounting charges including charges relating to the impairment of goodwill • significant acquisitions or strategic alliances by eri or by competitors • sales of eris common stock or other securities in the future including sales by our directors and officers or significant investors • recruitment or departure of key personnel • conditions and trends in the gaming and entertainment industries • changes in the estimate of the future size and growth of our markets and • changes in reserves for professional liability claims we cannot assure you that the stock price of eri common stock will not fluctuate or decline significantly in the future in addition the stock market in general can experience considerable price and volume fluctuations that may be unrelated to eris performance if the market price of eri common stock fluctuates significantly eri may become the subject of securities class action litigation which may result in substantial costs and a diversion of managements attention and resources 

eri has not yet determined its dividend policy and may not pay dividends 

eri has not yet determined its dividend policy but it does not currently expect to pay dividends on its common stock any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of the eri board of directors and will depend upon among other factors eris earnings cash requirements financial condition requirements to comply with the covenants under its debt instruments including limitations on the ability of mtr and eldorado to make distributions to eri legal considerations and 

other factors that the eri board of directors deems relevant if eri does not pay dividends then the return on an investment in its common stock will depend entirely upon any future appreciation in its stock price there is no guarantee that eris common stock will appreciate in value or maintain its value 

the volatility and disruption of the capital and credit markets and adverse changes in the us and global economies may negatively impact our access to financing 

during recent years a confluence of many factors has contributed to diminished expectations for the us economy and increased market volatility for publicly traded securities including the common shares and notes issued by publicly owned companies these factors include the availability and cost of credit declining business and consumer confidence and increased unemployment these conditions have combined to create an unprecedented level of market volatility which could negatively impact our ability to access capital and financing including financing necessary to refinance our existing indebtedness on terms and at prices acceptable to us that we would otherwise need in connection with the operation of our businesses 

risk factors relating to our operations 

our business is sensitive to reductions in discretionary consumer spending as a result of downturns in the economy 

consumer demand for casino hotel and racetrack properties such as ours is particularly sensitive to downturns in the economy and the associated impact on discretionary spending on leisure activities changes in discretionary consumer spending or consumer preferences brought about by factors such as perceived or actual general economic conditions effects of declines in consumer confidence in the economy including the recent housing employment and credit crisis the impact of high energy and food costs the increased cost of travel the potential for continued bank failures decreased disposable consumer income and wealth or fears of war and future acts of terrorism could further reduce customer demand for the amenities that we offer which have had and may continue to have a negative impact on our results of operations increases in gasoline prices including increases prompted by global political and economic instabilities can adversely affect the operations of resorts and mtr because most of their patrons travel to their properties by car or on airlines that may pass on increases in fuel costs to passengers in the form of higher ticket prices the recent global national and regional economic downturn including the housing crisis credit crisis lower consumer confidence and other related factors which impact discretionary consumer spending and other economic activities that have direct effects on resorts and mtr gamings business have resulted in a decline in the tourism industry that has adversely impacted their operations we cannot be sure how long these factors will continue to impact our operations in the future or the extent of the impact 

we face substantial competition in the hotel and casino industry and expect that such competition will continue 

the gaming industry is characterized by an increasingly high degree of competition among a large number of participants including landbased casinos dockside casinos riverboat casinos casinos located on native american reservations and other forms of legalized gaming there is intense competition among companies in the gaming industry many of which have significantly greater resources than we do certain states have legalized casino gaming and other states may legalize gaming in the future legalized casino gaming in these states and on native american reservations near our markets or changes to gaming laws in states surrounding nevada louisiana west virginia pennsylvania or ohio could increase competition and could adversely affect our operations we also compete to a lesser extent with gaming facilities in other jurisdictions with dockside gaming facilities state sponsored lotteries onandoff track parimutuel wagering card clubs riverboat casinos and other 

forms of legalized gambling in addition various forms of internet gaming have been approved in nevada and new jersey and legislation permitting internet gaming has been proposed by the federal government and other states the expansion of internet gaming in nevada and other jurisdictions could result in significant additional competition 

gaming competition is intense in most of the markets where we operate recently there has been additional significant competition in our markets as a result of the expansion of facilities by existing market participants the entrance of new gaming participants into a market or legislative changes for example casino gaming is currently prohibited in several jurisdictions from which the shreveportbossier city market draws customers primarily texas the texas legislature has from time to time considered proposals to legalize gaming and there can be no assurance that casino gaming will not be approved in texas in the future which would have a material adverse effect on our business additionally since visitors from california comprise a significant portion of our customer base in reno we also compete with native american gaming operations in california native american tribes are allowed to operate slot machines lottery games and banking and percentage games on native american lands although many existing native american gaming facilities in northern california are modest compared to eldorado reno and silver legacy a number of native american tribes have established largescale gaming facilities in california and some native american tribes have announced that they are in the process of expanding developing or are considering establishing largescale hotel and gaming facilities in northern california a new 320000 square foot gaming facility located in sonoma county california opened on november 5 2013 additionally a new 30000 square foot casino and 400room hotel in bossier city across the red river from eldorado shreveport opened in june 2013 which includes several restaurants and a 1000seat entertainment arena in december 2014 a new luxury landbased casino with 1600 slot machines 72 gaming tables a poker room and a 740room hotel with a ballroom and spa opened in lake charles louisiana approximately 200 miles south of eldorado shreveport but closer to the houston texas market with respect to our mtr gaming facilities an additional license has been granted for a casino to be located in lawrence county pennsylvania approximately 45 miles from mountaineer and 90 miles from presque isle downs which would result in further competition for both of those properties further gaming facilities in ohio that have recently commenced operations including the horseshoe casino cleveland hollywood casino columbus thistledown racino northfield park and beulah park present significant competition for mountaineer presque isle downs and scioto downs 

increased competition may require us to make substantial capital expenditures to maintain and enhance the competitive positions of our properties to increase the attractiveness and add to the appeal of our facilities because we are highly leveraged after satisfying our obligations under our outstanding indebtedness there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient funds to undertake these expenditures or that we will be able to obtain sufficient financing to fund such expenditures if we are unable to make such expenditures our competitive position could be materially adversely affected 

we may face integration difficulties and may be unable to integrate mtr gamings business into eris business successfully or realize the anticipated benefits of the merger 

the merger involved the combination of two companies that previously operated as independent companies mtr gaming is now a whollyowned subsidiary of eri we have devoted and will continue to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating the companies business practices and operations potential difficulties we may encounter as part of the integration process include the following 

• the inability to successfully combine our two businesses in a manner that permits us to achieve the full revenue and other benefits anticipated to result from the merger 23 

• complexities associated with managing the combined businesses including difficulty addressing possible differences in corporate cultures and management philosophies and the challenge of integrating complex systems technology networks and other assets of each of the companies in a seamless manner that minimizes any adverse impact on customers suppliers employees and other constituencies and • potential unknown liabilities and unforeseen increased expenses associated with the merger in addition it is possible that the integration process could result in 

• the diversion of the attention of management and • the disruption of or the loss of momentum in each companys ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards controls procedures and policies any of which could adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with customers suppliers employees and other constituencies or our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger or could reduce our earnings or otherwise adversely affect our business and financial results 

our future results could suffer if we cannot effectively manage our expanded operations following the merger 

following the merger the size of the combined businesses is significantly larger than the previous size of either resorts or mtr gamings business our future success depends in part upon our ability to manage this expanded business which will pose substantial challenges for management including challenges related to the management and monitoring of new operations and associated increased costs and complexity there can be no assurances that we will be successful or that we will realize any operating efficiencies cost savings revenue enhancements or other benefits currently anticipated from the merger 

we may incur additional expenses related to the merger and the integration of our businesses 

we have already incurred and may in the future incur expenses in connection with the merger and the integration of our businesses there are a large number of processes policies procedures operations technologies and systems that must be integrated including purchasing accounting and finance sales payroll pricing marketing and benefits while we have made significant progress in integrating resorts and mtr we may identify additional steps that should be taken to fully integrate the operation of our businesses any additional steps we take could affect the total amount or the timing of the integration expenses and any such expenses are difficult to estimate accurately 

we will be subject to extensive state and local regulation and licensing and gaming authorities have significant control over our operations which could have an adverse effect on our business 

the ownership and operation of casino gaming riverboat and horseracing facilities are subject to extensive federal state and local regulation and regulatory authorities at the federal state and local levels have broad powers with respect to the licensing of gaming businesses and may revoke suspend condition or limit our gaming or other licenses impose substantial fines and take other actions each of which poses a significant risk to our business financial condition and results of operations we currently hold all state and local licenses and related approvals necessary to conduct our present gaming operations but we must periodically apply to renew many of our licenses and registrations we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such renewals any failure to maintain or renew our existing licenses registrations permits or approvals would have a material adverse effect on us furthermore if additional laws or regulations are adopted or existing laws or regulations are amended these regulations could impose additional restrictions or costs that could have a significant adverse effect on us as an example on august 26 2014 the board of health of hancock county west virginia adopted and approved the clean air regulation act of 2014 regulation which will be 

effective july 1 2015 the regulation as currently adopted will ban smoking in public places in hancock county including at mountaineer we are continuing to evaluate the regulation its impact on our mountaineer facility and steps to become compliant with the regulation upon its effective date we expect that the regulation will have a negative impact on our business and results of operations at mountaineer and such impact may be material 

any of the nevada gaming commission the louisiana gaming control board the west virginia alcohol beverage control administration the west virginia lottery commission the west virginia racing commission the pennsylvania gaming control board the pennsylvania racing commission the pennsylvania liquor control board the ohio lottery commission and the ohio state racing commission which we refer to collectively as the gaming authorities may in their discretion require the holder of any securities issued by us to file applications be investigated and be found suitable to own our securities if it has reason to believe that the security ownership would be inconsistent with the declared policies of their respective jurisdictions further the costs of any investigation conducted by any of the gaming authorities under these circumstances must be paid by the applicant and refusal or failure to pay these charges may constitute grounds for a finding that the applicant is unsuitable to own the securities if any of the gaming authorities determines that a person is unsuitable to own our securities then under the applicable gaming or horse racing laws and regulations we can be sanctioned including the loss of their approvals if without the prior approval of the applicable gaming authority we conduct certain business with the unsuitable person 

our officers directors and key employees will also be subject to a variety of regulatory requirements and various licensing and related approval procedures in the various jurisdictions in which we operate gaming facilities if any of the applicable gaming authorities were to find an officer director or key employee of ours unsuitable for licensing or unsuitable to continue having a relationship with us we would have to sever all relationships with that person furthermore the gaming authorities may require us to terminate the employment of any person who refuses to file appropriate applications either result could materially adversely affect our gaming operations 

applicable gaming laws and regulations restrict our ability to issue securities incur debt and undertake other financing activities such transactions would generally require approval of applicable gaming authorities and our financing counterparties including lenders might be subject to various licensing and related approval procedures in the various jurisdictions in which we operate gaming facilities if state regulatory authorities were to find any person unsuitable with regard to his her or its relationship to us or any of our subsidiaries we would be required to sever our relationships with that person which could materially adversely affect our business 

in addition gaming companies are generally subject to significant revenue based taxes and fees in addition to normal federal state and local income taxes and such taxes and fees are subject to increase at any time we pay substantial taxes and fees with respect to our operations from time to time federal state and local legislators and officials have proposed changes in tax laws or in the administration of such laws affecting the gaming industry in addition worsening economic conditions could intensify the efforts of state and local governments to raise revenues through increases in gaming taxes andor property taxes it is not possible to determine with certainty the likelihood of changes in tax laws or in the administration of such laws such changes if adopted could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations the large number of state and local governments with significant current or projected budget deficits makes it more likely that those governments that currently permit gaming will seek to fund such deficits with new or increased gaming taxes andor property taxes and worsening economic conditions could intensify those efforts any material increase or the adoption of additional taxes or fees could have a material adverse effect on our future financial results 

for more information see governmental gaming regulations in item 1 

we rely on our key personnel 

our future success will depend upon among other things our ability to keep our senior executives and highly qualified employees we compete with other potential employers for employees and we may not succeed in hiring or retaining the executives and other employees that we need we might not enter into employment contracts with all of our senior executives and we might not obtain key man insurance policies for any or all of our executives a sudden loss of or inability to replace key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operation 

we may face difficulties in attracting and retaining qualified employees for our casinos and race tracks 

the operation of our business requires qualified executives managers and skilled employees with gaming and horse racing industry experience and qualifications who are able to obtain the requisite licenses and approval from the applicable gaming authorities while not currently the case there has from time to time been a shortage of skilled labor in the regions of resorts and mtr gamings casinos and race tracks in addition to limitations that may otherwise exist in the supply of skilled labor the continued expansion of gaming near resorts and mtr gamings casinos and race tracks including the expansion of native american gaming may make it more difficult for us to attract qualified individuals while we believe that we will continue to be able to attract and retain qualified employees shortages of skilled labor will make it increasingly difficult and expensive to attract and retain the services of a satisfactory number of qualified employees and we may incur higher costs than expected as a result 

we depend on agreements with our horsemen and parimutuel clerks to operate our business 

the federal interstate horse racing act and the state racing laws in west virginia ohio and pennsylvania require that in order to simulcast races we have written agreements with the horse owners and trainers at those racetracks in addition in order to operate slot machines in west virginia we are required to enter into written agreements regarding the proceeds of the slot machines a proceeds agreement with a representative of a majority of the horse owners and trainers and with a representative of a majority of the parimutuel clerks 

if we fail to maintain operative agreements with the horsemen at any of our racetracks we will not be permitted to conduct live racing and export and import simulcasting at the applicable racetrack in addition if we fail to maintain operative agreements with the horsemen at mountaineer presque isle downs and scioto downs including if we do not have in place the legally required proceeds agreement with the mountaineer parimutuel clerks union we will not be permitted to continue our gaming operations at those facilities if we fail to renew or modify existing agreements on satisfactory terms this failure could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

work stoppages organizing drives and other labor problems could negatively impact our future profits 

some of our employees are currently represented by labor unions a lengthy strike or other work stoppages at any of our casino properties could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations given the large number of employees labor unions are making a concerted effort to recruit more employees in the gaming industry in addition organized labor may benefit from new legislation or legal interpretations by the current presidential administration particularly in light of current support for changes to federal and state labor laws we cannot provide any assurance that we will not experience additional and more successful union organization activity in the future 

because portions of the land on which our facilities are situated are leased the termination of such leases could adversely affect our business 

resorts owns the parcel on which eldorado reno is located except for approximately 30000 square feet which is leased from c s  y associates a general partnership of which donald carano father of gary l carano is a general partner the csy lease the csy lease expires on june 30 2027 if resorts defaults on a payment under the csy lease or if certain other specified events were to occur c s  y associates has the right to terminate the lease and take possession of the property located on the premises if c s  y associates were to exercise these rights this could adversely affect our business 

a subsidiary of resorts is party to a ground lease with the city of shreveport for the land on which eldorado shreveport was built the shreveport lease the shreveport lease has a term ending december 20 2015 with subsequent renewals for up to an additional 35 years if resorts defaults on a payment under the shreveport lease or if certain other specified events were to occur the city of shreveport could terminate the lease if the city of shreveport were to exercise this right this could adversely affect our business 

because we own real property we will be subject to extensive environmental regulation which creates uncertainty regarding future environmental expenditures and liabilities 

we are subject to various federal state and local environmental health and safety laws and regulations that govern activities that may have adverse environmental effects such as discharges to air and water as well as the use storage discharge emission and disposal of solid animal and hazardous wastes and exposure to hazardous materials these laws and regulations are complex and frequently subject to change in addition our horseracing facilities are subject to laws and regulations that address the impacts of manure and wastewater generated by concentrated animal feeding operations cafo on water quality including but not limited to storm water discharges cafo regulations include permit requirements and water quality discharge standards enforcement of cafo regulations has been receiving increased governmental attention compliance with these and other environmental laws can in some circumstances require significant capital expenditures we have from time to time been responsible for investigating and remediating or contributing to remediation costs related to contamination located at or near certain of our facilities including contamination related to underground storage tanks and groundwater contamination arising from prior uses of land on which certain of our facilities are located in addition we have been and may in the future be required to manage abate remove or contain manure and wastewater generated by concentrated animal feeding operations due to our racetrack operations mold lead asbestoscontaining materials or other hazardous conditions found in or on our properties moreover violations can result in significant fines or penalties and in some instances interruption or cessation of operations 

we are also subject to laws and regulations that create liability and cleanup responsibility for releases of regulated materials into the environment certain of these laws and regulations impose strict and under certain circumstances joint and several liability on a current or previous owner or operator of property for the costs of remediating regulated materials on or emanating from its property the costs of investigation remediation or removal of those substances may be substantial 

an earthquake flood act of terrorism other natural disasters could adversely affect our business 

although we maintain insurance that is customary and appropriate for our business each of our insurance policies is subject to certain exclusions in addition in some cases our property insurance coverage is combined among certain of our properties and silver legacy or is otherwise in an amount that may be significantly less than the expected replacement cost of rebuilding our facilities in the event of a total loss such losses may occur as a result of any number of casualty events including as a result 

of earthquakes floods hurricanes or other severe weather conditions in particular the reno area has been and may in the future be subject to earthquakes and other natural disasters and eldorado shreveport is located in a designated flood zone inadequate insurance or lack of available insurance for these and other certain types or levels of risk could expose us to significant losses in the event that a catastrophe occurred for which we are underinsured in addition to the damage caused to our properties by a casualty loss we may suffer business disruption as a result of the casualty event or be subject to claims by third parties that may be injured or harmed while we carry general liability insurance and business interruption insurance there can be no assurance that insurance will be available or adequate to cover all loss and damage to which our business or our assets might be subjected in addition certain casualty events such as labor strikes nuclear events loss of income due to terrorism deterioration or corrosion insect or animal damage and pollution may not be covered under our policies any losses we incur that are not adequately covered by insurance may decrease our future operating income require us to fund replacements or repairs for destroyed property and reduce the funds available for payments of our obligations 

eldorado reno and the silver legacy currently have combined insurance coverage for earthquake and flood damage and for any resulting business interruption and eldorado reno silver legacy and eldorado shreveport have combined insurance coverage for acts of terrorism under these policies eldorado reno and the silver legacy have combined per occurrence earthquake coverage of 100 million and combined aggregate flood coverage of 250 million eldorado reno silver legacy and eldorado shreveport have combined terrorism coverage of 800 million in the event that an earthquake flood or terrorist act causes damage only to eldorado renos property eldorado reno is eligible to receive up to the full amount of insurance coverage for the applicable event of loss depending on the replacement cost however in the event that eldorado reno and silver legacy are damaged in an earthquake eldorado reno is only entitled to receive insurance proceeds only after silver legacys claims have been satisfied in addition in the event that both eldorado reno and silver legacy are damaged in a flood or eldorado reno eldorado shreveport and silver legacy are damaged as a result of a terrorist act our properties are entitled to receive an allocated portion of the insurance proceeds and to the extent that any insurance proceeds remain available after satisfaction of the insurance claims by the other properties such remaining proceeds as a result there is no assurance that our insurance coverage will be sufficient if there is a major event of loss that impacts us and silver legacy and in particular if there is an earthquake that causes significant damage in addition upon the expiration of our current policies which expire in august 2015 subject to annual renewal we cannot assure that adequate coverage will be available at economically justifiable rates if at all 

because eldorado shreveport is located in a designated flood zone it is subject to risks in addition to those risks associated with landbased casinos including loss of service due to flood hurricane or other severe weather conditions we currently maintain flood insurance for eldorado shreveport and for the potential resulting business interruption however there is no assurance that this coverage will be sufficient if there is a major flood reduced patronage the loss of use of the casino the inability to use a dockside facility or riverboat for any period of time due to flood hurricane or other severe weather could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are subject to risks relating to mechanical failure 

all of our facilities will generally be subject to the risk that operations could be halted for a temporary or extended period of time as the result of casualty forces of nature mechanical failure or extended or extraordinary maintenance among other causes in addition our gaming operations could be damaged or halted due to extreme weather conditions these risks are particularly pronounced at eldorado shreveports riverboat and dockside facilities because of their location on and adjacent to water 

we are or may become involved in legal proceedings that if adversely adjudicated or settled could impact our business and financial condition 

from time to time we are named in lawsuits or other legal proceedings relating to our respective businesses in particular the nature of our business subjects us to the risk of lawsuits filed by customers past and present employees competitors business partners and others in the ordinary course of business as with all legal proceedings no assurances can be given as to the outcome of these matters moreover legal proceedings can be expensive and time consuming and we may not be successful in defending or prosecuting these lawsuits which could result in settlements or damages that could significantly impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

our information technology and other systems are subject to cyber security risk including misappropriation of customer information or other breaches of information security 

our operations require that we collect customer data including credit card numbers and other personally identifiable information for various business purposes including marketing and promotional purposes the collection and use of personal data are governed by privacy laws and regulations enacted in the united states and other jurisdictions around the world privacy regulations continue to evolve and on occasion may be inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another compliance with applicable privacy regulations may increase our operating costs andor adversely impact our ability to market our products properties and services to our customers in addition noncompliance with applicable privacy regulations by us or in some circumstances noncompliance by third parties engaged by us or a breach of security on systems storing our data including due to cyberattack system failure computer virus or unauthorized or fraudulent use by customers employees or employees of third party vendors may result in damage of reputation andor subject us to fines payment of damages lawsuits or restrictions on our use or transfer of data 

operations of resorts and mtr gaming have historically been subject to seasonal variations and quarterly fluctuations in operating results and we can expect to experience such variations and fluctuation in the future 

historically the operations of resorts and mtr gamings gaming facilities have typically been subject to seasonal variations 

eldorado renos strongest operating results have generally occurred in the second and third quarters and the weakest results have generally occurred during the period from november through february when weather conditions adversely affected operating results in the reno market excessive snowfall during the winter months can make travel to the reno area more difficult this often results in significant declines in traffic on major highways particularly on routes to and from northern california and causes a decline in customer volume furthermore management believes that approximately twothirds of visitors to the reno market arrive by some form of ground transportation 

in addition winter conditions can frequently adversely affect transportation routes to mountaineer presque isle downs and scioto downs and cause cancellations of live horse racing as a result unfavorable seasonal conditions could have a material adverse effect on our operations 

in general it is unlikely that we will be able to obtain business interruption coverage for casualties resulting from severe weather and there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain casualty insurance coverage at affordable rates if at all for casualties resulting from severe weather 

because we will be heavily dependent upon hotelcasino and related operations that are conducted in certain limited regions we will be subject to greater risks than a company that is geographically or otherwise more diversified 

our business is heavily dependent upon hotelcasino and related operations that are conducted in three discrete markets as a result we are still subject to a greater degree of risk than a gaming company that has greater geographical diversity the risks to which we have a greater degree of exposure include the following 

• local economic and competitive conditions • inaccessibility due to weather conditions road construction or closure of primary access routes • changes in local and state governmental laws and regulations including gaming laws and regulations • natural and other disasters including earthquakes and flooding • a decline in the number of residents in or near or visitors to our operations and • a decrease in gaming activities at any of our facilities any of the factors outlined above could adversely affect our ability to generate sufficient cash flow to make payments on our outstanding indebtedness 

significant negative industry or economic trends reduced estimates of future cash flows disruptions to our business slower growth rates or lack of growth in our business may cause us to incur impairments to indefinite lived intangible assets or longlived assets 

we test indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually or if a triggering event occurs we will also be required to consider whether the fair values of any of our investments accounted for under the equity method have declined below their carrying value whenever adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate that recorded values may not be recoverable estimated fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis based on estimated future results of the investee and market indicators of the terminal year capitalization rate if any such declines are considered to be other than temporary we will be required to record a writedown to estimated fair value in 2011 resorts impairment test in the silver legacy joint venture resulted in the recognition of a noncash impairment charge of 331 million resulting in the elimination of resorts remaining investment in the silver legacy joint venture at that time 

security concerns terrorist attacks and other geopolitical events could have a material adverse effect on our future operations 

security concerns terrorist attacks and other geopolitical events can have a material adverse effect on leisure and business travel discretionary spending and other areas of economic behavior that directly impact the gaming and entertainment industries in general and our business in particular we cannot predict the extent to which any future security alerts terrorist attacks or other geopolitical events might impact our business results of operations or financial condition

 item 3 legal proceedings 

we are a party to various lawsuits which have arisen in the normal course of our business estimated losses are accrued for these lawsuits and claims when the loss is probable and can be estimated the current liability for the estimated losses associated with those lawsuits is not material to our consolidated financial condition and those estimated losses are not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations

significant factors impacting operating trends 

key performance metrics 

our operating results are highly dependent on the volume of customers visiting and staying at our properties key performance metrics include volume indicators such as table games drop and slot handle which refer to amounts wagered by our customers the amount of volume we retain which is not fully controllable by us is recognized as casino revenues and is referred to as our win or hold in addition hotel occupancy and price per room designated by average daily rate adr are key indicators for our hotel business our calculation of adr consists of the average price of occupied rooms per day including the impact of complimentary rooms complimentary room rates are determined based on an analysis of retail or cash rates for each customer segment and each type of room product to estimate complimentary rates which are consistent with retail rates complimentary rates are reviewed at least annually and on an interim basis if there are significant changes in market conditions complimentary rooms are treated as occupied rooms in our calculation of hotel occupancy 

economic impact 

the economic downturn and the uneven recovery from the downturn continue to adversely influence consumers confidence discretionary spending levels and travel patterns high unemployment and the record number of home foreclosures experienced in the economic downturn increased competition and volatility of the economy have had and continue to have a significant negative impact on the gaming and tourism industries and as a result our operating performance over the past several years in response to the impact of the economic down turn increased competition and other market factors on our business our management has implemented cost savings measures and will continue to review our operations to look for opportunities to further reduce expenses and maximize cash flows while there has been some improvement in the economy we believe the impact of the economic downturn and the continuing uneven recovery may continue to negatively affect our operating results for some period of time we remain uncertain as to the duration and magnitude of the impact of such factors on our operations and the length and sustainability of the recovery from the economic downturn 

expansion of native american gaming and regional gaming 

our business has been adversely impacted by the expansion of native american gaming and the expansion of gaming in our markets including ohio future growth of native american and other gaming establishments including the addition of hotel rooms and other amenities would place additional competitive pressure on our operations while we cannot predict the extent of any future impact it could be significant 

eldorado reno a significant portion of our revenues and operating income are generated from patrons who are residents of northern california and northeastern texas and as such our operations have been adversely impacted by the growth in native american gaming in northern california and to a lesser extent in oklahoma 

many existing native american gaming facilities in northern california are modest compared to eldorado reno however a number of native american tribes have established largescale gaming facilities in california and some native american tribes have announced that they are in the process of expanding developing or are considering establishing largescale hotel and gaming facilities in northern california as northern california native american gaming operations have expanded we believe the increasing competition generated by these gaming operations has had a negative impact principally on drivein daytrip visitor traffic from our main feeder markets in northern california 

under their current compacts most native american tribes in california may operate up to 2000 slot machines and up to two gaming facilities on any one reservation however under action taken by the national indian gaming commission gaming devices similar in appearance to slot machines but which are deemed to be technological enhancements to bingo style gaming are not subject to such limits and may be used by tribes without state permission the number of slot machines the tribes may be allowed to operate could increase as a result of any new or amended compacts the tribes may enter into with the state of california that receive the requisite approvals such increases have occurred with respect to a number of new or amended compacts which have been executed and approved 

eldorado shreveport casino gaming is currently prohibited in several jurisdictions from which the shreveportbossier city market draws customers primarily texas although casino gaming is currently not permitted in texas the texas legislature has from time to time considered proposals to authorize casino gaming and there can be no assurance that casino gaming will not be approved in texas in the future which would have a material adverse effect on our business eldorado shreveport competes with several native american casinos located in oklahoma certain of which are located near our core texas markets because we draw a significant amount of our customers from the dallasfort worth area but are located approximately 190 miles from that area we believe we will continue to face increased competition from gaming operations in oklahoma including the winstar and choctaw casinos and would face significant competition that may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations if casino gaming is approved in texas in june 2013 construction was completed on a new 30000 square foot casino and 400room hotel in bossier city across the red river from eldorado shreveport the facility which also includes several restaurants and a 1000seat entertainment arena received final approval from the louisiana gaming control board and opened on june 15 2013 in december 2014 a new luxury landbased casino with 1600 slot machines 72 gaming tables a poker room and a 740room hotel with a ballroom and spa opened in lake charles louisiana approximately 200 miles south of eldorado shreveport but closer to the houston texas market in addition a new 320000 square foot gaming facility located in sonoma county california opened on november 5 2013

liquidity and capital resources 

the primary sources of liquidity and capital resources have been existing cash cash flow from operations and proceeds from the issuance of debt securities 

we expect that our primary capital requirements going forward will relate to the operation and maintenance of our properties and servicing our outstanding indebtedness in 2015 we plan to spend approximately 292 million net of reimbursements from west virginia on qualified capital expenditures and approximately 790 million to pay interest on the resorts senior secured notes and mtr second lien notes we expect that cash generated from operations will be sufficient to fund our operations and capital requirements and service our outstanding indebtedness for the foreseeable future however we cannot provide assurance that operating cash flows will be sufficient to do so and we cannot be sure that we will be able to refinance our outstanding debt prior to its maturity in 2019 on terms that we find acceptable or at all 

at december 31 2014 we had consolidated cash and cash equivalents of 876 million 607 million of which was held by mtr gaming and 270 million of which was held by resorts 

eri is a holding company and its only significant assets are ownership interests in its subsidiaries mtr gaming and holdco eris ability to fund its obligations depends on the cash flow of its subsidiaries and the ability of its subsidiaries to distribute or otherwise make funds available to eri the agreements governing the indebtedness of mtr gaming limit mtr gamings ability to distribute or otherwise make funds available to eri or holdco and its subsidiaries including resorts and the agreements governing indebtedness of resorts limit resorts ability to distribute or otherwise make funds available to eri or mtr gaming and its subsidiaries the ability of mtr gaming and resorts to make funds available to eri and each other will also depend on among other things their earnings business and tax considerations and applicable law including regulations of gaming and racing authorities and state laws regulating the payment of dividends and distributions such limitations could adversely impact the liquidity of eri mtr gaming holdco and their respective subsidiaries 

operating cash flow for the year ended december 31 2014 we generated cash flows from operating activities of 339 million as compared to 236 million in the prior year the increase in operating cash was primarily due to various changes in balance sheet accounts in conjunction with the merger along with changes in the balance sheet accounts in the normal course of business these changes were offset by the decline in net income including the absence of silver legacys gain on the early retirement of its debt for the year ended december 31 2014 compared to the prior year

the repayment of our longterm debt which consists of indebtedness evidenced by the resorts senior secured notes and the mtr second lien notes is subject to acceleration upon the occurrence of an event of default under the indentures governing these obligations 

we routinely enter into operational contracts in the ordinary course of our business including construction contracts for minor projects that are not material to our business or financial condition as a whole our commitments relating to these contracts are recognized as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets when services are provided with respect to such contracts 

the company does not currently have any offbalance sheet arrangements 

inflation 

we do not believe that inflation has had a significant impact on our revenues results of operations or cash flows since inception 

other liquidity matters 

the pennsylvania gaming control board the pgcb the pennsylvania department of revenue and the pennsylvania state police collectively the borrowers were required to fund the costs they incurred in connection with the initial development of the infrastructure to support gaming operations in pennsylvania as well as the initial ongoing costs of the borrowers the initial funding of these costs was provided from a loan from the pennsylvania general fund in the amount of approximately 361 million and further funding was provided from additional loans from the pennsylvania property tax reserve fund in the aggregate amount of approximately 638 million 

the pennsylvania department of revenue will assess all licensees including presque isle downs their proportionate share of amounts represented by the borrowings which are in the aggregate amount of 999 million once the designated number of pennsylvanias slot machine licensees is operational on july 11 2011 the pgcb issued an administrative order which established that payments associated with the 638 million that was borrowed from the property tax reserve fund would commence on january 1 2012 the repayment allocation between all current licensees is based upon equal weighting of i cumulative gross slot revenue since inception in relation to the combined cumulative gross slot revenue for all licensees and ii single year gross slot revenue during the states fiscal year ending june 30 in relation to the combined single year gross slot revenue for all licensees and amounts paid each year will be adjusted annually based upon changes in the licensees proportionate share of gross slot revenue we have estimated that our total proportionate share of the aggregate 638 million to be assessed to the gaming facilities will be approximately 42 million and will be paid quarterly over a tenyear period which began effective january 1 2012 for the 361 million that was borrowed from the general fund payment is scheduled to begin after all fourteen licensees are operational although we cannot determine when payment will begin we have considered a similar repayment model for the general fund borrowings and estimated that our total proportionate share of the aggregate 361 million to all fourteen gaming facilities will be approximately 22 million 

the recorded estimate is subject to revision based upon future changes in the revenue assumptions utilized to develop the estimate our estimated total obligation at december 31 2014 is 50 million the company paid approximately 04 million during the year ended december 31 2014 

we are faced with certain contingencies involving litigation and environmental remediation and compliance these commitments and contingencies are discussed in greater detail in part i item 3 legal proceedings and note 15 to our consolidated financial statements both of which are included elsewhere in this report in addition new competition may have a material adverse effect on our revenues and could have a similar adverse effect on our liquidity see part i item 1a risk factors—risks related to our business which is included elsewhere in this report 

critical accounting policies 

our significant accounting policies are included in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements which is included elsewhere in this report these policies along with the underlying assumptions and judgments made by our management in their application have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty and actual results could differ from our estimates 

business combinations 

the company applied the provisions of accounting standards codification asc topic 805 business combinations in the accounting for the merger it required us to recognize the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair values goodwill as of the acquisition date was measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed while we used our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date our estimates were inherently uncertain and subject to refinement as a result during the measurement period which may be up to one year from the acquisition date we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill upon the final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed any subsequent adjustments will be recorded in our consolidated statements of operations 

accounting for business combinations required our management to make significant estimates and assumptions including our estimate of intangible assets such as gaming licenses trade names and customer loyalty programs although we believe the assumptions and estimates made have been reasonable and appropriate they are inherently uncertain for our gaming license valuation our properties estimated future cash flows were the primary assumption in the respective intangible valuations cash flow estimates included assumptions regarding factors such as recent and budgeted operating performance net win per unit revenue patron visits and growth percentages the growth percentages were developed considering general macroeconomic conditions as well as competitive impacts from current and anticipated competition through a review of customer market data operating margins and current regulatory social and economic climates the most significant of the assumptions used in the valuations included 1 revenue growthdecline percentages 2 discount rates 3 effective income tax rates 4 future terminal values and 5 capital expenditure assumptions these assumptions were developed for each of our properties based on historical trends in the current competitive markets in which they operate and projections of future performance and competition the primary assumptions with respect to our trade names and customer loyalty program intangibles primary assumptions were selecting the appropriate royalty rates and cost estimates for replacement cost analyses 

in addition uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed in connection with a business combination are initially estimated as of the acquisition date the company will reevaluate these items quarterly based upon facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date with any adjustments to our preliminary estimates being recorded to goodwill if identified within the measurement period subsequent to the measurement period or our final determination of the tax allowances or contingencys estimated value whichever comes first changes to these uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances will affect our provision for income taxes in our consolidated statement of operations and could have material impact on our results of operations and financial position 

accounting for unconsolidated affiliates 

the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company and its subsidiaries investments in unconsolidated affiliates which are 50 or less owned and do not meet the consolidation criteria of asc 810 consolidation are accounted for under the equity method all intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation certain amendments of asc 810 became effective for us beginning january 1 2010 such amendments include changes to the quantitative approach to determine the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity vie an enterprise must determine if its variable interest or interests give it a controlling financial interest in a vie by evaluating whether 1 the enterprise has the power to direct activities of the vie that have a significant effect on economic performance and 2 the enterprise has an obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the vie the amendments to asc 810 also require ongoing reassessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a vie the company believes the adoption of these amendments did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 

the company considers whether the fair values of any of its equity method investments have declined below their carrying value whenever adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate that recorded values may not be recoverable if the company considers any such decline to be other than temporary then a writedown would be recorded to the estimated fair value estimated fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis based on estimated future results of the investee and market indicators of terminal year capitalization rate there were no impairments of the companys equity method investments in 2014 2013 or 2012 

revenue recognition 

gaming revenues consist of the net win from gaming activities which is the difference between amounts wagered and amounts paid to winning patrons and is recognized at the time wagers are made net of winning payouts to patrons base and progressive jackpots are accrued and charged to revenue at the time the obligation to pay the jackpot is established parimutuel commissions consist of commissions earned from thoroughbred and harness racing and importing of simulcast signals from other race tracks parimutuel commissions are recognized at the time wagers are made such commissions are a designated portion of the wagering handle as determined by state racing commissions and are shown net of the taxes assessed by state and local agencies as well as purses and other contractual amounts paid to horsemen associations we recognize revenues from fees earned through the exporting of simulcast signals to other race tracks at the time wagers are made such fees are based upon a predetermined percentage of handle as contracted with the other race tracks revenues from food and beverage are recognized at the time of sale and revenues from lodging are recognized on the date of stay other revenues are recorded at the time services are rendered or merchandise sold we offer certain promotional allowances to our customers including complimentary lodging food and beverage and promotional credits for free play on slot machines the retail value of these promotional items is shown as a reduction in total revenues on our consolidated statements of operations 

income taxes 

the company and its subsidiaries file us federal income tax returns and various state and local income tax returns the company does not have tax sharing agreements with the other members within the consolidated eri group with few exceptions the company is no longer subject to us federal or state and local tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2011 

the company estimates an annual effective income tax rate based on projected results for the year and applies this rate to income before taxes to calculate income tax expense any refinements made due to subsequent information that affects the estimated annual effective income tax rate are reflected as adjustments in the current period the income tax provision results in an effective tax rate that has an unusual relationship to the companys pretax income loss this is due to the federal and state valuation allowances on the companys deferred tax assets as discussed below 

the difference between the effective rate and the statutory rate is attributed primarily to the federal and state valuation allowances on the companys deferred tax assets as discussed below as a result of the companys net operating losses and net deferred tax asset position after exclusion of certain deferred tax liabilities that generally cannot be offset against deferred tax assets known as naked credits the company expects to continue to provide for a full valuation allowance against substantially all of the net federal and the net state deferred tax assets 

for income tax purposes the company amortizes or depreciates certain assets that have been assigned an indefinite life for book purposes the incremental amortization or depreciation deductions for income tax purposes result in an increase in certain deferred tax liabilities that cannot be used as a source of future taxable income for purposes of measuring the companys need for a valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets therefore the company expects to record noncash deferred tax expense as the company amortizes these assets for tax purposes 

prior to the merger date holdco was taxed as a partnership under the internal revenue code pursuant to which income taxes were primarily the responsibility of the partners eri is a c corporation subject to the federal and state corporatelevel income taxes at prevailing corporate tax rates while taxed as a partnership holdco was not subject to federal income tax liability because holders of membership interests in holdco were required to include their respective shares of holdcos taxable income including that of resorts in their individual income tax returns distributions 

were made to their respective members to cover such tax liabilities such distributions were subject to limitation in accordance with the provisions of their respective operating agreements eldorado shreveport 2 llc has elected as a single member limited liability company to be taxed as a c corporation current and deferred income taxes associated with eldorado shreveport 2 llc were not material 

under the applicable accounting standards we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is morelikelythannot that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement the accounting standards also provide guidance on derecognition classification interest and penalties on income taxes accounting in interim periods and disclosure requirements for uncertain tax positions we have recorded no liability associated with uncertain tax positions at december 31 2014 and 2013 

property and equipment and other longlived assets 

property and equipment is recorded at cost except for mtr which was adjusted for fair value under asc 805 and is depreciated over its estimated useful life or lease term judgments are made in determining estimated useful lives and salvage values of these assets the accuracy of these estimates affects the amount of depreciation expense recognized in our financial results and whether we have a gain or loss on the disposal of assets we review depreciation estimates and methods as new events occur more experience is acquired and additional information is obtained that would possibly change our current estimates 

property equipment and other longlived assets are assessed for impairment in accordance with asc 360— property  plant  and equipment  the company evaluates its longlived assets periodically for impairment issues or more frequently whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable recoverability of these assets is determined by comparing the net carrying value to the sum of the estimated future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by these assets the amount of impairment loss if any is measured by the difference between the net carrying value and the estimated fair value of the asset which is typically measured using a discounted cash flow model level 3 of the fair value hierarchy for assets to be disposed of impairment is recognized based on the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs of disposal as estimated based on comparable asset sales offers received or a discounted cash flow model based on the results of our periodic reviews we have not recorded any impairment losses during the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 

for undeveloped properties including nonoperating real properties when indicators of impairment are present properties are evaluated for impairment and losses are recorded when undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by an asset or market comparisons are less than the assets carrying amount the amount of the impairment loss is calculated as the excess of the assets carrying value over its fair value which is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis management estimates or market comparisons the fair value measurements employed for our impairment evaluations which are subject to the assumptions and factors as previously discussed were generally based on a review of comparable activities in the marketplace which falls within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy 

goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets 

goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price paid over the fair value of the net assets of the acquired business intangible assets acquired in business combinations are recorded based upon their fair value at the date of acquisition goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets are 

reviewed for impairment annually during the fourth quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired 

goodwill is tested by comparing the carrying value of the reporting unit to its fair value the company estimates the fair value of the reporting unit utilizing income and market approaches the income approach is based on projected future cash flow that is discounted to present value using factors that consider the timing and risk of the future cash flows the market approach is based on the companys market capitalization at the testing date the aggregate carrying value of the companys goodwill approximated 668 million as of december 31 2014 the company did not have goodwill prior to the merger date 

other indefinitelived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying value any excess of carrying value over the fair value is recognized as an impairment within the consolidated statement of operations in the period of review our indefinitelived intangible assets consist of racing and gaming licenses trade names and customer loyalty programs 

the gaming and racing licenses of each property were valued in aggregate for each respective property as these licenses are considered to be the most significant asset of the properties and the gaming licenses could not be obtained without holding the racing licenses therefore market participant would consider the licenses in aggregate the fair value of the licenses is calculated using an excess earnings methodology which is an income approach methodology that allocates the projected cash flows of the property to the gaming license intangible assets less charges for the use of the other identifiable assets of the property including working capital fixed assets and other intangible assets we believe this methodology is appropriate as the gaming licenses are the primary asset to the properties the licenses are linked to each respective facility and its the lowest level at which discrete cash flows can be directly attributable to the assets under the gaming legislation applicable to our properties licenses are property specific and can only be acquired if a buyer acquires the existing facility because existing licenses may not be acquired and transferred for use at a different facility the estimated future cash flows of each of our properties was the primary assumption in the valuation of such property the aggregate carrying value of the companys gaming license intangibles approximated 4820 million as of december 31 2014 

assessing the indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment is a process that requires significant judgment and involves detailed quantitative and qualitative businessspecific analysis and many individual assumptions which fluctuate between assessments our properties estimated future cash flows are a primary assumption in the respective impairment analyses unforeseen events changes in circumstances and market conditions and material differences in estimates of future cash flows could negatively affect the fair value of our assets and result in an impairment charge which could be material cash flow estimates include assumptions regarding factors such as recent and budgeted operating performance net win per unit revenue patron visits growth percentages which are developed considering general macroeconomic conditions as well as competitive impacts from current and anticipated competition through a review of customer market data operating margins and current regulatory social and economic climates these estimates could also be negatively impacted by changes in federal state or local regulations economic downturns or developments and other market conditions affecting travel and access to the properties the most significant of the assumptions used in our valuations include 1 revenue growthdecline percentages 2 discount rates 3 effective income tax rates 4 future terminal values and 5 capital expenditure assumptions these assumptions were developed for each property based on historical trends the current competitive markets in which they operate and projections of future performance and competition 

the company values trade names using the relieffromroyalty method royalty rates range from 05  10 the customer loyalty program was valued using a combination of a replacement cost and 

lost profits analysis trade names are amortized on a straightline basis over a 35 year useful life and the customer loyalty program is being amortized on a straightline basis over a one year useful life the aggregate carrying value of trade names and customer loyalty program intangibles as of december 31 2014 was approximately 67 million and 48 million respectively 

we believe we have used reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the fair value of our other indefinitelived intangible assets however these estimates and assumptions could be materially different from actual results if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected or if events occur or circumstances change that would reduce the fair value of our licensing intangibles below the carrying value reflected on the consolidated balance sheet we may be required to conduct an interim test or possibly recognize impairment charges which may be material in future periods 

no impairment charges were recorded for our other indefinitelived intangible assets in any of the years presented 

reserve for uncollectible accounts receivable 

we reserve an estimated amount for receivables that may not be collected methodologies for estimating bad debt reserves range from specific reserves to various percentages applied to aged receivables historical collection rates are considered as are customer relationships in determining specific reserves as with many estimates management must make judgments about potential actions by third parties in establishing and evaluating our reserves for bad debts 

selfinsurance reserves 

eldorado reno and eldorado shreveport are selfinsured for their group health programs and eldorado reno is selfinsured for its workmens compensation program we utilize historical claims information provided by our third party administrators to make estimates for known pending claims as well as claims that have been incurred but not reported as of the balance sheet date in order to mitigate our potential exposure we have an individual claim stop loss policy on our group health claims and a specific claim stop loss policy on our workmens compensation claims if we become aware of significant claims or material changes affecting our estimates we would increase our reserves in the period in which we made such a determination and record the additional expense at december 31 2014 and 2013 13 million was accrued for insurance and workmens compensation medical claims reserves and is included in accrued and other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets 

frequent players program 

we offer programs whereby our participating patrons can accumulate points for wagering that can be redeemed for credits for free play on slot machines lodging food and beverage merchandise and in limited situations cash based upon the estimated redemptions of frequent player program points an estimated liability is established for the cost of redemption on earned but unredeemed points the estimated cost of redemption utilizes estimates and assumptions of the mix of the various product offerings for which the points will be redeemed and costs of such product offerings changes in the programs membership levels and redemption patterns of our participating patrons can impact this liability the aggregate outstanding liability for the frequent players program was 24 million and 20 million at december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively and is included as a component of other accrued liabilities in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets 

litigation claims and assessments 

we utilize estimates for litigation claims and assessments these estimates are based on our knowledge and experience regarding current and past events as well as assumptions about future events if our assessment of such a matter should change we may have to change the estimates which 

may have an adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows actual results could differ from these estimates
