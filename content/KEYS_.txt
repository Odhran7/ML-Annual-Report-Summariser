intellectual property 

we generate patent and other intellectual property rights covering significant inventions and other innovations in order to create a competitive advantage although we believe that our licenses patents and other intellectual property rights have value in general no single license patent or other intellectual property right is in itself material other than the keysight mark 

materials 

our manufacturing operations employ a wide variety of semiconductors electromechanical components and assemblies and raw materials such as plastic resins and sheet metal we purchase materials from thousands of suppliers on a global basis some of the parts that require custom design work are not readily available from alternate suppliers due to their unique design or the length of time necessary for design work our longterm relationships with suppliers allow us to proactively manage technology road maps and product discontinuance plans and monitor their financial health to address the potential disruption in and other risks related to our supply chain we use a number of techniques including qualifying multiple sources of supply and redesign of solutions for alternative components in addition while we generally attempt to keep our inventory at optimal levels we do purchase incremental inventory as circumstances warrant to protect the supply chain with the global shortages and increased leadtimes for materials such as semiconductors and passive components we align our purchase leadtimes

 item 1a risk factors 

risks uncertainties and other factors that may affect future results 

risks related to our business 

volatile geopolitical turmoil including popular uprisings regional conflicts terrorism and war could result in market instability which could negatively impact our business results 

we are a global company with international operations and we sell our products and solutions in countries throughout the world recent escalation in regional conflicts including the russian invasion of ukraine which resulted in economic sanctions and the risk of increased tensions between china and taiwan could limit or prohibit our ability to transfer certain technologies to sell our products and solutions and could result in closure of facilities in sanctioned countries such as our recent decision to discontinue operations in russia in addition international conflict has resulted in increased pressure on the supply chain and could further result in increased energy costs which could increase the cost of manufacturing selling and delivering products and solutions inflation which could result in increases in the cost of manufacturing products and solutions reduced customer purchasing power increased price pressure and reduced or cancelled orders increased risk of cybersecurity attacks and market instability which could adversely impact our financial results 

uncertainty in general economic conditions may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

our business is sensitive to negative changes in general economic conditions both inside and outside the united states global and regional economic uncertainty inflation recession or depression may impact our business resulting in 

• increased cost to manufacture products or deliver solutions 

• reduced customer purchasing power 

• reduced demand for our solutions delays in the shipment of orders or increases in order cancellations 

• increased risk of excess and obsolete inventory 

• increased price pressure for our solutions and services and 

• greater risk of impairment to the value and a detriment to the liquidity of our future investment portfolio 

in addition global and regional macroeconomic developments such as increased unemployment decreased income uncertainty related to future economic activity reduced access to credit increased interest rates volatility in capital markets decreased liquidity uncertain or destabilizing national election results in the us europe and asia and negative changes or volatility in general economic conditions in the us europe and asia could negatively affect our ability to conduct business in those territories financial difficulties experienced by our suppliers and customers including distributors due to economic volatility or negative changes could result in product delays reduced purchasing power delays in payment or inability to pay us and inventory issues economic risks related to accounts receivable could result in delays in collection and greater bad debt expense 

economic political and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our results of operations 

because we operate our businesses and sell our solutions worldwide our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally we anticipate that revenue from international operations will continue to represent a majority of our total revenue however there can be no assurances that our international sales will continue at existing levels or grow in accordance with our effort to increase foreign market penetration in addition many of our employees contract manufacturers suppliers and manufacturing facilities are located outside the united states accordingly our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors including but not limited to 

• inability to conduct business in certain countries or regions or with certain customers due to us sanctions or trade restrictions 

• inability to sell certain products technologies or services to countries regions facilities or customers due to us sanctions or trade restrictions 

• changes in a specific countrys or regions political economic or other conditions including but not limited to changes that favor national interests and economic volatility 

  

• negative impact of a country’s response to or an imposed reduction in economic activity and other economic and political measures taken to contain the spread of global pandemic conditions 

• negative consequences from changes in tax laws 

• difficulty in protecting intellectual property 

• injunctions or exclusion orders related to intellectual property disputes 

• interruptions to transportation flows for delivery of parts to us and finished goods to our customers 

• changes in foreign currency exchange rates 

• difficulty in staffing and managing foreign operations 

• local competition 

• differing labor regulations 

• unexpected changes in regulatory requirements 

• inadequate local infrastructure 

• potential incidences of corruption and fraudulent business practices and 

• volatile geopolitical turmoil including popular uprisings regional conflicts terrorism and war 

we centralize most of our accounting processes at two locations india and malaysia if conditions change in those countries it may adversely affect operations including impairing our ability to pay our suppliers our results of operations as well as our liquidity may be adversely affected and possible delays may occur in reporting financial results 

further even if we are able to successfully manage the risks of international operations our business may be adversely affected if our business partners are not able to successfully manage similar risks 

economic and political policies favoring national interests could adversely affect our results of operations 

nationalistic economic policies and political trends such as opposition to globalization and free trade sanctions or trade restrictions including those on advanced computing and semiconductor manufacturing withdrawal from or renegotiation of global trade agreements tax policies that favor domestic industries and interests the distancing or potential exit of countries from the european union and other similar actions may result in increased transaction costs reduced ability to hire employees reduced access to supplies and materials reduced demand or access to customers and inability to conduct our operations as they have been conducted historically each of these factors may adversely affect our business 

international trade disputes and increased tariffs between the united states and the united kingdom the european union singapore malaysia and china among other countries could substantially change our expectations and ability to operate in such jurisdictions as we have done historically many of our suppliers vendors customers partners and other entities with whom we do business have strong ties to doing business in china their ability to supply materials to us buy products or services from us or otherwise work with us is affected by their ability to do business in china if the us’s relationship with china results in additional trade disputes trade protection measures retaliatory actions tariffs and increased barriers policies that favor domestic industries or increased import or export licensing requirements or restrictions then our deployment of resources in jurisdictions affected by such measures could be misaligned and our operations may be adversely affected due to such changes in the economic and political ecosystem in which our suppliers vendors customers partners and other entities with whom we do business operate 

global health crises such as the covid19 pandemic have had an impact on our supply chain and could have a material impact on our global operations our customers and our vendors which could adversely impact our business results and financial condition 

the continued evolution of covid19 and its variants as well as periodic spikes in infection rates local outbreaks on our sites or supplier customer or vendor sites in spite of safety measures or vaccinations could cause disruptions to our operations or those of our suppliers customers or vendors the pandemic has led to global supply chain challenges which have adversely 

  

impacted our ability to procure certain components and could impact our ability to manufacture products and cause delays in delivery of our solutions to our customers as new variants of the virus appear especially variants that are more easily spread cause more serious outcomes or are resistant to existing vaccines new health orders and safety protocols could further impact our onsite operations and our ability to manufacture ship or deliver products and solutions to customers 

these factors could materially and negatively impact our business results operations revenue growth and overall financial condition 

our operating results and financial condition could be harmed if the markets into which we sell our solutions decline or do not grow as anticipated 

visibility into our markets is limited our quarterly sales and operating results are highly dependent on the volume and timing of technologyrelated spending and orders received during the fiscal quarter which are difficult to forecast and may be cancelled by our customers in addition our revenues and earnings forecasts for future fiscal quarters are often based on the expected seasonality or cyclicality of our markets however due to the uncertainties and volatile economic environment created by increased geopolitical tensions including the war between russia and ukraine the impact of inflation the potential for future recession and continued supply chain challenges the markets we serve may experience increased volatility and may not experience the seasonality or cyclicality that we expect any decline in our customers markets would likely result in a reduction in demand for our solutions and services if our customers markets decline we may not be able to collect on outstanding amounts due to us such declines could harm our financial position results of operations cash flows and stock price and could limit our profitability in such an environment pricing pressures could intensify since a significant portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed in nature due to sales rd and manufacturing costs if we were unable to respond quickly enough these pricing pressures could further reduce our operating margins 

a decreased demand for our customers’ products or trade restrictions could adversely affect our results of operations 

our business depends on our customers’ ability to manufacture design and sell their products in the marketplace international trade disputes affecting our customers could adversely affect our business tariffs on imports to or from china could increase the cost of our customers’ components and raw materials which could make our customers’ products and services more expensive and could reduce demand for our customers’ products protectionist and retaliatory trade measures by either china or the united states could limit our customers’ ability to sell their products and services and could reduce demand for our customers’ products our customers and other entities in our customer chain could decide to take actions in response to international trade disputes that we could not foresee a decrease in demand or significant change in operations from our customers due to international trade disputes could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

in addition to the above our customers and suppliers have become subject to us export restrictions and sanctions such as being added to the us department of commerce’s “lists of parties of concern” and having us export privileges denied or suspended when a customer or supplier of ours becomes subject to such sanctions we suspend our business with such customer or supplier because of the continued tense political and economic relationship between the us and china and between the us and russia new restrictions or sanctions have been imposed with little notice which could leave us without an adequate alternative solution to compensate for our inability to continue to do business with such customer or supplier some of our suppliers and customers in the supply chain are working on unique solutions and products in the market and it may be difficult if not impossible to replace them especially with short notice we cannot predict what impact future sanctions could have on our customers or suppliers and therefore our business any export restrictions or sanctions and any tariffs or other trade restriction imposed on our customers or suppliers could adversely affect our financial condition and business 

failure to introduce successful new solutions and services in a timely manner to address increased competition rapid technological changes and changing industry standards could result in our solutions and services becoming obsolete 

we generally sell our solutions in industries that are characterized by increased competition through frequent new solution and service introductions rapid technological changes and changing industry standards in addition many of the markets in which we operate are seasonal and cyclical without the timely introduction of new solutions services and enhancements our solutions and services will become technologically obsolete over time in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer our ability to offer new solutions and services and to deploy them in a timely manner depend on several factors including but not limited to our ability to 

• properly identify and assess customer needs 

• innovate and develop new technologies services and applications 

• successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner 

  

• manufacture and deliver our solutions in sufficient volumes and on time 

• differentiate our offerings from our competitors offerings 

• price our solutions competitively 

• anticipate our competitors development of new solutions services or technological innovations and 

• control product quality in our manufacturing process 

our future operating results may fluctuate significantly if our investments in innovative technologies are not as profitable as we anticipate 

on a regular basis we review the existing technologies available in the market and identify strategic new technologies to develop and invest in we are currently devoting significant resources to new technologies in the communications automotive battery internet of things and mobile industries we are investing in rd developing relationships with customers and suppliers and redirecting our corporate and operational resources to grow within these innovative technologies our income could be harmed if we fail to expand our customer base if demand for our solutions is lower than we expect or if our income related to the innovative technologies is lower than we anticipate we provide solutions for the design development and manufacturing stages of our customers’ workflow our customers who currently use our solutions in one stage of their workflow may not use our solutions in other aspects of their manufacturing process 

failure to adjust our purchases due to changing market conditions or failure to estimate our customers demand could adversely affect our income 

our income could be harmed if we are unable to adjust our purchases to market fluctuations including those caused by global economic conditions volatile geopolitical conflict or the seasonal or cyclical nature of the markets in which we operate the sale of our solutions and services are dependent to a large degree on customers whose industries are subject to seasonal or cyclical trends in the demand for their products for example the consumer electronics market is particularly volatile making demand difficult to anticipate making such estimations in an economic climate affected by inflation or recession fluctuations in global currency geopolitical tension and war is particularly difficult as increased volatility may impact seasonal trends making it more difficult to anticipate demand fluctuations additionally the current disruption to the global supply chain has impacted our ability to purchase parts and components to meet increasing product demand which has increased lead times delayed shipments and could materially affect our results we have seen a shortage of parts for some of our products in addition some of the parts that require custom design are not readily available from alternate suppliers due to their unique design or the length of time necessary for design work should a supplier cease manufacturing such a component we would be forced to reengineer our solution in addition to discontinuing parts suppliers may also extend lead times limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors in order to secure components for the production of products we may continue to enter into noncancellable purchase commitments with vendors or at times make advance payments to suppliers which could impact our ability to adjust our inventory to declining market demands prior commitments of this type have resulted in an excess of parts when demand for electronic products has decreased if demand for our solutions is less than we expect we may experience additional excess and obsolete inventories and be forced to incur additional charges 

dependence on contract manufacturing and outsourcing other portions of our supply chain may adversely affect our ability to bring solutions to market and damage our reputation dependence on outsourced information technology and other administrative functions may impair our ability to operate effectively 

as part of our efforts to streamline operations and to cut costs we outsource aspects of our manufacturing processes and other functions and continue to evaluate additional outsourcing if our contract manufacturers or other outsourcers fail to perform their obligations in a timely manner or at satisfactory quality levels our ability to bring solutions to market and our reputation could suffer for example during a market upturn our contract manufacturers may be unable to meet our demand requirements which may preclude us from fulfilling our customers orders on a timely basis the ability of these manufacturers to perform is largely outside of our control additionally changing or replacing our contract manufacturers or other outsourced vendors could cause disruptions or delays in addition we outsource significant portions of our information technology it and other administrative functions since it is critical to our operations any failure of our it providers to perform could impair our ability to operate effectively in addition to the risks outlined above problems with manufacturing or it outsourcing could result in lower revenues and unrealized efficiencies and could impact our results of operations and stock price much of our outsourcing takes place in developing countries and as a result may be subject to geopolitical uncertainty 

  

our operating results may suffer if our manufacturing capacity does not match the demand for our solutions 

because we cannot immediately adapt our production capacity and related cost structures to rapidly changing market conditions when demand is lower than our expectations our manufacturing capacity will likely exceed our production requirements during a general market upturn or an upturn in our business if we cannot increase our manufacturing capacity to meet product demand we will not be able to fulfill orders in a timely manner which could lead to order cancellations contract breaches or indemnification obligations this inability could materially and adversely limit our ability to improve our income margin and operating results by contrast if during an economic downturn we had excess manufacturing capacity then our fixed costs associated with excess manufacturing capacity would adversely affect our income margins and operating results 

key customers or large orders may expose us to additional business and legal risks that could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition  

as a global company we have key customers all over the world although no one customer makes up more than 10 percent of our revenue sales to those customers could be reduced or eliminated as a result of failure to respond to customer needs reduced customer demand increased sales to our competitors inability to manufacture or ship products and solutions supply chain constraints trade restrictions sanctions and embargoes we have experienced forced reductions in sales and been prevented from selling large orders to certain key customers due to trade restrictions which we have been able to mitigate with the addition of new customers and new business if we have future reductions in sales or lose key customers there is no guarantee that we will be able to mitigate the impact of such reductions or losses which could negatively impact our income operating results and financial condition 

certain key customers have substantial purchasing power and leverage in negotiating contractual arrangements with us these customers may demand contract terms that differ considerably from our standard terms and conditions large orders may also include severe contractual liabilities if we fail to provide the quantity and quality of product at the required delivery times or fail to meet other obligations while we attempt to contractually limit our potential liability we may agree to some or all of these provisions to secure these orders and grow our business such actions expose us to significant additional risks which could result in a material adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition 

industry consolidation and consolidation among our customer base may lead to increased competition and may harm our operating results 

there is potential for industry consolidation in our markets as companies attempt to strengthen or hold their market positions in an evolving industry companies could be acquired or may be unable to continue operations companies that are strategic alliance partners in some areas of our business may acquire or form alliances with our competitors thereby reducing their business with us we believe that industry consolidation may result in stronger competitors and could lead to more variability in our operating results and could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition furthermore particularly in the communications market rapid consolidation would lead to fewer customers with the effect that loss of a major customer could have a material impact on results not anticipated in a customer marketplace composed of more numerous participants 

additionally if there is consolidation among our customer base our customers may be able to command increased leverage in negotiating prices and other terms of sale which could adversely affect our profitability in addition if as a result of increased leverage customer pressures require us to reduce our pricing such that our gross margins are diminished we could decide not to sell our solutions under such less favorable terms which would decrease our revenue consolidation among our customer base may also lead to reduced demand for our solutions replacement of our products by the combined entity with those of our competitors and cancellations of orders each of which could harm our operating results 

our acquisitions strategic alliances joint ventures internal reorganizations and divestitures may result in financial results that are different than expected 

in the normal course of business we may engage in discussions with third parties relating to possible acquisitions strategic alliances joint ventures and divestitures additionally we occasionally make changes to our internal structure to align business products services and solutions with market demands and to obtain cost synergies and operational efficiencies as a result of such transactions our financial results may differ from our own or the investment communitys expectations in a given fiscal quarter or over the long term if market conditions or other factors lead us to change our strategic direction we may not realize the expected value from such transactions or reorganizations further such thirdparty transactions often have postclosing arrangements including but not limited to postclosing adjustments transition services escrows or indemnifications the financial results of which can be difficult to predict in addition acquisitions and strategic alliances may require us to integrate a different company culture management team employees and business infrastructure into our existing operations without impacting the business operations of the newly acquired company we may have difficulty developing manufacturing and 

  

marketing the products of a newly acquired company in a way that enhances performance and expands the markets of the newly acquired company the acquired company may not enhance the performance of our businesses or product lines such that we do not realize the value from expected synergies depending on the size and complexity of an acquisition the successful integration of the entity depends on a variety of factors including but not limited to 

• the achievement of anticipated cost savings synergies business opportunities and growth prospects from combining the acquired company 

• the scalability of production manufacturing and marketing of products of a newly acquired company to broader adjacent markets 

• the ability to cohesively integrate operations product definitions price lists contract terms and conditions delivery and technical support for products and solutions of a newly acquired company into our existing operations 

• the compatibility of our infrastructure operations policies and organizations with those of the acquired company 

• the retention of key employees andor customers 

• the management of facilities and employees in different geographic areas and 

• the management of relationships with our strategic partners suppliers and customer base 

if we do not realize the expected benefits or synergies of such transactions our consolidated financial position results of operations cash flows and stock price could be negatively impacted additionally we may record significant goodwill and other assets as a result of acquisitions or investments and we may be required to incur impairment charges which could adversely affect our consolidated financial position and results of operations 

any inability to complete acquisitions on acceptable terms could negatively impact our growth rate and financial performance 

our ability to grow revenues earnings and cash flow depends in part upon our ability to identify and successfully acquire and integrate businesses at appropriate prices and realize anticipated synergies and business performance appropriate targets for acquisition are difficult to identify and complete for a variety of reasons including but not limited to limited due diligence high valuations business and intellectual property evaluations other interested parties negotiations of the definitive documentation satisfaction of closing conditions the need to obtain antitrust or other regulatory approvals on acceptable terms and availability of funding the inability to close appropriate acquisitions on acceptable terms could adversely impact our growth rate revenue and financial performance 

we may need additional financing in the future to meet our capital needs or to make opportunistic acquisitions and such financing may not be available on terms favorable to us if at all and may be dilutive to existing shareholders 

we may need to seek additional financing for our general corporate purposes for example we may need to increase our investment in rd activities or need funds to make acquisitions we may be unable to obtain any desired additional financing on terms favorable to us if at all if adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms we may be unable to fund our expansion successfully develop or enhance solutions or respond to competitive pressures any of which could negatively affect our business if we finance acquisitions by issuing additional convertible debt or equity securities our existing stockholders may experience share dilution which could affect the market price of our stock if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity securities our shareholders will experience dilution of their ownership interest if we raise additional funds by issuing debt we may be subject to further limitations on our operations and ability to pay dividends due to restrictive covenants 

we have outstanding debt and may incur other debt in the future which could adversely affect our financial condition liquidity and results of operations 

we currently have outstanding debt as well as availability to borrow under a revolving credit facility we may borrow additional amounts in the future and use the proceeds from any future borrowing for general corporate purposes future acquisitions expansion of our business or repurchases of our outstanding shares of common stock 

our incurrence of this debt and increases in our aggregate levels of debt may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition by among other things 

• requiring a portion of our cash flow from operations to make interest payments on this debt 

  

• increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions 

• reducing the cash flow available to fund capital expenditures and other corporate purposes and to grow our business and 

• limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the industry 

our current revolving credit facility and term loan imposes restrictions on us including restrictions on our ability to create liens on our assets and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur indebtedness and requires us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios our ability to comply with these ratios may be affected by events beyond our control in addition the indenture governing our senior notes contains covenants that may adversely affect our ability to incur certain liens if we breach any of the covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders then subject to applicable cure periods our outstanding indebtedness could be declared immediately due and payable 

if currency exchange rates fluctuate substantially in the future our financial results could be adversely affected 

a substantial amount of our solutions are priced and paid for in us dollars although many of our solutions are priced in local currencies and a significant amount of certain types of expenses such as payroll utilities tax and marketing expenses are paid in local currencies our hedging programs are designed to reduce but not entirely eliminate within any given 12month period the impact of currency exchange rate movements including those caused by currency controls which could impact our business operating results and financial condition by resulting in lower revenue or increased expenses however for expenses beyond a 12month period our hedging strategy will not mitigate our exchange rate risk in addition our currency hedging programs involve thirdparty financial institutions as counterparties the weakening or failure of these counterparties may adversely affect our hedging programs and our financial condition through among other things a reduction in the number of available counterparties increasingly unfavorable terms or the failure of counterparties to perform under hedging contracts 

volatile changes in weather conditions and effects of climate change could damage or destroy strategic facilities including our headquarters which could have a significant negative impact on our operations 

we and our customers and suppliers are vulnerable to the increasing impact of climate change volatile changes in weather conditions including extreme heat or cold could increase the risk of wildfires floods blizzards hurricanes and other weatherrelated disasters such extreme weather events can cause power outages and network disruptions that may result in disruption to operations and may impact our ability to manufacture and ship product which may negatively impact revenue disasters created by extreme conditions could cause significant damage to or destruction of our facilities resulting in temporary or longterm closures of our facilities and operations and significant expense for repair or replacement of damaged or destroyed facilities this could also result in loss or damage to employee homes employees relocating to other parts of the country or being unwilling to relocate to the strategic locations housing shortages and loss of or inability to recruit key employees this could result in adverse impact to the available workforce damage to or destruction of inventory inability to manufacture and deliver solutions cancellation of orders and breaches of customer contracts leading to reduced revenue 

if we suffer a loss to our employees factories facilities or distribution system due to a catastrophic event our operations could be significantly harmed 

our factories facilities and distribution system are vulnerable to catastrophic loss due to natural or manmade disasters several of our facilities could be subject to a catastrophic loss caused by earthquake or other natural disasters due to their locations for example our production facilities headquarters and laboratories in california and our production facilities in japan are all located in areas with aboveaverage seismic activity if any of these facilities were to experience a catastrophic loss it could disrupt our operations delay production shipments and revenue and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility in addition since we have consolidated our manufacturing facilities we are more likely to experience an interruption to our operations in the event of a catastrophe in any one location although we carry insurance for property damage and business interruption we do not carry insurance or financial reserves for interruptions or potential losses arising from earthquakes or terrorism also our thirdparty insurance coverage will vary from time to time in both type and amount depending on availability cost and our decisions with respect to risk retention economic conditions and uncertainties in global markets may adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain thirdparty insurance if our thirdparty insurance coverage is adversely affected or to the extent we have elected to selfinsure we may be at a greater risk that our operations will be harmed by a catastrophic loss 

  

our commitment to net zero emissions in company operations by fiscal year 2040 will be subject to significant costs and regulations which could impact business operations processes revenue and reputation 

in may 2021 the company disclosed its commitment to achieving net zero scope 1 and scope 2 emissions by the end of fiscal year 2040 the company plans to meet this commitment by reducing energy consumption through efficiency and conservation measures investments in renewable energy and selective purchase of certified offsets for residual emissions the company also committed in september 2021 to developing approved sciencebased targets in line with limiting global warming to 15 degrees celsius above preindustrial levels in addition to scope 1 and scope 2 emissions defined by our net zero goal the company will develop scope 3 reduction and engagement targets across relevant categories as part of our commitment to sciencebased targets the development and implementation of goals and targets may require significant and expensive capital improvements changes in product development manufacturing processes and shipping methods these changes may materially increase the cost to manufacture and ship products and solutions result in price increases to customers reduce product or solution performance and create customer dissatisfaction potentially adversely impacting our revenue and profitability 

achieving net zero emissions goals and targets may entail compliance with evolving laws and regulatory requirements which may cause us to change or reconfigure facilities and operations to meet regulatory standards if operations are out of compliance we may be subject to civil or criminal actions fines and penalties and be required to make significant changes to facilities and operations and temporarily or permanently shut down noncompliant operations which could result in business disruption and significant unexpected expense delays in or inability to develop manufacture and ship products and solutions customer dissatisfaction loss of revenue and damage to our reputation 

if we are unable to sufficiently reduce scope 1 and scope 2 emissions through energy reduction measures or our investments in renewable energy are not successful we may fail to achieve our net zero emission commitment by fiscal year 2040 if we are unable to achieve scope 3 reduction and engagement targets we may fail to achieve our commitment to sciencebased targets failing to achieve the company’s net zero or sciencebased targets commitments could result in regulatory noncompliance criminal or civil actions against us assessment of fees and penalties inability to develop manufacture and ship products customer dissatisfaction with our products and solutions reduced revenue and profitability shareholder lawsuits and damage to our reputation 

third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property rights and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling solutions or services 

from time to time parties have claimed that one or more of our solutions or services infringe their intellectual property rights we analyze and take action in response to such claims on a casebycase basis on january 1 2022 centripetal networks filed a lawsuit in federal district court in virginia alleging that certain keysight products infringe certain of centripetal’s patents in addition in february 2022 centripetal filed complaints in germany alleging infringement of certain of centripetal’s german patents and in april 2022 centripetal filed a complaint with the international trade commission “itc” requesting that they investigate whether keysight should be enjoined from importing certain products that are manufactured outside of the us which are alleged to infringe centripetal patents although we deny the allegations and intend to aggressively defend each case the outcome of existing proceedings lawsuits and claims may differ from our expectations because the outcomes of litigation are often difficult to reliably predict 

disputes and litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property are costly and timeconsuming due to the complexity of our technology and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation and could divert our management and key personnel from business operations claims of intellectual property infringement could cause us to enter into a costly or restrictive license agreement which may not be available under acceptable terms or at all require us to redesign certain of our solutions which would be costly and timeconsuming andor subject us to significant damages or an injunction against the development sale and importation of certain solutions or services in certain of our businesses we rely on thirdparty intellectual property licenses and we cannot ensure that these licenses will be available to us in the future on terms favorable to us or at all 

third parties may infringe our intellectual property rights and we may suffer competitive injury or expend significant resources enforcing our intellectual property rights 

our success depends in part on our proprietary technology including technology we obtained through acquisitions we rely on various intellectual property rights including patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets as well as confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish our proprietary rights if we do not enforce our intellectual property rights successfully our competitive position may suffer which could harm our operating results 

our pending patent copyright and trademark registration applications may not be allowed or competitors may challenge the validity or scope of our patents copyrights or trademarks in addition our patents copyrights trademarks and other intellectual property rights may not provide us with a significant competitive advantage in preparation for the separation and 

  

distribution we applied for trademarks related to new global brand name in various jurisdictions worldwide any successful opposition to our applications in material jurisdictions could impose material costs on us or make it more difficult to protect our brand different jurisdictions vary widely in the level of protection and priority they give to trademark and other intellectual property rights 

we may be required to spend significant resources monitoring our intellectual property rights and we may or may not be able to detect infringement of such rights by third parties our competitive position may be harmed if we cannot detect infringement and enforce our intellectual property rights in a timely manner or at all in some circumstances we may choose to not pursue enforcement due to a variety of reasons in addition competitors may avoid infringement by designing around our intellectual property rights or by developing noninfringing competing technologies intellectual property rights and our ability to enforce them may be unavailable or limited in some countries which could make it easier for competitors to infringe our intellectual property rights capture market share and could result in lost revenues to the company furthermore some of our intellectual property is licensed to others which allows them to compete with us using that intellectual property 

if we experience a significant cybersecurity attack or disruption in our it systems our business reputation and operating results could be adversely affected 

we rely on several centralized it systems to provide solutions and services maintain financial records retain sensitive data such as intellectual property proprietary business information and data related to customers suppliers and business partners process orders manage inventory process shipments to customers and operate other critical functions the ongoing maintenance and security of this information is pertinent to the success of our business operations and our strategic goals 

despite our implementation of network security measures our network may be vulnerable to cybersecurity attacks computer viruses breakins and similar disruptions our network security measures include but are not limited to the implementation of firewalls antivirus protection patches log monitors routine backups offsite storage network audits employee training and routine updates and modifications despite our efforts to create these security barriers we may not be able to keep pace as new threats emerge and it is virtually impossible for us to entirely eliminate this risk cybersecurity attacks are evolving and include but are not limited to malicious software attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation operating results and financial condition and no assurance can be given that our efforts to reduce the risk of such attacks will be successful 

in addition our it systems may be susceptible to damage disruptions instability or shutdowns due to power outages hardware failures telecommunication failures user errors implementation of new operational systems or software or upgrades to existing systems and software catastrophes or other unforeseen events such events could result in the disruption of business processes network degradation and system downtime along with the potential that a third party will exploit our critical assets such as intellectual property proprietary business information and data related to our customers suppliers and business partners further such events could result in loss of revenue loss of or reduction in purchase orders inability to report financial information litigation regulatory fines and penalties and other damage that could have a material impact on our business operations to the extent that such disruptions occur our customers and partners may lose confidence in our solutions and we may lose business or brand reputation resulting in a material and adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

we are or will be subject to ongoing tax examinations of our tax returns by the irs and other tax authorities an adverse outcome of any such audit or examination by the irs or other tax authority could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

we are or will be subject to ongoing tax examinations of our tax returns by the irs and other tax authorities in various jurisdictions we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from ongoing tax examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes these assessments can require considerable estimates and judgments intercompany transactions associated with the sale of inventory services intellectual property and cost sharing arrangements are complex and affect our tax liabilities the calculation of our tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in multiple jurisdictions the outcomes of these tax examinations could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition due to the complexity of tax contingencies the ultimate resolution of any tax matters related to operations may result in payments greater or less than amounts accrued 

our operations may be adversely impacted by changes in our business mix or changes in the tax legislative landscape 

our effective tax rate may be adversely impacted by among other things changes in the mix of our earnings among countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets and changes in tax 

  

laws we cannot give any assurance as to what our effective tax rate will be in the future because among other things there is uncertainty regarding the tax policies of the jurisdictions where we operate changes in tax laws such as tax reform in the united states or changes in tax laws resulting from the organization for economic cooperation and development’s “oecd” multijurisdictional plan of action to address “base erosion and profit shifting” and the taxation of the “digital economy” could impact our effective tax rate 

if tax laws or incentives change or cease to be in effect our income taxes could increase significantly 

we are subject to federal state and local taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions we devote significant resources to evaluating our tax positions and our worldwide provision for taxes our financial results and tax treatment are susceptible to changes in tax accounting and other laws regulations principles and interpretations in the united states and in other jurisdictions where we do business with the existence of economic and political policies that favor domestic interests it is possible that more countries will enact tax laws that either increase the tax rates or reduce or change the tax incentives available to multinational companies like ours upon a change in tax laws in any territory where we do significant business we may not be able to maintain our current tax rate or qualify for or maintain the benefits of any tax incentives offered to the extent such incentives are offered 

keysight benefits from tax incentives in several jurisdictions most significantly in singapore and malaysia that will expire or require renewal at various times in the future the tax incentives provide lower rates of taxation on certain classes of income and require thresholds of investments and employment in those jurisdictions based on the current tax environment we believe that we will satisfy such conditions in the future as needed but cannot guarantee that the tax environment will not change or that such conditions will be satisfied if we cannot or do not wish to satisfy all or portions of the tax incentives conditions we may lose the related tax incentives and could be required to refund the benefits that the tax incentives previously provided the singapore tax incentive is due for renewal in 2024 and the malaysia incentive is due for renewal in 2025 based on the current tax environment we believe that we will satisfy such conditions in the future as needed but cannot guarantee that the tax environment will not change or that such conditions will be satisfied we cannot guarantee that we will qualify or wish to qualify for any future incentive regime that may exist in the future as a result our effective tax rate could be higher than it would have been had we maintained the benefits of the tax incentives and could harm our operating results 

our taxes could increase if the existing singapore or malaysia incentives are revoked or are not renewed upon expiration we cannot guarantee that we will qualify for any new incentive regime that may exist in fiscal years 2024 or 2025 respectively if we cannot or do not wish to satisfy all or portions of the tax incentives conditions we may lose the related tax incentives and could be required to refund the benefits that the tax incentives previously provided as a result our effective tax rate could be higher than it would have been had we maintained the benefits of the tax incentives and could harm our operating results after tax 

our business will suffer if we are not able to retain and hire key personnel 

our future success depends partly on the continued service of our key research engineering sales marketing manufacturing executive and administrative personnel including personnel joining our company through acquisitions the markets in which we operate are dynamic and we may need to respond with reorganizations workforce reductions and site closures from time to time we believe our pay levels are competitive within the regions in which we operate however global labor shortages inflationary pressure on wages and increased global attrition have intensified competition for talent in most fields across the geographic areas in which we operate and it may become more difficult to retain key employees if we fail to retain key personnel and are unable to hire highly qualified replacements we may not be able to meet key objectives such as launching effective product innovations and meeting financial goals and maintain or expand our business 

if we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with certain regulations we may be subject to substantial negative financial consequences and civil or criminal penalties 

we and our customers are subject to various significant international federal state and local regulations including but not limited to export regulations sanctions and embargoes packaging data privacy product content environmental health and safety and labor these regulations are complex change frequently and may become more stringent over time we have been required to incur significant expenses to comply with these regulations and to remedy violations of certain importexport regulations any future failure by us to comply with applicable government regulations could also result in cessation of our operations or portions of our operations high financial penalties product recalls or impositions of fines and restrictions on our ability to carry on or expand our operations if demand for our solutions is adversely affected or our costs increase our business would suffer 

our rd manufacturing and distribution operations involve the use of hazardous substances and are regulated under international federal state and local laws governing health and safety and the environment we are also regulated under a 

  

number of international federal state and local laws regarding recycling product packaging and product content requirements we apply strict standards for protection of the environment and occupational health and safety inside and outside the united states even where not subject to regulation imposed by foreign governments we believe that our properties and operations at our facilities comply in all material respects with applicable environmental and occupational health and safety laws in spite of these efforts no assurance can be given that we will be compliant with all applicable environmental and workplace health and safety laws and regulations and violations could result in civil or criminal sanctions fines and penalties 

we have developed internal data handling policies and practices to comply with the general data protection regulation “gdpr” in the european union and data privacy regulations similar to gdpr in other jurisdictions our existing business strategy does not rely on aggregating or selling personally identifiable information and as a general matter keysight does not process personally identifiable information on behalf of our customers we devote resources to keep up with the changing regulatory environment on data privacy in the jurisdictions where we do business despite our efforts no assurance can be given that we will be compliant with data privacy regulations new laws amendments or interpretations of regulations industry standards and contractual obligations relating to data privacy may require us to incur additional costs and restrict our business operations if we fail to comply with gdpr or other data privacy regulation we may be subject to significant financial fines and civil or criminal penalties and may suffer damage to our reputation or brand which could adversely affect our business and financial results 

in addition our products and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies like the international standards organization as well as regulation by other agencies such as the us federal communications commission we also must comply with work safety rules if we fail to adequately address any of these regulations our businesses could be harmed 

failure to comply with anticorruption laws could adversely affect our business and result in financial penalties 

because we have extensive international operations we must comply with complex foreign and us laws and regulations such as the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials and anticompetition regulations although we actively maintain policies and procedures designed to ensure ongoing compliance with these laws and regulations there can be no assurance that our employees contractors or agents will not violate these policies and procedures violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties criminal sanctions restrictions on our business conduct and on our ability to offer our solutions in one or more countries and could also materially affect our brand ability to attract and retain employees international operations business and operating results 

our business and financial results may be adversely affected by various legal and regulatory proceedings 

we are subject to legal proceedings lawsuits and other claims in the normal course of business and could become subject to additional claims in the future some of which could be material on january 1 2022 centripetal networks filed a lawsuit in federal district court in virginia alleging that certain keysight products infringe certain of centripetal’s patents in addition in february 2022 centripetal filed complaints in germany alleging infringement of certain of centripetal’s german patents and in april 2022 centripetal filed a complaint with the international trade commission “itc” requesting that they investigate whether keysight should be enjoined from importing certain products that are manufactured outside of the us and alleged to infringe centripetal patents although we deny the allegations and intend to aggressively defend each case the outcome of existing proceedings lawsuits and claims may differ from our expectations because the outcomes of litigation are often difficult to reliably predict various factors or developments can lead us to change current estimates of liabilities and related insurance receivables where applicable or permit us to make such estimates for matters previously not susceptible to reasonable estimates such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment a significant settlement significant regulatory developments or changes in applicable law a future adverse ruling settlement or unfavorable development could result in charges that could adversely affect our business operating results or financial condition 

our internal controls may be determined to be ineffective which may adversely affect investor confidence in our company the value of our stock and our access to capital 

the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 requires us to furnish a report by management on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting among other things we devote significant resources and time to comply with such internal control over financial reporting requirements however we cannot be certain that these measures will ensure that we design implement and maintain adequate control over our financial processes and reporting in the future especially in the context of acquisitions of other businesses any difficulties in the assimilation of acquired businesses into our control system could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations inferior internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our stock or on our access to capital or cause us to be subject to investigation or sanctions by the sec 

  

adverse conditions in the global banking industry and credit markets may adversely impact the value of our cash investments or impair our liquidity 

our cash and cash equivalents are invested or held in a mix of money market funds time deposit accounts and bank demand deposit accounts disruptions in the financial markets may in some cases result in an inability to access assets such as money market funds that traditionally have been viewed as highly liquid any failure of our counterparty financial institutions or funds in which we have invested may adversely impact our cash and cash equivalent positions and in turn our results and financial condition 

future investment returns on pension assets may be lower than expected or interest rates may decline requiring us to make significant additional cash contributions to our future plans 

we sponsor several defined benefit pension plans that cover many of our salaried and hourly employees the federal pension protection act of 2006 requires that certain capitalization levels be maintained in each of the us plans and there may be similar funding requirements in the plans outside the united states because it is unknown what the investment return on and the fair value of our pension assets will be in future years or what interest rates and discount rates may be at any point in time no assurances can be given that applicable law will not require us to make future material plan contributions any such contributions could adversely affect our financial condition 

environmental contamination from past operations could subject us to unreimbursed costs and could harm onsite operations and the future use and value of the properties involved and environmental contamination caused by ongoing operations could subject us to substantial liabilities in the future 

some of our properties have been the subject of remediation by hp inc hp for subsurface contaminations that were known at the time of agilents separation from hp in 1999 in connection with agilents separation from hp hp and agilent entered into an agreement pursuant to which hp agreed to retain the liability for this subsurface contamination perform the required remediation and indemnify agilent with respect to claims arising out of that contamination agilent has assigned its rights and obligations under this agreement to keysight in respect of facilities transferred to us in the separation as a result hp will have access to a limited number of our properties to perform remediation although hp agreed to minimize interference with onsite operations at such properties remediation activities and subsurface contamination may require us to incur unreimbursed costs and could harm onsite operations and the future use and value of the properties in connection with the separation agilent will indemnify us directly for any liabilities related thereto we cannot be sure that hp will continue to fulfill its remediation obligations or that agilent will continue to fulfill its indemnification obligations 

on december 17 2021 keysight and hp signed a restrictive covenant related to our santa rosa facility which prohibits certain uses of the property such as running a daycare facility hospital or school and terminates hp’s remediation obligation related to that facility hp’s remediation obligations relating to keysight’s colorado springs facility are ongoing  

our current manufacturing processes involve the use of substances regulated under various international federal state and local laws governing the environment as a result we may become subject to liabilities for environmental contamination and these liabilities may be substantial although our policy is to apply strict standards for environmental protection at our sites inside and outside the united states even if the sites outside the united states are not subject to regulations imposed by foreign governments we may not be aware of all conditions that could subject us to liability

in addition when the market price of a company’s shares drops significantly shareholders often institute securities class action lawsuits against the company a lawsuit against us could cause us to incur substantial costs and could divert the time and attention of management and other resources 

we do not currently pay dividends on our common stock 

we do not currently pay dividends on our common stock the payment of any dividends in the future and the timing and amount thereof to our stockholders fall within the discretion of our board of directors the boards decisions regarding the payment of dividends will depend on many factors such as our financial condition earnings capital requirements debt service obligations restrictive covenants in our debt industry practice legal requirements regulatory constraints and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant we cannot guarantee that we will pay a dividend in the future or continue to pay any dividends if we commence paying dividends 

certain provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and of delaware law may prevent or delay an acquisition of the company which could decrease the trading price of our common stock 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain and delaware law contains provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by making such practices or bids unacceptably expensive to the bidder and to encourage prospective acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover these provisions include but are not limited to

in addition because we have not chosen to be exempt from section 203 of the delaware general corporation law the dgcl this provision could also delay or prevent a change of control that some shareholders may favor section 203 provides that subject to limited exceptions persons that acquire or are affiliated with a person that acquires more than 15 percent of the outstanding voting stock of a delaware corporation an interested stockholder shall not engage in any business combination with that corporation including by merger consolidation or acquisitions of additional shares for a threeyear period following the date on which the person became an interested stockholder unless i prior to such time the board of directors of such corporation approved either the business combination or the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder ii upon consummation of the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder the interested stockholder owned at least 85 percent of the voting stock of such corporation at the time the transaction commenced excluding for purposes of determining the voting stock outstanding but not the outstanding voting stock owned by the interested stockholder the voting stock owned by directors who are also officers or held in employee benefit plans in which the employees do not have a confidential right to tender or vote stock held by the plan or iii on or subsequent to such time the business combination is approved by the board of directors of such corporation and authorized at a meeting of shareholders by the affirmative vote of at least twothirds of the outstanding voting stock of such corporation not owned by the interested stockholder 

we believe these provisions will protect our shareholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors and by providing our board of directors with more time to assess any acquisition proposal these provisions are not intended to make us immune from takeovers however these provisions will apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some shareholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that our board of directors determines is not in the best interests of the company and our shareholders these provisions may also prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates that the state courts in the state of delaware or if no state court located within the state of delaware has jurisdiction the federal court for the district of delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our shareholders which could discourage lawsuits against the company and our directors and officers

net income was 1124 million in 2022 compared to net income of 894 million and 627 million in 2021 and 2020 respectively the increase in net income for 2022 when compared to 2021 was primarily driven by higher revenue volume lower amortization of acquisitionrelated balances and lower variable peoplerelated costs partially offset by higher material costs and higher selling general and administrative rd and income tax expenses the increase in net income for 2021 when compared to 2020 was primarily driven by higher revenue volume lower amortization of acquisitionrelated balances and lower income tax expense partially offset by an increase in variable peoplerelated costs higher rd investments lower operating income due to a onetime priorperiod gain related to an insurance settlement a loss on a partial settlement of our netherlands defined benefit plan and the incremental costs of acquired businesses in 2022 2021 and 2020 we generated operating cash flows of 1144 million 1322 million and 1016 million respectively

currency exchange rate exposure 

our revenues costs and expenses and monetary assets and liabilities are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our global operating and financing activities we hedge revenues expenses and balance sheet exposures that are not denominated in the functional currencies of our subsidiaries on a shortterm and anticipated basis the result of the hedging has been included in our consolidated statement of operations we experience some fluctuations within individual lines of the consolidated balance sheet and consolidated statement of operations because our hedging program is not designed to offset the currency movements in each category of revenues expenses monetary assets and liabilities our cash flow hedging program is designed to hedge shortterm currency movements based on a rolling period of up to twelve months therefore we are exposed to currency fluctuations over the longer term to the extent that we are required to pay for all or portions of an acquisition price in foreign currencies we may enter into foreign exchange contracts to reduce the risk that currency movements will impact the us dollar cost of the transaction

gross margin operating margin and income before taxes 

gross margin increased 2 percentage points in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily driven by lower amortization of acquisitionrelated balances price increases higher revenue volume and lower variable peoplerelated costs partially offset by higher material costs gross margin increased 2 percentage points in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily driven by lower amortization of acquisitionrelated balances and higher revenue volume partially offset by higher variable peoplerelated costs 

excess and obsolete inventory charges were 27 million in 2022 27 million in 2021 and 29 million in 2020 

research and development expense increased 4 percent in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily driven by investments in key growth opportunities in our end markets and leadingedge technologies as well as incremental costs of acquired businesses 

  

partially offset by lower variable peoplerelated costs research and development expense increased 13 percent in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily driven by greater investments in key growth opportunities in our end markets and leadingedge technologies an increase in variable peoplerelated costs and incremental costs of acquired businesses 

selling general and administrative expenses increased 7 percent in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily driven by increased investment in sales resources higher infrastructurerelated travel and marketingrelated costs as well as incremental costs of acquired businesses partially offset by lower variable peoplerelated costs selling general and administrative expenses increased 9 percent in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily driven by increases in variable and other peoplerelated costs infrastructurerelated costs and incremental costs of acquired businesses partially offset by reductions in travel and marketingrelated costs due to covid19 related disruptions 

other operating expense income net was income of 8 million 17 million and 44 million for 2022 2021 and 2020 respectively the decrease in net other operating income in 2022 was primarily driven by asset impairment charges related to the discontinuance of our russia operations other operating expense income net for 2020 includes a onetime gain of 32 million on an insurance settlement 

operating margin increased 3 percentage points in 2022 when compared to 2021 primarily driven by gross margin gains and lower operating expenses as a percentage of sales operating margin increased 4 percentage points in 2021 when compared to 2020 primarily driven by gross margin gains and lower operating expenses as a percentage of sales 

our headcount was approximately 15000 at october 31 2022 compared to approximately 14300 at october 31 2021 

interest income and expense 

interest income for 2022 2021 and 2020 was 16 million 3 million and 11 million respectively and primarily relates to interest earned on our cash balances interest expense for 2022 2021 and 2020 was 79 million 79 million and 78 million respectively and primarily relates to interest on our senior notes 

other income expense net 

other income expense net for 2022 2021 and 2020 was income of 14 million 6 million and 63 million respectively and primarily includes net income related to our defined benefit and postretirement benefit plans interest cost expected return on assets amortization of net actuarial loss and prior service credits and gains losses on settlements and curtailments and the change in fair value of our equity investments the increase in net other income for 2022 when compared to 2021 was primarily driven by 38 million lower amortization of net actuarial losses and a 2021 loss on a partial settlement of a nonus pension plan partially offset by a 31 million loss on our equity investments the decrease in net other income for 2021 when compared to 2020 was driven by a 16 million loss on the partial settlement of our netherlands defined benefit plan and higher amortization of net actuarial losses we also recognized gains from insurance proceeds of 9 million for the year ended october 31 2020 

income taxes 



the effective tax rate was 13 percent 11 percent and 18 percent for 2022 2021 and 2020 respectively the tax rate in each of these years was lower than the us statutory rate primarily due to the proportion of worldwide earnings that are taxed at lower statutory tax rates in nonus jurisdictions partially offset by us tax imposed on earnings in nonus jurisdictions 

the increase in the effective tax rate from 2021 to 2022 was due to nonrecurring tax benefits recorded in 2021 partially offset by a decrease in 2022 taxes from changes in tax reserves primarily due to audit settlement and from a relative decrease in us tax due on nonus earnings the 2022 tax expense also includes a decrease in tax expense resulting from an outofperiod adjustment to tax reserves for fiscal years 2019 through 2021 related to the potential us benefit associated with the future resolution of nonus tax reserves the 2022 decrease in tax expense was partially offset by an increase to tax expense resulting from an outofperiod adjustment related to corrections to the tax rate applied to nonus pension deferred tax balances neither of these outofperiod adjustments were material individually or in the aggregate the 2021 significant nonrecurring tax benefits include the release of valuation allowance on netherlands net operating losses in 2021 and a decrease 

  

due to the 2021 actual tax impact of acquired entity integration as compared to the estimate at acquisition based on the finalization of the integration plan the decrease in the effective tax rate from 2020 to 2021 was due to a change in the jurisdictional mix of nonus earnings partially offset by an increase in us taxes on nonus earnings and the 2021 nonrecurring tax benefits described above 

keysight benefits from tax incentives in several jurisdictions most significantly in singapore and malaysia that will expire or require renewal at various times in the future the tax incentives provide lower rates of taxation on certain classes of income and require thresholds of investments and employment in those jurisdictions the singapore tax incentive is due for renewal in 2024 and the malaysia incentive is due for renewal in 2025 we are continuing to evaluate renewal options and the impact of potential outcomes on our effective tax rate the impact of the tax incentives decreased income taxes by 81 million 70 million and 53 million in 2022 2021 and 2020 respectively the increase in tax benefit from 2021 to 2022 is primarily due to a change in the jurisdictional mix of nonus earnings which increased the earnings taxed at incentive tax rates in 2022 

the calculation of our tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex tax law and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions although the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes the use of a recognition and measurement model the determination of whether an uncertain tax position has met those thresholds will continue to require significant judgment by management in accordance with the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes for all us and other tax jurisdictions we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes and interest will be due we include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes in the consolidated statements of operations accrued interest and penalties are included on the related tax liability line in the consolidated balance sheet 

the open tax years for the us federal income tax return and most state income tax returns are from november 1 2017 through the current tax year for the majority of our foreign entities the open tax years are from november 1 2017 through the current tax year for certain foreign entities the tax years remain open at most back to the year 2008 

keysight’s fiscal year 2018 us federal income tax return was under examination by the internal revenue service the tax cuts and jobs act tcja was enacted in december 2017 and imposed a onetime us tax on foreign earnings not previously repatriated to the us known as the transition tax which was reported in keysight’s fiscal year 2018 us federal income tax return as of june 2022 the fiscal year 2018 us federal income tax audit was effectively settled with no material assessments and no additional cash taxes paid 

the company is being audited in malaysia for fiscal year 2008 this tax year predates our separation from agilent however pursuant to the agreement between agilent and keysight pertaining to tax matters as finalized at the time of separation for certain entities including malaysia any historical tax liability is the responsibility of keysight in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017 keysight paid income taxes and penalties of 68 million on gains related to intellectual property rights the company believes there are numerous defenses to the current assessment the statute of limitations for the fiscal year 2008 in malaysia was closed and the income in question is exempt from tax in malaysia the company is disputing this assessment and pursuing all avenues to resolve this issue favorably for the company our appeals to both the special commissioners of income tax and the high court in malaysia have been unsuccessful we have filed a notice of appeal with the court of appeal and a hearing is currently scheduled for 2023 

at this time management does not believe that the outcome of any future or currently ongoing examination will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements we believe that we have an adequate provision for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations however the outcome of tax examinations cannot be predicted with certainty given the numerous tax years and matters that remain subject to examination in various tax jurisdictions the ultimate resolution of current and future tax examinations could be inconsistent with management’s current expectations if that were to occur it could have an impact on our effective tax rate in the period in which such examinations are resolved 

a provision enacted in the tcja requiring us tax research and experimental expenditures to be capitalized and amortized over five years for research activities conducted in the us and fifteen years for research activities conducted outside of the us will be effective for keysight beginning november 1 2022 if this provision is not deferred the capitalization is expected to increase us taxable income and increase the us federal foreignderived intangible income tax deduction as keysight has elected to treat global intangible lowtaxed income “gilti” as a period cost the capitalization will also increase the provision for income taxes on august 16 2022 the us government enacted the inflation reduction act of 2022 that includes changes to the us corporate income tax system including a fifteen percent minimum tax based on adjusted financial statement income which is effective for keysight beginning november 1 2023 and a one percent excise tax on repurchases of stock after december 31 2022 we are continuing to evaluate the impact of these changes in us tax law as well as its application to our business

operating margin in 2022 was flat when compared to 2021 primarily driven by lower operating expenses as a percentage of sales partially offset by gross margin declines operating margin increased 4 percentage points in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily driven by gross margin gains from higher revenue volume and favorable mix and lower operating expenses as a percentage of sales 

financial condition 

liquidity and capital resources 

our liquidity is affected by many factors some of which are based on normal ongoing operations of our business and some of which arise from fluctuations related to global economics and markets our cash balances are generated and held in many locations throughout the world under certain circumstances local government regulations may limit our ability to move cash balances to meet cash needs we do not currently expect such regulations and restrictions to impact our ability to pay vendors and conduct operations throughout our global organization 

overview of cash flows 

our key cash flow activities were as follows 



operating activities 

cash flows from operating activities can fluctuate significantly from period to period as working capital needs the timing of payments for income taxes variable pay pension funding and other items impact reported cash flows 

net cash provided by operating activities decreased by 178 million in 2022 as compared to 2021 and increased 306 million in 2021 as compared to 2020 

• net income in 2022 increased 230 million as compared to 2021 noncash adjustments to net income were higher by 32 million primarily due to a 60 million decrease in deferred tax benefits a 31 million unrealized loss on investment in equity securities a 22 million increase in sharebased compensation expense and a 7 million impairment of assets partially offset by a 70 million decrease in amortization a 16 million lower pension settlement loss and a 2 million decrease from other miscellaneous noncash activities 

net income in 2021 increased 267 million as compared to 2020 noncash adjustments to net income were lower by 54 million primarily due to a 94 million increase in deferred tax benefits and a 46 million decrease in amortization partially offset by a onetime priorperiod gain of 32 million related to an insurance recovery of property plant and equipment reflected as cash from investing activity a 16 million loss on a partial settlement of our netherlands defined benefit plan a 13 million increase in depreciation a 11 million increase in sharebased compensation expense and a 14 million increase from other miscellaneous noncash activities 

• the aggregate of accounts receivable inventory and accounts payable used net cash of 273 million during 2022 compared to net cash used of 112 million in 2021 and 31 million in 2020 the increase in aggregate net cash used in 2022 is primarily driven by higher revenue volume net of collections and an increase in inventory due to higher material procurement costs and incremental stock buildup to secure supply the amount of cash flow generated from or used by the aggregate of accounts receivable inventory and accounts payable depends on the cash conversion cycle which represents the number of days that elapse from the day we pay for the purchase of raw materials and components to the collection of cash from our customers and can be significantly impacted by the timing of shipments and purchases as well as collections and payments in a period 

• net cash used for retirement and postretirement benefits was 19 million in 2022 compared to net cash provided of 7 million in 2021 and net cash used of 108 million in 2020 the companys contributions to our us defined benefit plan were zero zero and 100 million in 2022 2021 and 2020 respectively the companys contributions to our nonus defined benefit plans were 7 million 8 million and 10 million in 2022 2021 and 2020 respectively we did not contribute to the keysight technologies inc health plan for retirees us postretirement benefit plan in 2022 2021 and 2020 

  

• the aggregate other movements in assets and liabilities used net cash of 112 million during 2022 compared to net cash provided of 141 million in 2021 and 82 million in 2020 the difference between 2022 and 2021 cash flows is primarily due to higher prepaid inventory deposits driven by supply chain constraints higher income tax payments net of accruals higher variable compensation and other payrollrelated payments net of accruals higher prepaid expenses and changes in deferred revenue the difference between 2021 and 2020 cash flows is primarily due to higher variable compensation accruals net of payments and higher cash inflow from deferred revenue partially offset by an increase in prepaid current assets as compared to the same period last year 

investing activities 

net cash changes in investing activities primarily relates to investments in property plant and equipment and acquisitions of businesses to support our growth 

net cash used in investing activities decreased by 102 million in 2022 as compared to 2021 and decreased by 89 million in 2021 as compared to 2020 investments in property plant and equipment increased 11 million as compared to 2021 and increased 57 million in 2021 as compared to 2020 the increase in capital spending in 2022 was driven by capital investments to increase the resiliency of our supply chains 

in 2022 we used 251 million for investing activities including 185 million for purchases of property plant and equipment 33 million net of cash acquired for acquisition activities and 33 million for investments including 30 million for purchase of an equity investment 

in 2021 we used 353 million for investing activities including 174 million for purchases of property plant and equipment 102 million net of 11 million of cash acquired for the acquisition of sanjole inc and 76 million net of cash acquired for other acquisition activities 

in 2020 we used 442 million for investing activities including 117 million for purchases of property plant and equipment 319 million net of 11 million of cash acquired for the acquisition of eggplant topco limited eggplant and 38 million net of cash acquired for other acquisition activities partially offset by receipt of insurance proceeds of 32 million for property plant and equipment damaged in the 2017 northern california wildfires 

financing activities 

net cash changes in financing activities primarily relate to proceeds from issuance of common stock under employee stock plans tax payments related to net share settlement of equity awards and treasury stock repurchases 

net cash used in financing activities increased by 190 million in 2022 as compared to 2021 and increased by 258 million in 2021 as compared to 2020 the incremental increases were primarily due to treasury stock repurchases 

in 2022 we used 861 million for financing activities including 849 million of treasury stock repurchases and 74 million of tax payments related to net share settlement of equity awards partially offset by 63 million of proceeds from issuance of common stock under employee stock plans 

in 2021 we used 671 million for financing activities including 673 million of treasury stock repurchases and 53 million of tax payments related to net share settlement of equity awards partially offset by 59 million of proceeds from issuance of common stock under employee stock plans 

in 2020 we used 413 million for financing activities including 411 million of treasury stock repurchases and 53 million of tax payments related to net share settlement of equity awards and 7 million of payments on shortterm debt partially offset by 58 million of proceeds from issuance of common stock under employee stock plans 

treasury stock repurchases 

on november 18 2021 our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing the purchase of up to 1200 million of the company’s common stock replacing the previously approved november 2020 program under which 77 million remained the stock repurchase program may be commenced suspended or discontinued at any time at the company’s discretion and does not have an expiration date see issuer purchases of equity securities under part ii item 2 for additional information 

  

debt 



on july 30 2021 we entered into a new credit agreement that amended and restated our existing credit agreement dated february 15 2017 in its entirety and provides for a 750 million fiveyear unsecured revolving credit facility the “revolving credit facility” that will expire on july 30 2026 and bears interest at an annual rate of libor  1 percent along with a facility fee of 0125 percent per annum in addition the new credit agreement permits the company subject to certain customary conditions on one or more occasions to request to increase the total commitments under the revolving credit facility by up to 250 million in the aggregate we may use amounts borrowed under the facility for general corporate purposes as of october 31 2022 and october 31 2021 we had no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility we were in compliance with the covenants of the revolving credit facility during the year ended october 31 2022 see note 11 debt for additional information 

cash and cash requirements 

cash 



our cash and cash equivalents mainly consist of investments in institutional money market funds shortterm deposits held at major global financial institutions and similar short duration instruments with original maturities of three months or less we continuously monitor the creditworthiness of the financial institutions and money market fund asset managers with whom we invest our funds we utilize a variety of funding strategies in an effort to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed most significant international locations have access to internal funding through an offshore cash pool for working capital needs in addition a few locations that are unable to access internal funding have access to temporary local overdraft and shortterm working capital lines of credit 

cash requirements 

we have cash requirements to support working capital needs capital expenditures business acquisitions contractual obligations commitments principal and interest payments on debt and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations w e generally intend to use available cash and funds generated from our operations to meet these cash requirements but in the event that additional liquidity is required we may also borrow under our revolving credit facility 

the following table summarizes our short and longterm cash requirements as of october 31 2022 



senior notes obligations and interest payments on senior notes we have contractual obligations for principal and interest payments on our senior notes see note 11 debt for additional information 

  

operating lease commitments commitments under operating leases primarily relates to leasehold properties see note 10 leases for additional information 

commitments to contract manufacturers and suppliers we purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products see note 14 commitments and contingencies as of october 31 2022 we had noncancellable purchase commitments that aggregated to approximately 553 million of which the majority is for less than one year 

other purchase commitments other purchase commitments relate to contracts with professional services suppliers see note 14 commitments and contingencies 

other liabilities other liabilities primarily includes contract liabilities net pensions and postretirement benefit obligations employee compensation and benefits net tax liabilities standard warranties and other accrued liabilities the timing of cash flows associated with these obligations is based upon management’s estimates over the terms of these arrangements and is largely based upon historical experience 

of the tax liabilities included in the above table 59 million relates to a us transition tax liability and 136 million for uncertain tax positions the remaining us transition tax liability which keysight originally elected to pay over 8 years is payable over the next 4 years and relates to a onetime us tax on those earnings that had not been previously repatriated to the us with regard to the 136 million of longterm liabilities for uncertain tax positions we are unable to accurately predict when these amounts will be realized or released we believe that we have an adequate provision for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations however the outcome of tax examinations cannot be predicted with certainty given the numerous tax years and matters that remain subject to examination in various tax jurisdictions the ultimate resolution of current and future tax examinations could be inconsistent with management’s current expectations see note 5 “income taxes” for additional information 

in addition to the obligations noted above as of october 31 2022 we had 38 million of outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds unrelated to the credit facility that were issued by various lenders 

for the next twelve months we do not expect to contribute to our us defined benefit plan and us postretirement benefit plan and we expect to contribute 11 million to our nonus defined benefit plans the ultimate amounts we will contribute depend upon among other things legal requirements underlying asset returns the plan’s funded status the anticipated tax deductibility of the contribution local practices market conditions interest rates and other factors see note 12 retirements plans and postretirements benefits 

additionally we expect capital spending to be approximately 250 million in 2023 with greater investments in capacity expansion and technology investments 

as of october 31 2022 we believe our cash and cash equivalents cash generated from operations and our ability to access capital markets and credit lines will satisfy our cash needs for the foreseeable future both globally and domestically 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable although these estimates are based on managements best knowledge of current events and actions that may impact the company in the future actual results may be different from the estimates we are not aware of any specific event or circumstance that would require an update to our estimates or judgments or a revision of the carrying value of our assets or liabilities as of october 31 2022 an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur could materially change the financial statements our critical accounting policies are those that affect our financial statements materially and involve difficult subjective or complex judgments by management those policies are revenue recognition inventory valuation sharebased compensation retirement and postretirement plan assumptions valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets warranty loss contingencies restructuring and accounting for income taxes 

revenue recognition revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of the promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services we primarily generate revenue from the sale of products hardware andor software services or a combination thereof we enter into contracts that 

  

may involve multiple performance obligations and we allocate the transaction price between each performance obligation on the basis of relative standalone selling price “ssp” we recognize revenue following the fivestep model 

1 identify the contract with a customer generally we consider customer purchase orders which in some cases are governed by master sales or other purchase agreements to be the customer contract all of the following criteria must be met before we consider an agreement to qualify as a contract with a customer under the revenue standard i it must be approved by all parties ii each party’s rights regarding the goods and services to be transferred can be identified iii the payment terms for the goods and services can be identified iv the agreement has commercial substance and v the customer has the ability and intent to pay and collection of substantially all of the consideration is probable we exercise reasonable judgment to determine the customer’s ability and intent to pay which is based upon various factors including the customer’s historical payment experience or credit and financial information and credit risk management measures that we implement 

2 identify the performance obligations in the contract we assess whether each promised good or service is distinct for the purpose of identifying the various performance obligations in each contract promised goods and services are considered distinct provided that i the customer can benefit from the good or service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer and ii our promise to transfer the good or service to the customer is separately identifiable or distinct from other promises in the contract 

3 determine the transaction price transaction price reflects the amount of consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services our contracts may include terms that could cause variability in the transaction price including rebates rights of return tradein credits and discounts variable consideration is generally accounted for at the portfolio level and estimated based on historical information 

4 allocate the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract if the contract contains a single performance obligation the entire transaction price is allocated to that performance obligation many of our contracts include multiple performance obligations with a combination of distinct products and services maintenance and support professional services andor training for contracts with multiple performance obligations we allocate the total transaction value to each distinct performance obligation based on relative ssp judgment is required to determine the ssp for each distinct performance obligation the best evidence of ssp is the observable price of a good or service when we sell that good or service separately under similar circumstances to similar customers since most contracts contain multiple performance obligations we use information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs to estimate ssp when we don’t have standalone transactions 

5 recognize revenue when or as performance obligations are satisfied revenue is recognized at the point in time control is transferred to the customer for hardware sales transfer of control to the customer typically occurs at the point the product is shipped or delivered to the customer’s designated location for software license sales transfer of control to the customer typically occurs upon shipment electronic delivery or when the software is available for download by the customer for sales of implementation service and custom solutions or in instances where products are sold along with essential installation services transfer of control occurs and revenue is typically recognized upon customer acceptance for fixedprice support and extended warranty contracts or certain software arrangements that provide customers with a right to access over a discrete period control is deemed to transfer over time and revenue is recognized on a straightline basis over the contract term due to the standready nature of the performance obligation revenue from hardware repairs and calibration services outside of an extended warranty or support contract is recognized at the time of completion of the related service for other professional services or timebased labor contracts revenue is recognized as we perform the services and the customers receive andor consume the benefits 

inventory valuation we assess the valuation of our inventory on a periodic basis and make adjustments to the value for estimated excess and obsolete inventory based upon estimates about future demand and actual usage such estimates are difficult to make under most economic conditions the excess balance determined by this analysis becomes the basis for our excess inventory charge our excess inventory review process includes analysis of sales forecasts managing product rollovers and working with manufacturing and sales to maximize recovery of excess inventory if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management additional writedowns may be required if actual market conditions are more favorable than anticipated inventory previously written down may be sold to customers resulting in lower cost of sales and higher income from operations than expected in that period 

sharebased compensation we account for sharebased awards in accordance with the provisions of the authoritative accounting guidance which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all sharebased payment awards made to our employees and directors awards granted under the keysight technologies inc longterm performance ltp program are based on a variety of targets such as total shareholder return tsr or financial metrics such as 

  

operating margin the awards based on tsr were valued using a monte carlo simulation model and those based on financial metrics were valued based on the market price of keysight’s common stock on the date of grant the compensation cost for financial metricsbased performance awards reflect the cost of awards that are probable to vest at the end of the performance period the monte carlo simulation fair value model requires the use of highly subjective and complex assumptions including the price volatility of the underlying stock for additional information on valuation assumptions see note 4 “sharebased compensation” the estimated fair value of restricted stock awards is determined based on the market price of keysight’s common stock on the date of grant we did not grant any option awards in 2022 2021 and 2020 

retirement and postretirement benefit plan assumptions retirement and postretirement benefit plan costs are a significant cost of doing business they represent obligations that will ultimately be settled sometime in the future and therefore are subject to estimation defined benefit plan obligations are remeasured at least annually as of october 31 based on the present value of future benefit payments to reflect the future benefit costs over the employees average expected future service to keysight based on the terms of the plans to estimate the present value of these future payments we are required to make assumptions using actuarial concepts within the framework of gaap the discount rate is a critical assumption other important assumptions include expected longterm return on plan assets expected future salary increases expected future increases to benefit payments expected retirement dates employee turnover retiree mortality rates and investment portfolio composition we evaluate these assumptions at least annually see note 12 retirement plans and postretirement benefit plans 

the discount rate is used to determine the present value of future benefit payments at the measurement date which is october 31 for both us and nonus plans the us discount rates as of october 31 2022 and 2021 were determined based on the results of matching expected plan benefit payments with cash flows from a hypothetically constructed bond portfolio the nonus discount rates as of october 31 2022 and 2021 were determined using spot rates along the yield curve to calculate disaggregated discount rates in addition we used this method to calculate two components of the periodic benefit cost service cost and interest cost if we changed our discount rate by 1 percent the impact would be 7 million on us net periodic benefit cost and 8 million on nonus net periodic benefit cost lower discount rates increase the present value of the liability and subsequent year pension expense higher discount rates decrease the present value of the liability and subsequent year pension expense 

the company uses alternate methods of amortization as allowed by the authoritative guidance that amortizes the actuarial gains and losses on a consistent basis for the years presented for us plans gains and losses are amortized over the average future working lifetime for most nonus plans and us postretirement benefit plans gains and losses are amortized using a separate layer for each years gains and losses the expected longterm return on plan assets is estimated using current and expected asset allocations as well as historical and expected returns plan assets are valued at fair value if we changed our estimated return on assets by 1 percent the impact would be 10 million on us net periodic benefit cost and 11 million on nonus net periodic benefit cost 

goodwill and other intangible assets we review goodwill for impairment annually during our fourth fiscal quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable as defined in the authoritative guidance a reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment at the time of an acquisition we assign goodwill to the reporting unit that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination 

companies have the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether performing a quantitative test is necessary if an entity believes as a result of its qualitative assessment that it is morelikelythannot that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount the quantitative impairment test will be required otherwise no further testing will be required 

the quantitative impairment test involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount including goodwill we determine the fair value of a reporting unit using the results derived using the market approach when available and appropriate or the income approach or a combination of both if multiple valuation methodologies are used the results are weighted accordingly the income approach is estimated through the discounted cash flow “dcf” analysis determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgment including judgments about appropriate discount rates revenue growth rates and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows discount rates are based on a weighted average cost of capital “wacc” which represents the average rate a business must pay its providers of debt and equity plus a risk premium the wacc used to test goodwill is derived from a group of comparable companies the cash flows employed in the dcf analysis are derived from internal forecasts and external market forecasts the market approach estimates the fair value of the reporting unit by utilizing the market comparable method which is based on revenue and earnings multiples from comparable companies if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value then an impairment charge is 

  

recorded for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting units fair value up to a maximum amount of the goodwill balance for the reporting unit 

during the fourth quarter of 2022 we performed our annual impairment test of goodwill for all our reporting units using a qualitative approach based on the results of our qualitative testing we believe that it is morelikelythannot that the fair value of each reporting unit is greater than its respective carrying value 

other intangible assets consist primarily of developed technologies proprietary knowhow trademarks customer relationships noncompete agreements and backlog and are amortized using the straightline method over estimated useful lives ranging from 6 months to 12 years we review other intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of these assets are no longer appropriate we performed an impairment test of eggplants longlived assets in 2021 which preceded the quantitative test of goodwill in accordance with the guidance and concluded that no impairment charge was required no impairments of purchased intangible assets were recorded during the years ended october 31 2022 2021 and 2020 

we review indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of these assets are no longer appropriate the authoritative accounting guidance allows a qualitative approach for testing indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment similar to the impairment testing guidance for goodwill it allows the option to first assess qualitative factors events and circumstances that could have affected the significant inputs used in determining the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset the qualitative factors assist in determining whether it is morelikelythannot that the indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired an organization may choose to bypass the qualitative assessment for any indefinitelived intangible asset in any period and proceed directly to calculating its fair value our indefinitelived intangible assets are inprocess research and development iprd intangible assets in 2022 2021 and 2020 we assessed impairment by performing a qualitative test no material impairments of indefinitelived intangible assets were recorded in 2022 2021 and 2020 

warranty keysight warranties on products sold through direct sales channels are primarily for one year warranties for products sold through distribution channels are primarily for three years we accrue for standard warranty costs based on historical trends in warranty charges the accrual is reviewed regularly and periodically adjusted to reflect changes in warranty cost estimates estimated warranty charges are recorded within cost of products at the time related product revenue is recognized 

we also sell extended warranties that provide warranty coverage beyond the standard warranty term revenue associated with extended warranties is deferred and recognized over the extended coverage period 

loss contingencies as discussed in note 13 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements we are from time to time subject to a variety of litigation and similar contingent liabilities incidental to our business or the business operations of previously owned entities we recognize a liability for any contingency that is known or probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable these assessments require judgments concerning matters such as litigation developments and outcomes the anticipated outcome of negotiations the number of future claims and the cost of both pending and future claims in addition because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time liabilities may change in the future due to various factors changes in these factors could materially impact our financial position or our results of operation 

restructuring the main component of our restructuring plan is related to workforce reductions and site restructuring workforce reduction charges are accrued when payment of benefits becomes probable and the amounts can be estimated if the amounts and timing of cash flows from restructuring activities are significantly different from what we have estimated the actual amount of restructuring and other related charges could be materially different either higher or lower than those we have recorded 

accounting for income taxes we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax benefits credits and deductions and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities that arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period 

significant management judgment is also required in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part when it is morelikelythannot that all or some portion of specific deferred tax assets such as net operating losses or foreign tax credit carryforwards will not be realized a valuation allowance must be established for the amount of the deferred tax assets that cannot be realized we consider all available positive and negative evidence on a jurisdictionbyjurisdiction 

  

basis when assessing whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable we consider evidence such as our past operating results the existence of losses in recent years and our forecast of future taxable income at october 31 2022 the company maintains a valuation allowance mainly related to net operating losses in luxembourg and the uk capital losses in the uk and california research credits we intend to maintain a valuation allowance in these jurisdictions until sufficient positive evidence exists to support their reversal 

the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax law and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions although the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes the use of a recognition and measurement model the determination of whether an uncertain tax position has met those thresholds will continue to require significant judgment by management in accordance with the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes for all us and other tax jurisdictions we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes and interest will be due the ultimate resolution of tax uncertainties may differ from what is currently estimated which could result in a material impact on income tax expense if our estimate of income tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment a further charge to expense would be required if events occur and the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary we include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes in the consolidated statements of operations 

new accounting standards 

see note 1 overview and summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements for a description of new accounting pronouncements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

at various times we use derivative financial instruments to limit exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates because derivative instruments are used solely as hedges and not for speculative trading purposes fluctuations in the market values of such derivative instruments are generally offset by reciprocal changes in the underlying economic exposures that the instruments are intended to hedge for further discussion of derivative financial instruments see note 9 derivatives 

currency exchange rate risk 

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks inherent in our sales commitments anticipated sales expenses and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries we hedge future cash flows denominated in currencies other than the functional currency using sales and expense forecasts on a rolling period of up to twelve months our exposure to exchange rate risks is managed on an enterprisewide basis this strategy utilizes derivative financial instruments primarily forward contracts to hedge certain foreign currency exposures with the intent of offsetting gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposures with gains and losses on the derivative contracts hedging them we do not currently and do not intend to utilize derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes to the extent that we are required to pay for all or portions of an acquisition price in foreign currencies we may enter into foreign exchange contracts to reduce the risk that currency movements will impact the cost of the transaction 

our operations generate nonfunctional currency cash flows such as revenue thirdparty vendor payments and intercompany payments in anticipation of these foreign currency cash flows and in view of the volatility of the currency market we enter into foreign exchange contracts as described above to substantially mitigate our currency risk in 2022 2021 and 2020 approximately 77 percent 77 percent and 76 percent of our revenues were generated in us dollars 

the unfavorable effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates principally as a result of the strength of the us dollar had an immaterial impact on our revenue in the year ended october 31 2022 we calculate the impact of foreign currency exchange rates movements by applying the actual foreign currency exchange rates in effect during the last month of each quarter to the current year to both the applicable current and prior year periods we also performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10 percent adverse movement in foreign exchange rates to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above as of october 31 2022 and 2021 the analysis indicated that these hypothetical market movements would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

interest rate risk 

a change in interest rates on longterm debt impacts the fair value of the company’s fixedrate longterm debt but not the company’s earnings or cash flow because the interest on such debt is fixed generally the fair market value of fixedrate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 

as of october 31 2022 a hypothetical 10 percent increase in interest rates would have decreased the fair value of the company’s fixedrate longterm debt by approximately 36 million however since the company currently has no plans to repurchase its outstanding fixedrate instruments before their maturity nor do the investors in our fixedrate debt obligations have the right to demand we pay off these obligations prior to maturity the impact of market interest rate fluctuations on the company’s fixedrate longterm debt does not affect the company’s results of operations or stockholders’ equity

 item 1a risk factors 

risks uncertainties and other factors that may affect future results 

risks related to our business 

global health crises such as the covid19 pandemic have had an impact on our supply chain and could have a material impact on our global operations our customers and vendors which could adversely impact our business results and financial condition 

in march 2020 the world health organization declared covid19 a global pandemic in response to the rapid global spread of the virus national state and local governments issued orders and recommendations to attempt to reduce spread of the disease to protect the health and safety of our employees we temporarily closed our facilities globally and asked employees who can work from home to do so for the foreseeable future employees who were not able to work effectively from home were brought back to work at our sites with strict safety protocols in place which are in compliance with local regulations recommendations from our medical director and guidance from the centers for disease control and the world health organization fluctuation in infection rates have continued and the appearance of new and more easily transmitted variants of covid19 such as the delta variant have resulted in periodic changes in restrictions that vary from region to region and require vigilant attention and rapid response plans to return all employees to keysight facilities at precovid19 levels were temporarily delayed by the emergence of the delta variant 

the uncertain duration and severity of the pandemic caused by covid19 and its variants as well as continued periodic spikes in infection rates local outbreaks of the virus and its variants or potential outbreaks on our sites or supplier customer or vendor sites in spite of safety measures or vaccinations where available could cause disruptions to our operations or those of our suppliers customers or vendors outbreaks causing renewed implementation or extension of existing government orders or new orders or mandates such as governmentimposed vaccine mandates could also impact the availability of our employees or other workers or could lead to attrition of key employees which could further impact our ability to manufacture ship or deliver products and solutions to customers as new variants of the virus appear especially variants that are more easily spread cause more serious outcomes or are resistant to existing vaccines new health orders and safety protocols could further impact our onsite operations and our ability to collaborate globally with customers suppliers and internal colleagues 

the pandemic has led to global supply chain challenges which have adversely impacted our ability to procure certain components and could impact our ability manufacture products and cause delays in delivery of our solutions to our customers global shifts in customer demand and raw material supply due to covid19 could result in delayed or canceled orders and our customers’ reduced spending reduced demand for products and solutions and their inability to pay for products and solutions 

these factors could materially and negatively impact our business results operations revenue growth and overall financial condition 

uncertainty in general economic conditions may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

our business is sensitive to negative changes in general economic conditions both inside and outside the united states global and regional economic uncertainty recession or depression may impact our business resulting in 

• reduced demand for our solutions delays in the shipment of orders or increases in order cancellations 

• increased risk of excess and obsolete inventory 

• increased price pressure for our solutions and services and 

• greater risk of impairment to the value and a detriment to the liquidity of our future investment portfolio 

in addition global and regional macroeconomic developments such as increased unemployment decreased income uncertainty related to future economic activity reduced access to credit volatility in capital markets decreased liquidity uncertain or destabilizing national election results in the us europe and asia and negative changes or volatility in general economic conditions in the us europe and asia could negatively affect our ability to conduct business in those territories financial difficulties experienced by our suppliers and customers including distributors due to economic volatility or negative changes could result in product delays delays in payment or inability to pay us and inventory issues economic risks related to accounts receivable could result in delays in collection and greater bad debt expense 

  

our operating results and financial condition could be harmed if the markets into which we sell our solutions decline or do not grow as anticipated 

visibility into our markets is limited our quarterly sales and operating results are highly dependent on the volume and timing of technologyrelated spending and orders received during the fiscal quarter which are difficult to forecast and may be cancelled by our customers in addition our revenues and earnings forecasts for future fiscal quarters are often based on the expected seasonality or cyclicality of our markets however due to the uncertainties and volatile economic environment created by the continuing global pandemic the markets we serve may experience increased volatility and may not experience the seasonality or cyclicality that we expect any decline in our customers markets would likely result in a reduction in demand for our solutions and services the current impact of covid19 on the supply chain globally could impact our markets and harm our business also if our customers markets decline we may not be able to collect on outstanding amounts due to us such declines could harm our financial position results of operations cash flows and stock price and could limit our profitability also in such an environment pricing pressures could intensify since a significant portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed in nature due to sales rd and manufacturing costs if we were unable to respond quickly enough these pricing pressures could further reduce our operating margins 

economic and political policies favoring national interests could adversely affect our results of operations 

nationalistic economic policies and political trends in the united states the united kingdom the european union singapore malaysia and china among other countries such as opposition to globalization and free trade sanctions or trade restrictions withdrawal from or renegotiation of global trade agreements tax policies that favor domestic industries and interests the distancing or potential exit of other countries from the european union and other similar actions may result in increased transaction costs reduced ability to hire employees reduced access to supplies and materials reduced demand or access to customers in international markets and inability to conduct our operations as they have been conducted historically each of these factors may adversely affect our business 

international trade disputes and increased tariffs between the united states and such jurisdictions could substantially change our expectations and ability to operate in such jurisdictions as we have done historically many of our suppliers vendors customers partners and other entities with whom we do business have strong ties to doing business in china their ability to supply materials to us buy products or services from us or otherwise work with us is affected by their ability to do business in china if the us’s relationship with china results in additional trade disputes trade protection measures retaliatory actions tariffs and increased barriers policies that favor domestic industries or increased import or export licensing requirements or restrictions then our deployment of resources in jurisdictions affected by such measures could be misaligned and our operations may be adversely affected due to such changes in the economic and political ecosystem in which our suppliers vendors customers partners and other entities with whom we do business operate 

a decreased demand for our customers’ products or trade restrictions could adversely affect our results of operations 

our business depends on our customers’ ability to manufacture design and sell their products in the marketplace international trade disputes affecting our customers could adversely affect our business tariffs on imports to or from china could increase the cost of our customers’ components and raw materials which could make our customers’ products and services more expensive and could reduce demand for our customers’ products protectionist and retaliatory trade measures by either china or the united states could limit our customers’ ability to sell their products and services and could reduce demand for our customers’ products our customers and other entities in our customer chain could decide to take actions in response to international trade disputes that we could not foresee a decrease in demand or significant change in operations from our customers due to international trade disputes could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

in addition to the above our customers and suppliers could become subject to us export restrictions and sanctions such as being added to the us department of commerce’s “lists of parties of concern” and having us export privileges denied or suspended in the event that a customer or supplier of ours becomes subject to such sanctions we will suspend our business with such customer or supplier because of the continued tense political and economic relationship between the united states and china new sanctions could be imposed with little notice which could leave us without an adequate alternative solution to compensate for our inability to continue to do business with such customer or supplier some of our suppliers and customers in the supply chain are working on unique solutions and products in the market and it may be difficult if not impossible to replace them especially with short notice we cannot predict what impact future sanctions could have on our customers or suppliers and therefore our business any export restrictions or sanctions and any tariffs or other trade restriction imposed on our customers or suppliers could adversely affect our financial condition and business 

economic political and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our results of operations 

because we sell our solutions worldwide our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally we anticipate that revenue from international operations will continue to represent a majority of our total revenue however there can be no assurances that our international sales will continue at existing levels or grow in accordance with our effort to 

  

increase foreign market penetration in addition many of our employees contract manufacturers suppliers and manufacturing facilities are located outside the united states accordingly our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors including but not limited to 

• negative impact of a country’s response to the global covid19 pandemic or an imposed reduction in economic activity and other economic and political measures taken to contain the spread of covid19 

• changes in a specific countrys or regions political economic or other conditions including but not limited to changes that favor national interests and economic volatility 

• negative consequences from changes in tax laws 

• difficulty in protecting intellectual property 

• existing interruptions to transportation flows for delivery of parts to us and finished goods to our customers 

• changes in foreign currency exchange rates 

• difficulty in staffing and managing foreign operations 

• local competition 

• differing labor regulations 

• unexpected changes in regulatory requirements 

• inadequate local infrastructure 

• potential incidences of corruption and fraudulent business practices and 

• volatile geopolitical turmoil including popular uprisings regional conflicts terrorism and war 

we centralize most of our accounting processes at two locations india and malaysia these processes include general accounting inventory cost accounting accounts payable and accounts receivables functions if conditions change in those countries it may adversely affect operations including impairing our ability to pay our suppliers our results of operations as well as our liquidity may be adversely affected and possible delays may occur in reporting financial results 

further even if we are able to successfully manage the risks of international operations our business may be adversely affected if our business partners are not able to successfully manage similar risks 

failure to introduce successful new solutions and services in a timely manner to address increased competition rapid technological changes and changing industry standards could result in our solutions and services becoming obsolete 

we generally sell our solutions in industries that are characterized by increased competition through frequent new solution and service introductions rapid technological changes and changing industry standards in addition many of the markets in which we operate are seasonal and cyclical without the timely introduction of new solutions services and enhancements our solutions and services will become technologically obsolete over time in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer our ability to offer new solutions and services and to deploy them in a timely manner depend on several factors including but not limited to our ability to 

• properly identify customer needs 

• innovate and develop new technologies services and applications 

• successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner 

• manufacture and deliver our solutions in sufficient volumes and on time 

• differentiate our offerings from our competitors offerings 

• price our solutions competitively 

• anticipate our competitors development of new solutions services or technological innovations and 

• control product quality in our manufacturing process 

the continuing covid19 global pandemic could impact our ability to execute on these dependencies it may be difficult to differentiate ourselves from our competitors due to limited travel and access to customers which could make it difficult to properly assess customer needs and interruptions in manufacturing and delivery of solutions 

  

our future operating results may fluctuate significantly if our investments in innovative technologies are not as profitable as we anticipate 

on a regular basis we review the existing technologies available in the market and identify strategic new technologies to develop and invest in we are currently devoting significant resources to new technologies in the communications automotive battery internet of things and mobile industries we are investing in rd developing relationships with customers and suppliers and redirecting our corporate and operational resources to grow within these innovative technologies our income could be harmed if we fail to gain sufficient market share if demand for our solutions is lower than we expect or if our income related to the innovative technologies is lower than we anticipate we provide solutions for the design development and manufacturing stages of our customers’ workflow our customers who currently use our solutions in one stage of their workflow may not use our solutions in other aspects of their manufacturing process 

failure to adjust our purchases due to changing market conditions or failure to estimate our customers demand could adversely affect our income 

our income could be harmed if we are unable to adjust our purchases to market fluctuations including those caused by the seasonal or cyclical nature of the markets in which we operate the sale of our solutions and services are dependent to a large degree on customers whose industries are subject to seasonal or cyclical trends in the demand for their products for example the consumer electronics market is particularly volatile making demand difficult to anticipate making such estimations in the current economic climate affected by the global pandemic is particularly difficult as increased volatility may impact seasonal trends making it more difficult to anticipate demand fluctuations additionally the current disruption to the global supply chain has impacted our ability to purchase supplies and components to meet increasing product demand which could materially affect our results we have seen a shortage of parts for some of our products in addition some of the parts that require custom design are not readily available from alternate suppliers due to their unique design or the length of time necessary for design work should a supplier cease manufacturing such a component we would be forced to reengineer our solution in addition to discontinuing parts suppliers may also extend lead times limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors the covid19 pandemic has further exacerbated these risks as suppliers are impacted by periodic surges in infection rates possible shutdown orders new safety restrictions including government and customer vaccine mandates and disruptions to the global supply chain in order to secure components for the production of products we may continue to enter into noncancellable purchase commitments with vendors or at times make advance payments to suppliers which could impact our ability to adjust our inventory to declining market demands prior commitments of this type have resulted in an excess of parts when demand for electronic products has decreased if demand for our solutions is less than we expect we may experience additional excess and obsolete inventories and be forced to incur additional charges 

dependence on contract manufacturing and outsourcing other portions of our supply chain may adversely affect our ability to bring solutions to market and damage our reputation dependence on outsourced information technology and other administrative functions may impair our ability to operate effectively 

as part of our efforts to streamline operations and to cut costs we outsource aspects of our manufacturing processes and other functions and continue to evaluate additional outsourcing if our contract manufacturers or other outsourcers fail to perform their obligations in a timely manner or at satisfactory quality levels our ability to bring solutions to market and our reputation could suffer for example during a market upturn our contract manufacturers may be unable to meet our demand requirements which may preclude us from fulfilling our customers orders on a timely basis the ability of these manufacturers to perform is largely outside of our control additionally changing or replacing our contract manufacturers or other outsourced vendors could cause disruptions or delays in addition we outsource significant portions of our information technology it and other administrative functions since it is critical to our operations any failure of our it providers to perform could impair our ability to operate effectively in addition to the risks outlined above problems with manufacturing or it outsourcing could result in lower revenues and unrealized efficiencies and could impact our results of operations and stock price much of our outsourcing takes place in developing countries and as a result may be subject to geopolitical uncertainty 

our operating results may suffer if our manufacturing capacity does not match the demand for our solutions 

because we cannot immediately adapt our production capacity and related cost structures to rapidly changing market conditions when demand is lower than our expectations our manufacturing capacity will likely exceed our production requirements during a general market upturn or an upturn in our business if we cannot increase our manufacturing capacity to meet product demand we will not be able to fulfill orders in a timely manner which could lead to order cancellations contract breaches or indemnification obligations this inability could materially and adversely limit our ability to improve our income margin and operating results by contrast if during an economic downturn we had excess manufacturing capacity then our fixed costs associated with excess manufacturing capacity would adversely affect our income margins and operating results 

  

key customers or large orders may expose us to additional business and legal risks that could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition  

as a global company we have key customers all over the world although no one customer makes up more than 10 percent of our revenue sales to those customers could be reduced or eliminated as a result of failure to respond to customer needs reduced customer demand increased sales to our competitors inability to manufacture or ship products and solutions supply chain constraints trade restrictions sanctions and embargoes we have experienced forced reductions in sales and been prevented from selling large orders to certain key customers due to trade restrictions which we have been able to mitigate with the addition of new customers and new business if we have future reductions in sales or lose key customers there is no guarantee that we will be able to mitigate the impact of such reductions or losses which could negatively impact our income operating results and financial condition 

certain key customers have substantial purchasing power and leverage in negotiating contractual arrangements with us these customers may demand contract terms that differ considerably from our standard terms and conditions large orders may also include severe contractual liabilities if we fail to provide the quantity and quality of product at the required delivery times or fail to meet other obligations while we attempt to contractually limit our potential liability we may agree to some or all of these provisions to secure these orders and grow our business such actions expose us to significant additional risks which could result in a material adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition 

industry consolidation and consolidation among our customer base may lead to increased competition and may harm our operating results 

there is potential for industry consolidation in our markets as companies attempt to strengthen or hold their market positions in an evolving industry companies could be acquired or may be unable to continue operations companies that are strategic alliance partners in some areas of our business may acquire or form alliances with our competitors thereby reducing their business with us we believe that industry consolidation may result in stronger competitors and could lead to more variability in our operating results and could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition furthermore particularly in the communications market rapid consolidation would lead to fewer customers with the effect that loss of a major customer could have a material impact on results not anticipated in a customer marketplace composed of more numerous participants 

additionally if there is consolidation among our customer base our customers may be able to command increased leverage in negotiating prices and other terms of sale which could adversely affect our profitability in addition if as a result of increased leverage customer pressures require us to reduce our pricing such that our gross margins are diminished we could decide not to sell our solutions under such less favorable terms which would decrease our revenue consolidation among our customer base may also lead to reduced demand for our solutions replacement of our products by the combined entity with those of our competitors and cancellations of orders each of which could harm our operating results 

our acquisitions strategic alliances joint ventures internal reorganizations and divestitures may result in financial results that are different than expected 

in the normal course of business we may engage in discussions with third parties relating to possible acquisitions strategic alliances joint ventures and divestitures additionally we occasionally make changes to our internal structure to align business products services and solutions with market demands and to obtain cost synergies and operational efficiencies as a result of such transactions our financial results may differ from our own or the investment communitys expectations in a given fiscal quarter or over the long term if market conditions or other factors lead us to change our strategic direction we may not realize the expected value from such transactions or reorganizations further such thirdparty transactions often have postclosing arrangements including but not limited to postclosing adjustments transition services escrows or indemnifications the financial results of which can be difficult to predict in addition acquisitions and strategic alliances may require us to integrate a different company culture management team employees and business infrastructure into our existing operations without impacting the business operations of the newly acquired company we may have difficulty developing manufacturing and marketing the products of a newly acquired company in a way that enhances performance and expands the markets of the newly acquired company the acquired company may not enhance the performance of our businesses or product lines such that we do not realize the value from expected synergies depending on the size and complexity of an acquisition the successful integration of the entity depends on a variety of factors including but not limited to 

• the achievement of anticipated cost savings synergies business opportunities and growth prospects from combining the acquired company 

• the scalability of production manufacturing and marketing of products of a newly acquired company to broader adjacent markets 

• the ability to cohesively integrate operations product definitions price lists delivery and technical support for products and solutions of a newly acquired company into our existing operations 

  

• the compatibility of our infrastructure operations policies and organizations with those of the acquired company 

• the retention of key employees andor customers 

• the management of facilities and employees in different geographic areas and 

• the management of relationships with our strategic partners suppliers and customer base 

if we do not realize the expected benefits or synergies of such transactions our consolidated financial position results of operations cash flows and stock price could be negatively impacted additionally we may record significant goodwill and other assets as a result of acquisitions or investments and we may be required to incur impairment charges which could adversely affect our consolidated financial position and results of operations 

any inability to complete acquisitions on acceptable terms could negatively impact our growth rate and financial performance 

our ability to grow revenues earnings and cash flow depends in part upon our ability to identify and successfully acquire and integrate businesses at appropriate prices and realize anticipated synergies and business performance appropriate targets for acquisition are difficult to identify and complete for a variety of reasons including but not limited to limited due diligence high valuations business and intellectual property evaluations other interested parties negotiations of the definitive documentation satisfaction of closing conditions the need to obtain antitrust or other regulatory approvals on acceptable terms and availability of funding the inability to close appropriate acquisitions on acceptable terms could adversely impact our growth rate revenue and financial performance 

we may need additional financing in the future to meet our capital needs or to make opportunistic acquisitions and such financing may not be available on terms favorable to us if at all and may be dilutive to existing shareholders 

we may need to seek additional financing for our general corporate purposes for example we may need to increase our investment in rd activities or need funds to make acquisitions we may be unable to obtain any desired additional financing on terms favorable to us if at all if adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms we may be unable to fund our expansion successfully develop or enhance solutions or respond to competitive pressures any of which could negatively affect our business if we finance acquisitions by issuing additional convertible debt or equity securities our existing stockholders may experience share dilution which could affect the market price of our stock if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity securities our shareholders will experience dilution of their ownership interest if we raise additional funds by issuing debt we may be subject to further limitations on our operations and ability to pay dividends due to restrictive covenants 

we have outstanding debt and may incur other debt in the future which could adversely affect our financial condition liquidity and results of operations 

we currently have outstanding debt as well as availability to borrow under a revolving credit facility we may borrow additional amounts in the future and use the proceeds from any future borrowing for general corporate purposes future acquisitions expansion of our business or repurchases of our outstanding shares of common stock 

our incurrence of this debt and increases in our aggregate levels of debt may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition by among other things 

• requiring a portion of our cash flow from operations to make interest payments on this debt 

• increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions 

• reducing the cash flow available to fund capital expenditures and other corporate purposes and to grow our business and 

• limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the industry 

our current revolving credit facility and term loan imposes restrictions on us including restrictions on our ability to create liens on our assets and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur indebtedness and requires us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios our ability to comply with these ratios may be affected by events beyond our control in addition the indenture governing our senior notes contains covenants that may adversely affect our ability to incur certain liens if we breach any of the covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders then subject to applicable cure periods our outstanding indebtedness could be declared immediately due and payable 

if currency exchange rates fluctuate substantially in the future our financial results could be adversely affected 

a substantial amount of our solutions are priced and paid for in us dollars although many of our solutions are priced in local currencies and a significant amount of certain types of expenses such as payroll utilities tax and marketing expenses are paid in local currencies our hedging programs are designed to reduce but not entirely eliminate within any given 12 

  

month period the impact of currency exchange rate movements including those caused by currency controls which could impact our business operating results and financial condition by resulting in lower revenue or increased expenses however for expenses beyond a 12month period our hedging strategy will not mitigate our exchange rate risk in addition our currency hedging programs involve thirdparty financial institutions as counterparties the weakening or failure of these counterparties may adversely affect our hedging programs and our financial condition through among other things a reduction in the number of available counterparties increasingly unfavorable terms or the failure of counterparties to perform under hedging contracts 

volatile changes in weather conditions and effects of climate change could damage or destroy strategic facilities including our headquarters which could have a significant negative impact on our operations 

we and our customers and suppliers are vulnerable to the increasing impact of climate change volatile changes in weather conditions including extreme heat or cold could increase the risk of wildfires floods blizzards hurricanes and other weatherrelated disasters such extreme weather events can cause power outages and network disruptions that may result in disruption to operations and may impact our ability to manufacture and ship product which may negatively impact revenue disasters created by extreme conditions could cause significant damage to or destruction of our facilities resulting in temporary or longterm closures of our facilities and operations and significant expense for repair or replacement of damaged or destroyed facilities this could also result in loss or damage to employee homes employees relocating to other parts of the country or being unwilling to relocate to the strategic locations housing shortages and loss of or inability to recruit key employees this could result in adverse impact to the available workforce damage to or destruction of inventory inability to manufacture and deliver solutions cancellation of orders and breaches of customer contracts leading to reduced revenue 

if we suffer a loss to our employees factories facilities or distribution system due to a catastrophic event our operations could be significantly harmed 

our factories facilities and distribution system are vulnerable to catastrophic loss due to natural or manmade disasters several of our facilities could be subject to a catastrophic loss caused by earthquake or other natural disasters due to their locations for example our production facilities headquarters and laboratories in california and our production facilities in japan are all located in areas with aboveaverage seismic activity if any of these facilities were to experience a catastrophic loss it could disrupt our operations delay production shipments and revenue and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility in addition since we have consolidated our manufacturing facilities we are more likely to experience an interruption to our operations in the event of a catastrophe in any one location although we carry insurance for property damage and business interruption we do not carry insurance or financial reserves for interruptions or potential losses arising from earthquakes or terrorism also our thirdparty insurance coverage will vary from time to time in both type and amount depending on availability cost and our decisions with respect to risk retention economic conditions and uncertainties in global markets may adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain thirdparty insurance if our thirdparty insurance coverage is adversely affected or to the extent we have elected to selfinsure we may be at a greater risk that our operations will be harmed by a catastrophic loss 

our commitment to net zero emissions in company operations by fiscal year 2040 will be subject to significant costs and regulations which could impact business operations processes revenue and reputation 

in may 2021 the company disclosed its commitment to achieving net zero scope 1 and scope 2 emissions by the end of fiscal year 2040 the company plans to meet this commitment by reducing energy consumption through efficiency and conservation measures investments in renewable energy and selective purchase of certified offsets for residual emissions the company also committed in september 2021 to developing approved sciencebased targets in line with limiting global warming to 15 degrees celsius above preindustrial levels in addition to scope 1 and scope 2 emissions defined by our net zero goal the company will develop scope 3 reduction and engagement targets across relevant categories as part of our commitment to sciencebased targets the development and implementation of goals and targets may require significant and expensive capital improvements changes in product development manufacturing processes and shipping methods these changes may materially increase the cost to manufacture and ship products and solutions result in price increases to customers reduce product or solution performance and create customer dissatisfaction potentially adversely impacting our revenue and profitability 

achieving net zero emissions goals and targets may entail compliance with evolving laws and regulatory requirements which may cause us to change or reconfigure facilities and operations to meet regulatory standards if operations are out of compliance we may be subject to civil or criminal actions fines and penalties and be required to make significant changes to facilities and operations and temporarily or permanently shut down noncompliant operations which could result in business disruption and significant unexpected expense delays in or inability to develop manufacture and ship products and solutions customer dissatisfaction loss of revenue and damage to our reputation 

if we are unable to sufficiently reduce scope 1 and scope 2 emissions through energy reduction measures or our investments in renewable energy are not successful we may fail to achieve our net zero emission commitment by fiscal year 2040 if we are unable to achieve scope 3 reduction and engagement targets we may fail to achieve our commitment to sciencebased targets failing to achieve the company’s net zero or sciencebased targets commitments could result in 

  

regulatory noncompliance criminal or civil actions against us assessment of fees and penalties inability to develop manufacture and ship products customer dissatisfaction with our products and solutions reduced revenue and profitability shareholder lawsuits and damage to our reputation 

third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property rights and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling solutions or services 

from time to time third parties have claimed that one or more of our solutions or services infringe their intellectual property rights we analyze and take action in response to such claims on a casebycase basis any dispute or litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and timeconsuming due to the complexity of our technology and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation and could divert our management and key personnel from business operations a claim of intellectual property infringement could cause us to enter into a costly or restrictive license agreement which may not be available under acceptable terms or at all require us to redesign certain of our solutions which would be costly and timeconsuming andor subject us to significant damages or an injunction against the development and sale of certain solutions or services in certain of our businesses we rely on thirdparty intellectual property licenses and we cannot ensure that these licenses will be available to us in the future on terms favorable to us or at all 

third parties may infringe our intellectual property rights and we may suffer competitive injury or expend significant resources enforcing our intellectual property rights 

our success depends in part on our proprietary technology including technology we obtained through acquisitions we rely on various intellectual property rights including patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets as well as confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish our proprietary rights if we do not enforce our intellectual property rights successfully our competitive position may suffer which could harm our operating results 

our pending patent copyright and trademark registration applications may not be allowed or competitors may challenge the validity or scope of our patents copyrights or trademarks in addition our patents copyrights trademarks and other intellectual property rights may not provide us with a significant competitive advantage in preparation for the separation and distribution we applied for trademarks related to our global brand name in various jurisdictions worldwide any successful opposition to our applications in material jurisdictions could impose material costs on us or make it more difficult to protect our brand different jurisdictions vary widely in the level of protection and priority they give to trademark and other intellectual property rights 

we may be required to spend significant resources monitoring our intellectual property rights and we may or may not be able to detect infringement of such rights by third parties our competitive position may be harmed if we cannot detect infringement and enforce our intellectual property rights in a timely manner or at all in some circumstances we may choose to not pursue enforcement due to a variety of reasons in addition competitors may avoid infringement by designing around our intellectual property rights or by developing noninfringing competing technologies intellectual property rights and our ability to enforce them may be unavailable or limited in some countries which could make it easier for competitors to capture market share and could result in lost revenues to the company furthermore some of our intellectual property is licensed to others which allows them to compete with us using that intellectual property 

if we experience a significant cybersecurity attack or disruption in our it systems our business reputation and operating results could be adversely affected 

we rely on several centralized it systems to provide solutions and services maintain financial records retain sensitive data such as intellectual property proprietary business information and data related to customers suppliers and business partners process orders manage inventory process shipments to customers and operate other critical functions the ongoing maintenance and security of this information is pertinent to the success of our business operations and our strategic goals 

despite our implementation of network security measures our network may be vulnerable to cybersecurity attacks computer viruses breakins and similar disruptions our network security measures include but are not limited to the implementation of firewalls antivirus protection patches log monitors routine backups offsite storage network audits and routine updates and modifications despite our efforts to create these security barriers we may not be able to keep pace as new threats emerge and it is virtually impossible for us to entirely eliminate this risk cybersecurity attacks are evolving and include but are not limited to malicious software attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation operating results and financial condition and no assurance can be given that our efforts to reduce the risk of such attacks will be successful 

in addition our it systems may be susceptible to damage disruptions instability or shutdowns due to power outages hardware failures telecommunication failures user errors implementation of new operational systems or software or upgrades to existing systems and software catastrophes or other unforeseen events such events could result in the disruption of business processes network degradation and system downtime along with the potential that a third party will exploit our critical assets 

  

such as intellectual property proprietary business information and data related to our customers suppliers and business partners further such events could result in loss of revenue loss of or reduction in purchase orders inability to report financial information litigation regulatory fines and penalties and other damage that could have a material impact on our business operations to the extent that such disruptions occur our customers and partners may lose confidence in our solutions and we may lose business or brand reputation resulting in a material and adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

we are or will be subject to ongoing tax examinations of our tax returns by the irs and other tax authorities an adverse outcome of any such audit or examination by the irs or other tax authority could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

we are or will be subject to ongoing tax examinations of our tax returns by the irs and other tax authorities in various jurisdictions we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from ongoing tax examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes these assessments can require considerable estimates and judgments intercompany transactions associated with the sale of inventory services intellectual property and cost sharing arrangements are complex and affect our tax liabilities the calculation of our tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in multiple jurisdictions the outcomes of these tax examinations could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition due to the complexity of tax contingencies the ultimate resolution of any tax matters related to operations may result in payments greater or less than amounts accrued 

our operations may be adversely impacted by changes in our business mix or changes in the tax legislative landscape 

our effective tax rate may be adversely impacted by among other things changes in the mix of our earnings among countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets and changes in tax laws we cannot give any assurance as to what our effective tax rate will be in the future because among other things there is uncertainty regarding the tax policies of the jurisdictions where we operate changes in tax laws such as tax reform in the united states or changes in tax laws resulting from the organization for economic cooperation and development’s “oecd” multijurisdictional plan of action to address “base erosion and profit shifting” and the taxation of the “digital economy” could impact our effective tax rate 

if tax laws or incentives change or cease to be in effect our income taxes could increase significantly 

we are subject to federal state and local taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions we devote significant resources to evaluating our tax positions and our worldwide provision for taxes our financial results and tax treatment are susceptible to changes in tax accounting and other laws regulations principles and interpretations in the united states and in other jurisdictions where we do business with the existence of economic and political policies that favor domestic interests it is possible that more countries will enact tax laws that either increase the tax rates or reduce or change the tax incentives available to multinational companies like ours upon a change in tax laws in any territory where we do significant business we may not be able to maintain our current tax rate or qualify for or maintain the benefits of any tax incentives offered to the extent such incentives are offered 

we currently benefit from tax incentives extended to certain of our foreign subsidiaries to encourage investment or employment the most significant of which being singapore the singapore tax incentives require that specific conditions be satisfied which include achieving thresholds of employment ownership of certain assets as well as specific types of investment activities within singapore based on the current tax environment we believe that we will satisfy such conditions in the future as needed but cannot guarantee that the tax environment will not change or that such conditions will be satisfied 

our singapore tax incentives are due for renewal in fiscal 2024 but we cannot guarantee that singapore will not revoke the tax incentives earlier our taxes could increase if the existing singapore incentives are revoked or are not renewed upon expiration we cannot guarantee that we will qualify for any new incentive regime that may exist in fiscal 2024 if we cannot or do not wish to satisfy all or portions of the tax incentives conditions we may lose the related tax incentives and could be required to refund the benefits that the tax incentives previously provided as a result our effective tax rate could be higher than it would have been had we maintained the benefits of the tax incentives and could harm our operating results after tax 

our business will suffer if we are not able to retain and hire key personnel 

our future success depends partly on the continued service of our key research engineering sales marketing manufacturing executive and administrative personnel including personnel joining our company through acquisitions the markets in which we operate are dynamic and we may need to respond with reorganizations workforce reductions and site closures from time to time we believe our pay levels are competitive within the regions that we operate however there is also intense competition for certain highly technical specialties in geographic areas in which we operate and it may become more difficult to retain key employees if we fail to retain and hire a sufficient number of these personnel we may not be able to meet key objectives such as launching effective product innovations and meeting financial goals and maintain or expand our business 

  

if we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with certain regulations we may be subject to substantial negative financial consequences and civil or criminal penalties 

we and our customers are subject to various significant international federal state and local regulations including but not limited to health and safety including regulations related to covid19 packaging data privacy product content environmental labor and importexport regulations these regulations are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time we have been required to incur significant expenses to comply with these regulations and to remedy violations of certain importexport regulations any future failure by us to comply with applicable government regulations could also result in cessation of our operations or portions of our operations high financial penalties product recalls or impositions of fines and restrictions on our ability to carry on or expand our operations if demand for our solutions is adversely affected or our costs increase our business would suffer 

our rd manufacturing and distribution operations involve the use of hazardous substances and are regulated under international federal state and local laws governing health and safety and the environment we are also regulated under a number of international federal state and local laws regarding recycling product packaging and product content requirements we apply strict standards for protection of the environment and occupational health and safety inside and outside the united states even where not subject to regulation imposed by foreign governments we believe that our properties and operations at our facilities comply in all material respects with applicable environmental and occupational health and safety laws in spite of these efforts no assurance can be given that we will be compliant with all applicable environmental and workplace health and safety laws and regulations and violations could result in civil or criminal sanctions fines and penalties 

we have developed internal data handling policies and practices to comply with the general data protection regulation “gdpr” in the european union and data privacy regulations similar to gdpr in other jurisdictions our existing business strategy does not rely on aggregating or selling personally identifiable information and as a general matter keysight does not process personally identifiable information on behalf of our customers we devote resources to keep up with the changing regulatory environment on data privacy in the jurisdictions where we do business despite our efforts no assurance can be given that we will be compliant with data privacy regulations new laws amendments or interpretations of regulations industry standards and contractual obligations relating to data privacy may require us to incur additional costs and restrict our business operations if we fail to comply with gdpr or other data privacy regulation we may be subject to significant financial fines and civil or criminal penalties and may suffer damage to our reputation or brand which could adversely affect our business and financial results 

in addition our products and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies like the international standards organization as well as regulation by other agencies such as the us federal communications commission we also must comply with work safety rules if we fail to adequately address any of these regulations our businesses could be harmed 

failure to comply with anticorruption laws could adversely affect our business and result in financial penalties 

because we have extensive international operations we must comply with complex foreign and us laws and regulations such as the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials and anticompetition regulations although we actively maintain policies and procedures designed to ensure ongoing compliance with these laws and regulations there can be no assurance that our employees contractors or agents will not violate these policies and procedures violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties criminal sanctions restrictions on our business conduct and on our ability to offer our solutions in one or more countries and could also materially affect our brand ability to attract and retain employees international operations business and operating results 

our business and financial results may be adversely affected by various legal and regulatory proceedings 

we are subject to legal proceedings lawsuits and other claims in the normal course of business and could become subject to additional claims in the future some of which could be material the outcome of existing proceedings lawsuits and claims may differ from our expectations because the outcomes of litigation are often difficult to reliably predict various factors or developments can lead us to change current estimates of liabilities and related insurance receivables where applicable or permit us to make such estimates for matters previously not susceptible to reasonable estimates such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment a significant settlement significant regulatory developments or changes in applicable law a future adverse ruling settlement or unfavorable development could result in charges that could adversely affect our business operating results or financial condition 

our internal controls may be determined to be ineffective which may adversely affect investor confidence in our company the value of our stock and our access to capital 

the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 requires us to furnish a report by management on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting among other things we are devoting significant resources and time to comply with such 

  

internal control over financial reporting requirements however we cannot be certain that these measures will ensure that we design implement and maintain adequate control over our financial processes and reporting in the future especially in the context of acquisitions of other businesses any difficulties in the assimilation of acquired businesses into our control system could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations inferior internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our stock or on our access to capital or cause us to be subject to investigation or sanctions by the sec 

adverse conditions in the global banking industry and credit markets may adversely impact the value of our cash investments or impair our liquidity 

our cash and cash equivalents are invested or held in a mix of money market funds time deposit accounts and bank demand deposit accounts disruptions in the financial markets may in some cases result in an inability to access assets such as money market funds that traditionally have been viewed as highly liquid any failure of our counterparty financial institutions or funds in which we have invested may adversely impact our cash and cash equivalent positions and in turn our results and financial condition 

future investment returns on pension assets may be lower than expected or interest rates may decline requiring us to make significant additional cash contributions to our future plans 

we sponsor several defined benefit pension plans that cover many of our salaried and hourly employees the federal pension protection act of 2006 requires that certain capitalization levels be maintained in each of the us plans and there may be similar funding requirements in the plans outside the united states because it is unknown what the investment return on and the fair value of our pension assets will be in future years or what interest rates and discount rates may be at any point in time no assurances can be given that applicable law will not require us to make future material plan contributions any such contributions could adversely affect our financial condition 

environmental contamination from past operations could subject us to unreimbursed costs and could harm onsite operations and the future use and value of the properties involved and environmental contamination caused by ongoing operations could subject us to substantial liabilities in the future 

some of our properties are undergoing remediation by hp inc hp for subsurface contaminations that were known at the time of agilents separation from hp in 1999 in connection with agilents separation from hp hp and agilent entered into an agreement pursuant to which hp agreed to retain the liability for this subsurface contamination perform the required remediation and indemnify agilent with respect to claims arising out of that contamination agilent has assigned its rights and obligations under this agreement to keysight in respect of facilities transferred to us in the separation as a result hp will have access to a limited number of our properties to perform remediation although hp agreed to minimize interference with onsite operations at such properties remediation activities and subsurface contamination may require us to incur unreimbursed costs and could harm onsite operations and the future use and value of the properties in connection with the separation agilent will indemnify us directly for any liabilities related thereto we cannot be sure that hp will continue to fulfill its remediation obligations or that agilent will continue to fulfill its indemnification obligations 

in connection with the separation from agilent agilent also agreed to indemnify us for any liability associated with contamination from past operations at all properties transferred from agilent to keysight we cannot be sure that agilent will fulfill its indemnification obligations 

our current manufacturing processes involve the use of substances regulated under various international federal state and local laws governing the environment as a result we may become subject to liabilities for environmental contamination and these liabilities may be substantial although our policy is to apply strict standards for environmental protection at our sites inside and outside the united states even if the sites outside the united states are not subject to regulations imposed by foreign governments we may not be aware of all conditions that could subject us to liability 

risks related to our common stock 

our share price may fluctuate significantly 

our common stock is listed on the new york stock exchange nyse under the ticker symbol “keys” the market price of our common stock may fluctuate widely depending on many factors some of which may be beyond our control including but not limited to 

• actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results due to factors related to our business 

• success or failure of our business strategy 

• our quarterly or annual earnings or those of other companies in our industry 

• our ability to obtain thirdparty financing as needed 

  

• announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions or dispositions 

• changes in accounting standards policies guidance interpretations or principles 

• the failure of securities analysts to cover our common stock 

• changes in earnings estimates by securities analysts or our ability to meet those estimates 

• the operating and share price performance of other comparable companies 

• investor perception of our company 

• natural or other disasters that investors believe may affect us 

• the impact of global pandemics such as covid19 

• overall market fluctuations 

• results from any material litigation or government investigations 

• changes in laws or regulations affecting our business and 

• general economic conditions and other external factors 

stock markets in general have experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company these broad market fluctuations could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 

in addition when the market price of a company’s shares drops significantly shareholders often institute securities class action lawsuits against the company a lawsuit against us could cause us to incur substantial costs and could divert the time and attention of management and other resources 

we do not currently pay dividends on our common stock 

we do not currently pay dividends on our common stock the payment of any dividends in the future and the timing and amount thereof to our stockholders fall within the discretion of our board of directors the boards decisions regarding the payment of dividends will depend on many factors such as our financial condition earnings capital requirements debt service obligations restrictive covenants in our debt industry practice legal requirements regulatory constraints and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant we cannot guarantee that we will pay a dividend in the future or continue to pay any dividends if we commence paying dividends 

certain provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and of delaware law may prevent or delay an acquisition of the company which could decrease the trading price of our common stock 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain and delaware law contains provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by making such practices or bids unacceptably expensive to the bidder and to encourage prospective acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover these provisions include but are not limited to 

• the inability of our shareholders to call a special meeting 

• the inability of our shareholders to act without a meeting of shareholders 

• rules regarding how shareholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at shareholder meetings 

• the right of our board of directors to issue preferred stock without shareholder approval 

• the division of our board of directors into three classes of directors with each class serving a staggered threeyear term and this classified board provision could have the effect of making the replacement of incumbent directors more time consuming and difficult 

• a provision that shareholders may only remove directors with cause 

• the ability of our directors and not shareholders to fill vacancies on our board of directors and 

• the requirement that the affirmative vote of shareholders holding at least 80 percent of our voting stock is required to amend certain provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation relating to the number term and removal of our directors the filling of our board vacancies the advance notice to be given for nominations for elections of directors the calling of special meetings of shareholders shareholder action by written consent the ability of the board of directors to amend the bylaws elimination of liability of directors to the extent permitted by delaware law exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our shareholders and amendments of the certificate of incorporation and certain provisions in our amended and restated bylaws relating to 

  

the calling of special meetings of shareholders the business that may be conducted or considered at annual or special meetings the advance notice of shareholder business and nominations shareholder action by written consent the number tenure qualifications and removal of our directors the filling of our board vacancies director and officer indemnification and amendments of the bylaws 

in addition because we have not chosen to be exempt from section 203 of the delaware general corporation law the dgcl this provision could also delay or prevent a change of control that some shareholders may favor section 203 provides that subject to limited exceptions persons that acquire or are affiliated with a person that acquires more than 15 percent of the outstanding voting stock of a delaware corporation an interested stockholder shall not engage in any business combination with that corporation including by merger consolidation or acquisitions of additional shares for a threeyear period following the date on which the person became an interested stockholder unless i prior to such time the board of directors of such corporation approved either the business combination or the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder ii upon consummation of the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder the interested stockholder owned at least 85 percent of the voting stock of such corporation at the time the transaction commenced excluding for purposes of determining the voting stock outstanding but not the outstanding voting stock owned by the interested stockholder the voting stock owned by directors who are also officers or held in employee benefit plans in which the employees do not have a confidential right to tender or vote stock held by the plan or iii on or subsequent to such time the business combination is approved by the board of directors of such corporation and authorized at a meeting of shareholders by the affirmative vote of at least twothirds of the outstanding voting stock of such corporation not owned by the interested stockholder 

we believe these provisions will protect our shareholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors and by providing our board of directors with more time to assess any acquisition proposal these provisions are not intended to make us immune from takeovers however these provisions will apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some shareholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that our board of directors determines is not in the best interests of the company and our shareholders these provisions may also prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates that the state courts in the state of delaware or if no state court located within the state of delaware has jurisdiction the federal court for the district of delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our shareholders which could discourage lawsuits against the company and our directors and officers 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provide that unless the board of directors otherwise determines the state courts in the state of delaware or if no state court located within the state of delaware has jurisdiction the federal court for the district of delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors or officers to the company or our shareholders any action asserting a claim against us or any of our directors or officers arising pursuant to any provision of the dgcl or keysights amended and restated certificate of incorporation or bylaws or any action asserting a claim against us or any of our directors or officers governed by the internal affairs doctrine this exclusive forum provision may limit the ability of our shareholders to bring a claim in a judicial forum that such shareholders find favorable for disputes with us or our directors or officers which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors and officers

covid19 pandemic and related supply chain disruptions 

our global operations have been and continue to be affected by the ongoing global pandemic of covid19 and the resulting volatility and uncertainty it has caused in the us and international markets during the year ended october 31 2021 governments in many countries including the united states continued to issue orders and recommendations to attempt to reduce the further spread of the disease such orders included movement control and shelterinplace orders travel restrictions limitations on public gatherings school closures social distancing requirements vaccine mandates and the closure of all but critical and essential services and infrastructure working with local governments and health officials to implement health and safety measures at all of our locations we have reopened most sites worldwide and significantly ramped our production and services operations plans to return all employees to keysight facilities at precovid19 levels were temporarily delayed by the emergence of the delta variant the pandemic has led to global supply chain challenges that have adversely impacted our ability to procure certain components which in some cases is impacting our ability to manufacture products and causing delays in delivery of our solutions to our customers 

for discussion of risks related to covid19 on our operations business results and financial condition see “item 1a risk factors” 

years ended october 31 2021 2020 and 2019 

we realized the most notable impacts of the covid19 virus control measures in the last half of the second quarter and continuing into the third quarter of fiscal 2020 with sequential improvement each quarter thereafter during the year ended october 31 2020 our orders revenues and margins were adversely impacted by site closures and supply chain disruptions resulting from the global disruptions and shutdown of our production facilities resulting in a soft priorperiod compare 

total orders for 2021 were 5356 million an increase of 18 percent when compared to 2020 foreign currency movements and acquisitions each contributed 1 percentage point to the order growth for 2021 when compared to 2020 orders grew doubledigits across all regions total orders for 2020 were 4528 million an increase of 2 percent when compared to 2019 foreign 

  

currency movements had an immaterial impact on the yearoveryear comparison orders associated with acquisitions contributed 1 percent to the order growth for 2020 when compared to 2019 order growth in asia pacific was partially offset by a decline in europe while the americas remained flat 

revenue of 4941 million for 2021 increased 17 percent when compared to 2020 foreign currency movements and acquisitions each contributed 1 percentage point to the revenue growth for 2021 as compared to 2020 revenue for both the communications solutions group and the electronic industrial solutions group grew as compared to 2020 driven by strong demand across all the regions and markets revenue from the communications solutions group and the electronic industrial solutions group represented approximately 71 percent and 29 percent respectively of total revenue for 2021 revenue of 4221 million for 2020 decreased 2 percent when compared to 2019 foreign currency movements had an immaterial impact on the yearoveryear comparison revenue associated with acquisitions had a 1 percentage point favorable impact on revenue for 2020 when compared to 2019 revenue for both the communications solutions group and electronic industrial solutions group declined as compared to 2019 due to the impact of site closures and supply chain disruptions related to the covid19 pandemic revenue from the communications solutions group and the electronic industrial solutions group represented approximately 74 percent and 26 percent respectively of total revenue for 2020 

net income was 894 million in 2021 compared to net income of 627 million and 621 million in 2020 and 2019 respectively the increase in net income for 2021 when compared to 2020 was primarily driven by higher revenue volume lower amortization of acquisitionrelated balances and lower income tax expense partially offset by an increase in variable peoplerelated costs higher rd investments lower operating income due to a onetime priorperiod gain related to an insurance settlement a loss on a partial settlement of our netherlands defined benefit plan and the incremental costs of acquired businesses the increase in net income for 2020 when compared to 2019 was driven by favorable mix a decline in variable compensation and a reduction in discretionary spending partially offset by lower revenue volume due to the impact of site closures and supply chain disruptions as well as higher income tax expense in 2021 2020 and 2019 we generated operating cash flows of 1322 million 1016 million and 998 million respectively 

outlook 

our strategy of bringing firsttomarket solutions that help customers develop new technologies and accelerate innovation provides a platform for longterm growth we expect our customers to continue to make rd investments in certain nextgeneration technologies we are still in the early market stages for technologies such as 5g6g nextgeneration automotive internet of things iot and defense modernization and expect technology investments to continue we continue to closely monitor the current macro environment related to trade tariffs monetary and fiscal policies pandemics or epidemics such as the covid19 outbreak and the related global supply chain challenges we remain confident in our longterm secular market growth trends and the strength of our operating model 

currency exchange rate exposure 

our revenues costs and expenses and monetary assets and liabilities are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our global operating and financing activities we hedge revenues expenses and balance sheet exposures that are not denominated in the functional currencies of our subsidiaries on a shortterm and anticipated basis the result of the hedging has been included in our consolidated statement of operations we experience some fluctuations within individual lines of the consolidated balance sheet and consolidated statement of operations because our hedging program is not designed to offset the currency movements in each category of revenues expenses monetary assets and liabilities our hedging program is designed to hedge shortterm currency movements based on a rolling period of up to twelve months therefore we are exposed to currency fluctuations over the longer term to the extent that we are required to pay for all or portions of an acquisition price in foreign currencies we may enter into foreign exchange contracts to reduce the risk that currency movements will impact the us dollar cost of the transaction 

results from operations  years ended october 31 2021 2020 and 2019 

revenue 

revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of the promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services returns are recorded in the period received from the customer and historically have not been material 

  





the following table provides the percent change in revenue for the years ended october 31 2021 and 2020 by geographic region including and excluding the impact of foreign currency movements as compared to the respective prior year 



for the year ended october 31 2021 revenue grew across all the regions foreign currency movements had a favorable impact of 1 percentage point on total revenue growth in 2021 with a favorable impact of 4 percentage points in europe and 1 percentage point in asia pacific for the year ended october 31 2020 revenue declined in the americas and europe partially offset by growth in asia pacific due to the impact of temporary site closures and supply chain disruptions related to the covid19 pandemic foreign currency movements had an immaterial impact on total revenue in 2020 with a favorable impact of 1 percentage point in europe 

backlog 

backlog represents the amount of revenue expected from orders that have already been booked including orders for goods and services that have not been delivered to customers orders invoiced but not yet recognized as revenue and orders for goods that were shipped but not invoiced awaiting acceptance by customers andor completion of a commitment to a customer at october 31 2021 our unfilled backlog was approximately 2115 million as compared to approximately 1709 million at october 31 2020 primarily driven by strong order growth and an increase in solutions sales with a longer ordertorevenue cycle we expect the majority of unfilled backlog to be recognized as revenue within six months while backlog on any particular date can be an indicator of shortterm revenue performance it is not necessarily a reliable indicator of medium or longterm revenue performance 

  

costs and expenses 





gross margin increased 2 percentage points in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily driven by lower amortization of acquisitionrelated balances and higher revenue volume partially offset by higher variable peoplerelated costs gross margin increased 1 percentage point in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily driven by favorable mix and lower variable compensation partially offset by lower revenue volume due to the impact of site closures and supply chain disruptions 

excess and obsolete inventory charges were 27 million in 2021 29 million in 2020 and 27 million in 2019 

research and development expense increased 13 percent in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily driven by greater investments in key growth opportunities in our end markets and leadingedge technologies increase in variable peoplerelated costs and incremental costs of acquired businesses research and development expense increased 4 percent in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily driven by greater investments in key growth opportunities in our end markets and leadingedge technologies and incremental costs of acquired businesses partially offset by declines in variable compensation and a reduction in discretionary spending due to covid19 related disruptions 

selling general and administrative expenses increased 9 percent in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily driven by increases in variable and other peoplerelated costs infrastructurerelated costs and incremental costs of acquired businesses partially offset by reductions in travel and marketingrelated costs due to covid19 related disruptions selling general and administrative expenses decreased 5 percent in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily driven by declines in travel and marketingrelated costs due to covid19 related disruptions and variable and other peoplerelated costs partially offset by incremental costs of acquired businesses 

other operating expense income net was income of 17 million 44 million and 20 million for 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively other operating expense income net for 2020 includes a onetime gain of 32 million on an insurance settlement 

operating margin increased 4 percentage points in 2021 when compared to 2020 primarily driven by gross margin gains and lower operating expenses as a percentage of sales operating margin increased 2 percentage points in 2020 when compared to 2019 primarily driven by favorable revenue mix declines in travel and marketingrelated costs due to covid19 related disruptions and variable compensation partially offset by lower revenue volume 

our headcount was approximately 14300 at october 31 2021 compared to approximately 13900 at october 31 2020 

interest income and expense 

interest income for 2021 2020 and 2019 was 3 million 11 million and 23 million respectively and primarily relates to interest earned on our cash balances interest expense for 2021 2020 and 2019 was 79 million 78 million and 80 million respectively and primarily relates to interest on our senior notes 

other income expense net 

other income expense net for 2021 2020 and 2019 was income of 6 million 63 million and 61 million respectively and primarily includes income related to our defined benefit and postretirement benefit plans interest cost expected return on assets amortization of net actuarial loss and prior service credits and gains losses on settlements and curtailments and the change in fair value of our equity investments the decrease in net other income for 2021 when compared to 2020 was driven by a 16 million loss on partial settlement of our netherlands defined benefit plan and higher amortization of net actuarial 

  

losses we also recognized gains from insurance proceeds of 9 million and 15 million for the years ended october 31 2020 and 2019 respectively 

income taxes 



the effective tax rate was 11 percent 18 percent and 13 percent for 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively the tax rate in each of these years was lower than the us statutory rate primarily due to the proportion of worldwide earnings that are taxed at lower statutory tax rates in nonus jurisdictions the decrease in the effective tax rate from 2020 to 2021 is due to a change in the jurisdictional mix of nonus earnings offset by an increase in us taxes on nonus earnings a decrease due to the release of valuation allowance on netherlands net operating losses in 2021 and a decrease due to the 2021 actual tax impact of acquired entity integration as compared to the estimate at acquisition based on the finalization of the integration plan the increase in the effective tax rate from 2019 to 2020 is primarily due to the 2019 benefit from a release of tax reserves 

keysight benefits from tax incentives in several jurisdictions most significantly in singapore and malaysia that have granted us tax incentives that require renewal at various times in the future the tax incentives provide lower rates of taxation on certain classes of income and require thresholds of investments and employment or specific types of income in those jurisdictions the singapore tax incentive is due for renewal in 2024 and the malaysia incentive is due for renewal in 2025 the impact of the tax incentives decreased income taxes by 70 million 53 million and 47 million in 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively the increase in tax benefit from 2020 to 2021 is primarily due to a change in the jurisdictional mix of nonus earnings which increased the earnings taxed at incentive tax rates in 2021 

the calculation of our tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex tax law and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions although the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes the use of a recognition and measurement model the determination of whether an uncertain tax position has met those thresholds will continue to require significant judgment by management in accordance with the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes for all us and other tax jurisdictions we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes and interest will be due we include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes in the consolidated statements of operations accrued interest and penalties are included on the related tax liability line in the consolidated balance sheet 

at this time management does not believe that the outcome of any future or currently ongoing examination will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements we believe that we have an adequate provision for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations however the outcome of tax examinations cannot be predicted with certainty if the resolution of any tax issues that arise in any future or currently ongoing examinations are inconsistent with management’s expectations we may be required to adjust our tax provision for income taxes in the period in which such resolution occurs 

the open tax years for the us federal income tax return and most state income tax returns are from november 1 2017 through the current tax year for the majority of our foreign entities the open tax years are from november 1 2015 through the current tax year for certain foreign entities the tax years remain open at most back to the year 2008 given the number of years and numerous matters that remain subject to examination in various tax jurisdictions we are unable to estimate the range of possible changes to the balance of our unrecognized tax benefits 

keysight’s fiscal year 2018 us federal income tax return is currently under examination by the internal revenue service the tax cuts and jobs act was enacted in december 2017 and imposed a onetime us tax on foreign earnings not previously repatriated to the us known as the transition tax which was reported in keysight’s 2018 us federal income tax return 

  

the company is being audited in malaysia for the 2008 tax year this tax year predates our separation from agilent however pursuant to the agreement between agilent and keysight pertaining to tax matters as finalized at the time of separation for certain entities including malaysia any historical tax liability is the responsibility of keysight in the fourth quarter of 2017 keysight paid income taxes and penalties of 68 million on gains related to intellectual property rights our appeals to both the special commissioners of income tax and the high court in malaysia have been unsuccessful we have filed a notice of appeal with the court of appeal the company believes there are numerous defenses to the current assessment the statute of limitations for the 2008 tax year in malaysia was closed and the income in question is exempt from tax in malaysia the company is disputing this assessment and pursuing all avenues to resolve this issue favorably for the company 

segment overview 

we have two reportable operating segments the communications solutions group and the electronic industrial solutions group the profitability of each of the segments is measured after excluding sharebased compensation expense amortization of acquisitionrelated balances acquisition and integration costs a gain on an insurance settlement related to northern california wildfires restructuring costs interest income interest expense and other items

revenue from the commercial communications market represented approximately 68 percent of total communications solutions group revenue in 2021 and increased 8 percent as compared to 2020 with growth in the americas and europe partially offset by a decline in asia pacific the revenue growth was driven by improved economic conditions across the communications ecosystem partially offset by the impact of china trade restrictions in 2021 we continue to see investments in 5g fueled by the ongoing redesign of every aspect of communications systems including wireless access infrastructure wireline technologies data centers and the cloud revenue from the commercial communications market represented approximately 70 percent of total communications solutions group revenue in 2020 and was flat as compared to 2019 with growth in asia pacific offset by declines in the americas and europe in 2020 revenue remained flat primarily driven by continued investments in 5g across the design lifecycle from development to deployment offset by covid19 related site closures and supply chain disruptions 

revenue from the aerospace defense and government market represented approximately 32 percent of total communications solutions group revenue in 2021 and increased 23 percent as compared to 2020 with revenue growing across all regions the strong revenue growth was driven by increased customer demand and continued investment in space satellite electromagnetic spectrum operations and new commercial technologies like 5g and early 6g research applications revenue from the aerospace defense and government market represented approximately 30 percent of total communications solutions group revenue in 2020 and declined 5 percent as compared to 2019 with revenue declining across all regions the revenue decline was primarily driven by covid19 related site closures and supply chain disruptions and by lower investment in 

  

europe and asia we continue to see strength for our electromagnetic spectrum simulation platform as well as solutions for radar space satellite and 5g

financial condition 

liquidity and capital resources 

our liquidity is affected by many factors some of which are based on normal ongoing operations of our business and some of which arise from fluctuations related to global economics and markets our cash balances are generated and held in many locations throughout the world under certain circumstances local government regulations may limit our ability to move cash balances to meet cash needs we do not currently expect such regulations and restrictions to impact our ability to pay vendors and conduct operations throughout our global organization 

overview of cash flows 

our key cash flow activities were as follows 



operating activities 

cash flows from operating activities can fluctuate significantly from period to period as working capital needs the timing of payments for income taxes variable pay pension funding and other items impact reported cash flows 

net cash provided by operating activities increased by 306 million in 2021 as compared to 2020 and increased 18 million in 2020 as compared to 2019 

• net income in 2021 increased 267 million as compared to 2020 noncash adjustments to net income were lower by 54 million primarily due to a 94 million increase in deferred tax benefits and a 46 million decrease in amortization partially offset by a onetime priorperiod gain of 32 million related to an insurance recovery of property plant and equipment reflected as cash from investing activity a 16 million loss on a partial settlement of our netherlands defined benefit plan a 13 million increase in depreciation a 11 million increase in sharebased compensation expense and a 14 million increase from other miscellaneous noncash activities 

net income in 2020 increased by 6 million as compared to 2019 noncash adjustments in 2020 increased 34 million compared to 2019 primarily due to a 43 million increase in deferred tax expense a 10 million increase in sharebased compensation expense a 10 million increase in amortization expense and an 8 million increase in depreciation expense partially offset by an adjustment for a 32 million gain from an insurance settlement related to damage from the 2017 northern california wildfires which is reflected in investing activities and a 7 million decrease from other miscellaneous noncash activities 

• the aggregate of accounts receivable inventory and accounts payable used net cash of 112 million during 2021 compared to net cash used of 31 million in 2020 and 105 million in 2019 the amount of cash flow generated from or used by the aggregate of accounts receivable inventory and accounts payable depends on the cash conversion cycle which represents the number of days that elapse from the day we pay for the purchase of raw materials and components to the collection of cash from our customers and can be significantly impacted by the timing of shipments and purchases as well as collections and payments in a period 

• net cash provided for retirement and postretirement benefits was 7 million in 2021 compared to net cash used of 108 million and 37 million in 2020 and 2019 respectively the companys contributions to our us defined benefit 

  

plan were zero 100 million and zero in 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively the companys contributions to our nonus defined benefit plans were 8 million 10 million and 26 million in 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively we did not contribute to the keysight technologies inc health plan for retirees us postretirement benefit plan in 2021 2020 and 2019 

• the aggregate other movements in assets and liabilities provided net cash of 141 million during 2021 compared to net cash provided of 82 million in 2020 and 107 million in 2019 the difference between 2021 and 2020 activities is primarily due to higher variable compensation accruals net of payments and higher cash inflow from deferred revenue partially offset by an increase in prepaid current assets as compared to the same period last year the difference between 2020 and 2019 activities is primarily due to lower cash inflow from deferred revenue partially offset by an increase in deferred payroll taxes of 21 million and increase in cash from income taxes payable as compared to the same period last year in 2020 and 2019 we received insurance proceeds of 5 million and 37 million respectively associated with recovery from the 2017 northern california wildfires and a 2016 singapore warehouse fire 

investing activities 

net cash changes in investing activities primarily relates to investments in property plant and equipment and acquisitions of businesses to support our growth 

net cash used in investing activities decreased by 89 million in 2021 as compared to 2020 and increased by 246 million in 2020 as compared to 2019 investments in property plant and equipment increased 57 million as compared to 2020 and decreased 3 million in 2020 as compared to 2019 the increase in capital spending in 2021 was driven by capital investments to increase the resiliency of our supply chains 

in 2021 we used 353 million for investing activities including 174 million for purchases of property plant and equipment 102 million net of 11 million of cash acquired for the acquisition of sanjole inc a leader in wireless test and measurement solutions for protocol decoding and interoperability and 76 million net of cash acquired for other acquisition activities 

in 2020 we used 442 million for investing activities including 117 million for purchases of property plant and equipment 319 million net of 11 million of cash acquired for the acquisition of eggplant topco limited eggplant a software test automation platform provider that uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to automate test creation and test execution and 38 million net of cash acquired for other acquisition activities partially offset by receipt of insurance proceeds of 32 million for property plant and equipment damaged in the 2017 northern california wildfires 

in 2019 we used 196 million for investing activities including 120 million for purchases of property plant and equipment 88 million net of 56 million of cash acquired for the acquisition of prisma telecom testing a global provider of radio access network test solutions partially offset by receipt of 7 million from the sale of investments and 2 million from divestitures 

financing activities 

net cash changes in financing activities primarily relates to proceeds from issuance of common stock under employee stock plans tax payments related to net share settlement of equity awards and treasury stock repurchases 

net cash used in financing activities increased by 258 million in 2021 as compared to 2020 and increased by 291 million in 2020 as compared to 2019 the incremental increases were primarily due to high treasury stock repurchases 

in 2021 we used 671 million for financing activities primarily due to 673 million of treasury stock repurchases and 53 million of tax payments related to net share settlement of equity awards partially offset by 59 million of proceeds from issuance of common stock under employee stock plans 

in 2020 we used 413 million for financing activities primarily due to 411 million of treasury stock repurchases and 53 million of tax payments related to net share settlement of equity awards and 7 million of payments on shortterm debt partially offset by 58 million of proceeds from issuance of common stock under employee stock plans 

in 2019 we used 122 million for financing activities primarily due to 500 million of payments on shortterm debt 159 million of treasury stock repurchases and 26 million or tax payments related to net share settlement of equity awards partially offset by 496 million of proceeds from issuance of longterm debt net of issuance costs and 67 million from issuance of common stock under employee stock plans 

  

treasury stock repurchases 

on november 18 2020 our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing the purchase of up to 750 million of the company’s common stock on november 18 2021 our board of directors approved a new stock repurchase program authorizing the purchase of up to 1200 million of the company’s common stock replacing the previously approved november 2020 program under which 77 million remained the stock repurchase program may be commenced suspended or discontinued at any time at the company’s discretion and does not have an expiration date see issuer purchases of equity securities under part ii item 2 for additional information 

debt 



on july 30 2021 we entered into a new credit agreement that amended and restated our existing credit agreement dated february 15 2017 in its entirety and provides for a 750 million fiveyear unsecured revolving credit facility the “revolving credit facility” that will expire on july 30 2026 and bears interest at an annual rate of libor  1 percent along with a facility fee of 0125 percent per annum in addition the new credit agreement permits the company subject to certain customary conditions on one or more occasions to request to increase the total commitments under the revolving credit facility by up to 250 million in the aggregate we may use amounts borrowed under the facility for general corporate purposes as of october 31 2021 and october 31 2020 we had no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility we were in compliance with the covenants of the revolving credit facility during the year ended october 31 2021 see note 11 debt for additional information 

cash and cash requirements 

cash 



our cash and cash equivalents mainly consist of investments in institutional money market funds shortterm deposits held at major global financial institutions and similar short duration instruments with original maturities of 90 days or less we continuously monitor the creditworthiness of the financial institutions and money market fund asset managers with whom we invest our funds we utilize a variety of funding strategies in an effort to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed most significant international locations have access to internal funding through an offshore cash pool for working capital needs in addition a few locations that are unable to access internal funding have access to temporary local overdraft and shortterm working capital lines of credit 

cash requirements 

we have cash requirements to support working capital needs capital expenditures business acquisitions contractual obligations commitments principal and interest payments on debt and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations w e generally intend to use available cash and funds generated from our operations to meet these cash requirements but in the event that additional liquidity is required we may also borrow under our revolving credit facility 

  

the following table summarizes our short and longterm cash requirements as of october 31 2021 



senior notes obligations and interest payments on senior notes we have contractual obligations for principal and interest payments on our senior notes see note 11 debt for additional information 

operating lease commitments commitments under operating leases primarily relates to leasehold properties see note 10 leases for additional information 

commitments to contract manufacturers and suppliers we purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products see note 14 commitments and contingencies as of october 31 2021 we had noncancellable purchase commitments that aggregated to approximately 444 million of which the majority is for less than one year 

other purchase commitments other purchase commitments relate to contracts with professional services suppliers see note 14 commitments and contingencies 

other liabilities other liabilities primarily includes contract liabilities net pensions and postretirement benefit obligations employee compensation and benefits net tax liabilities standard warranties and other accrued liabilities the timing of cash flows associated with these obligations is based upon management’s estimates over the terms of these arrangements and is largely based upon historical experience 

of the tax liabilities included in the above table 66 million relates to a us transition tax liability and 160 million for uncertain tax positions the us transition tax liability which keysight has elected to pay over 8 years relates to a onetime us tax on those earnings that have not been previously repatriated to the us with regard to the 160 million of longterm liabilities for uncertain tax positions we are unable to accurately predict when these amounts will be realized or released however it is reasonably possible that there could be significant changes to our unrecognized tax benefits in the next twelve months due to a tax audit settlement or some other unforeseeable event see note 5 “income taxes” for additional information 

in addition to the obligations noted above as of october 31 2021 we had 40 million of outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds unrelated to the credit facility that were issued by various lenders 

for the next twelve months we do not expect to contribute to our us defined benefit plan and us postretirement benefit plan and we expect to contribute 12 million to our nonus defined benefit plans the ultimate amounts we will contribute depend upon among other things legal requirements underlying asset returns the plan’s funded status the anticipated tax deductibility of the contribution local practices market conditions interest rates and other factors see note 12 retirements plans and postretirements benefits 

additionally we expect capital spending to be between approximately 240 million and 260 million in 2022 with increasing capacity and technology investments 

as of october 31 2021 we believe our cash and cash equivalents cash generated from operations and our ability to access capital markets and credit lines will satisfy our cash needs for the foreseeable future both globally and domestically 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable although these estimates are based on managements best knowledge of current events and actions that may impact the company in the future actual results may be different from the estimates due to the covid19 pandemic 

  

there has been uncertainty and disruption in the global economy and our markets we are not aware of any specific event or circumstance that would require an update to our estimates or judgments or a revision of the carrying value of our assets or liabilities as of october 31 2021 an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur could materially change the financial statements our critical accounting policies are those that affect our financial statements materially and involve difficult subjective or complex judgments by management those policies are revenue recognition inventory valuation sharebased compensation retirement and postretirement plan assumptions valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets warranty loss contingencies restructuring and accounting for income taxes 

revenue recognition revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of the promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services we primarily generate revenue from the sale of products hardware andor software services or a combination thereof we enter into contracts that may involve multiple performance obligations and we allocate the transaction price between each performance obligation on the basis of relative standalone selling price “ssp” we recognize revenue following the fivestep model 

1 identify the contract with a customer generally we consider customer purchase orders which in some cases are governed by master sales or other purchase agreements to be the customer contract all of the following criteria must be met before we consider an agreement to qualify as a contract with a customer under the revenue standard i it must be approved by all parties ii each party’s rights regarding the goods and services to be transferred can be identified iii the payment terms for the goods and services can be identified iv the agreement has commercial substance and v the customer has the ability and intent to pay and collection of substantially all of the consideration is probable we exercise reasonable judgment to determine the customer’s ability and intent to pay which is based upon various factors including the customer’s historical payment experience or credit and financial information and credit risk management measures that we implement 

2 identify the performance obligations in the contract we assess whether each promised good or service is distinct for the purpose of identifying the various performance obligations in each contract promised goods and services are considered distinct provided that i the customer can benefit from the good or service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer and ii our promise to transfer the good or service to the customer is separately identifiable or distinct from other promises in the contract 

3 determine the transaction price transaction price reflects the amount of consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services our contracts may include terms that could cause variability in the transaction price including rebates rights of return tradein credits and discounts variable consideration is generally accounted for at the portfolio level and estimated based on historical information 

4 allocate the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract if the contract contains a single performance obligation the entire transaction price is allocated to that performance obligation many of our contracts include multiple performance obligations with a combination of distinct products and services maintenance and support professional services andor training for contracts with multiple performance obligations we allocate the total transaction value to each distinct performance obligation based on relative ssp judgment is required to determine the ssp for each distinct performance obligation the best evidence of ssp is the observable price of a good or service when we sell that good or service separately under similar circumstances to similar customers since most contracts contain multiple performance obligations we use information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs to estimate ssp when we don’t have standalone transactions 

5 recognize revenue when or as performance obligations are satisfied revenue is recognized at the point in time control is transferred to the customer for hardware sales transfer of control to the customer typically occurs at the point the product is shipped or delivered to the customer’s designated location for software license sales transfer of control to the customer typically occurs upon shipment electronic delivery or when the software is available for download by the customer for sales of implementation service and custom solutions or in instances where products are sold along with essential installation services transfer of control occurs and revenue is typically recognized upon customer acceptance for fixedprice support and extended warranty contracts or certain software arrangements that provide customers with a right to access over a discrete period control is deemed to transfer over time and revenue is recognized on a straightline basis over the contract term due to the standready nature of the performance obligation revenue from hardware repairs and calibration services outside of an extended warranty or support contract is recognized at the time of completion of the related service for other professional services or timebased labor contracts revenue is recognized as we perform the services and the customers receive andor consume the benefits 

  

inventory valuation we assess the valuation of our inventory on a periodic basis and make adjustments to the value for estimated excess and obsolete inventory based upon estimates about future demand and actual usage such estimates are difficult to make under most economic conditions the excess balance determined by this analysis becomes the basis for our excess inventory charge our excess inventory review process includes analysis of sales forecasts managing product rollovers and working with manufacturing to maximize recovery of excess inventory if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management additional writedowns may be required if actual market conditions are more favorable than anticipated inventory previously written down may be sold to customers resulting in lower cost of sales and higher income from operations than expected in that period 

sharebased compensation we account for sharebased awards in accordance with the provisions of the authoritative accounting guidance which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all sharebased payment awards made to our employees and directors awards granted under the keysight technologies inc longterm performance ltp program are based on a variety of targets such as total shareholder return tsr or financial metrics such as operating margin the awards based on tsr were valued using a monte carlo simulation model and those based on financial metrics were valued based on the market price of keysight’s common stock on the date of grant the compensation cost for financial metricsbased performance awards reflect the cost of awards that are probable to vest at the end of the performance period the monte carlo simulation fair value model requires the use of highly subjective and complex assumptions including the price volatility of the underlying stock for additional information on valuation assumptions see note 4 “sharebased compensation” the estimated fair value of restricted stock awards is determined based on the market price of keysight’s common stock on the date of grant we did not grant any option awards in 2021 2020 and 2019 

retirement and postretirement benefit plan assumptions retirement and postretirement benefit plan costs are a significant cost of doing business they represent obligations that will ultimately be settled sometime in the future and therefore are subject to estimation defined benefit plan obligations are remeasured at least annually as of october 31 based on the present value of future benefit payments to reflect the future benefit costs over the employees average expected future service to keysight based on the terms of the plans to estimate the present value of these future payments we are required to make assumptions using actuarial concepts within the framework of gaap two critical assumptions are the discount rate and the expected longterm return on plan assets other important assumptions include expected future salary increases expected future increases to benefit payments expected retirement dates employee turnover retiree mortality rates and investment portfolio composition we evaluate these assumptions at least annually see note 12 retirement plans and postretirement benefit plans 

the discount rate is used to determine the present value of future benefit payments at the measurement date which is october 31 for both us and nonus plans the us discount rates as of october 31 2021 and 2020 were determined based on the results of matching expected plan benefit payments with cash flows from a hypothetically constructed bond portfolio the nonus discount rates as of october 31 2021 and 2020 were determined using spot rates along the yield curve to calculate disaggregated discount rates in addition we used this method to calculate two components of the periodic benefit cost service cost and interest cost if we changed our discount rate by 1 percent the impact would be 7 million on us net periodic benefit cost and 12 million on nonus net periodic benefit cost lower discount rates increase the present value of the liability and subsequent year pension expense higher discount rates decrease the present value of the liability and subsequent year pension expense 

the company uses alternate methods of amortization as allowed by the authoritative guidance that amortizes the actuarial gains and losses on a consistent basis for the years presented for us plans gains and losses are amortized over the average future working lifetime for most nonus plans and us postretirement benefit plans gains and losses are amortized using a separate layer for each years gains and losses the expected longterm return on plan assets is estimated using current and expected asset allocations as well as historical and expected returns plan assets are valued at fair value if we changed our estimated return on assets by 1 percent the impact would be 9 million on us net periodic benefit cost and 15 million on nonus net periodic benefit cost 

goodwill and other intangible assets we review goodwill for impairment annually during our fourth fiscal quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable as defined in the authoritative guidance a reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment at the time of an acquisition we assign goodwill to the reporting unit that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination 

companies have the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether performing a quantitative test is necessary if an entity believes as a result of its qualitative assessment that it is morelikelythannot that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount the quantitative impairment test will be required otherwise no further testing will be required 

  

the quantitative impairment test involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount including goodwill we determine the fair value of a reporting unit using the results derived using the market approach when available and appropriate or the income approach or a combination of both if multiple valuation methodologies are used the results are weighted accordingly the income approach is estimated through the discounted cash flow “dcf” analysis determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgment including judgments about appropriate discount rates revenue growth rates and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows discount rates are based on a weighted average cost of capital “wacc” which represents the average rate a business must pay its providers of debt and equity plus a risk premium the wacc used to test goodwill is derived from a group of comparable companies the cash flows employed in the dcf analysis are derived from internal forecasts and external market forecasts the market approach estimates the fair value of the reporting unit by utilizing the market comparable method which is based on revenue and earnings multiples from comparable companies if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value then an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting units fair value up to a maximum amount of the goodwill balance for the reporting unit 

during the fourth quarter of 2021 we performed our annual impairment test of goodwill for all our reporting units using a qualitative approach except for our eggplant reporting unit which is included in our eisg reportable segment for which the test was performed using a quantitative approach the income and market approaches were used to determine the fair value of the eggplant reporting unit with respect to the income approach the discounted cash flow method was used which included a forecasted cash flow projection and an estimated terminal value the market approach used revenue gross margin and ebitda multiples to develop an estimate of fair value a weighting of 75 percent and 25 percent was applied to the income and market approaches respectively to determine the fair value of the eggplant reporting unit the income approach was given a larger weighting based on the underlying detailed financial projections prepared during the strategic planning cycle that reflect the financial and operational facts and circumstances specific to eggplant as of the valuation date based on the results of our annual impairment tests the fair value of each of our reporting units exceeded the carrying value 

other intangible assets consist primarily of developed technologies proprietary knowhow trademarks customer relationships noncompete agreements and backlog and are amortized using the straightline method over estimated useful lives ranging from 6 months to 12 years we review other intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of these assets are no longer appropriate we performed an impairment test of eggplant and our previous ixia solutions groups longlived assets in 2021 and 2019 respectively which preceded the quantitative test of goodwill in accordance with the guidance and concluded that no impairment charge was required no impairments of purchased intangible assets were recorded during the years ended october 31 2021 2020 and 2019 

we review indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of these assets are no longer appropriate the authoritative accounting guidance allows a qualitative approach for testing indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment similar to the impairment testing guidance for goodwill it allows the option to first assess qualitative factors events and circumstances that could have affected the significant inputs used in determining the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset the qualitative factors assist in determining whether it is morelikelythannot that the indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired an organization may choose to bypass the qualitative assessment for any indefinitelived intangible asset in any period and proceed directly to calculating its fair value our indefinitelived intangible assets are inprocess research and development iprd intangible assets in 2021 2020 and 2019 we assessed impairment by performing a qualitative test no material impairments of indefinitelived intangible assets were recorded in 2021 2020 and 2019 

warranty keysight warranties on products sold through direct sales channels are primarily for one year warranties for products sold through distribution channels are primarily for three years we accrue for standard warranty costs based on historical trends in warranty charges the accrual is reviewed regularly and periodically adjusted to reflect changes in warranty cost estimates estimated warranty charges are recorded within cost of products at the time related product revenue is recognized 

we also sell extended warranties that provide warranty coverage beyond the standard warranty term revenue associated with extended warranties is deferred and recognized over the extended coverage period 

loss contingencies as discussed in note 13 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements we are from time to time subject to a variety of litigation and similar contingent liabilities incidental to our business or the business operations of previously owned entities we recognize a liability for any contingency that is known or probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable these assessments require judgments concerning matters such as litigation developments and outcomes the anticipated outcome of negotiations the number of future claims and the cost of both pending and future claims in addition 

  

because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time liabilities may change in the future due to various factors changes in these factors could materially impact our financial position or our results of operation 

restructuring the main component of our restructuring plan is related to workforce reductions and site restructuring workforce reduction charges are accrued when payment of benefits becomes probable and the amounts can be estimated if the amounts and timing of cash flows from restructuring activities are significantly different from what we have estimated the actual amount of restructuring and other related charges could be materially different either higher or lower than those we have recorded 

accounting for income taxes we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax benefits credits and deductions and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities that arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period 

significant management judgment is also required in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part when it is morelikelythannot that all or some portion of specific deferred tax assets such as net operating losses or foreign tax credit carryforwards will not be realized a valuation allowance must be established for the amount of the deferred tax assets that cannot be realized we consider all available positive and negative evidence on a jurisdictionbyjurisdiction basis when assessing whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable we consider evidence such as our past operating results the existence of losses in recent years and our forecast of future taxable income at october 31 2021 the company maintains a valuation allowance mainly related to net operating losses in luxembourg and the uk capital losses in the uk and california research credits we intend to maintain a valuation allowance in these jurisdictions until sufficient positive evidence exists to support their reversal 

the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax law and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions although the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes the use of a recognition and measurement model the determination of whether an uncertain tax position has met those thresholds will continue to require significant judgment by management in accordance with the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes for all us and other tax jurisdictions we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes and interest will be due the ultimate resolution of tax uncertainties may differ from what is currently estimated which could result in a material impact on income tax expense if our estimate of income tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment a further charge to expense would be required if events occur and the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary we include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes in the consolidated statements of operations

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

at various times we use derivative financial instruments to limit exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates because derivative instruments are used solely as hedges and not for speculative trading purposes fluctuations in the market values of such derivative instruments are generally offset by reciprocal changes in the underlying economic exposures that the instruments are intended to hedge for further discussion of derivative financial instruments see note 9 derivatives 

  

currency exchange rate risk 

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks inherent in our sales commitments anticipated sales expenses and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries we hedge future cash flows denominated in currencies other than the functional currency using sales and expense forecasts on a rolling period of up to twelve months our exposure to exchange rate risks is managed on an enterprisewide basis this strategy utilizes derivative financial instruments primarily forward contracts to hedge certain foreign currency exposures with the intent of offsetting gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposures with gains and losses on the derivative contracts hedging them we do not currently and do not intend to utilize derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes to the extent that we are required to pay for all or portions of an acquisition price in foreign currencies we may enter into foreign exchange contracts to reduce the risk that currency movements will impact the cost of the transaction 

our operations generate nonfunctional currency cash flows such as revenue thirdparty vendor payments and intercompany payments in anticipation of these foreign currency cash flows and in view of the volatility of the currency market we enter into foreign exchange contracts as described above to substantially mitigate our currency risk in 2021 2020 and 2019 approximately 77 percent 76 percent and 74 percent of our revenues were generated in us dollars 

the unfavorable effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates principally as a result of the strength of the us dollar had an immaterial impact on our revenue in the year ended october 31 2021 we calculate the impact of foreign currency exchange rates movements by applying the actual foreign currency exchange rates in effect during the last month of each quarter to the current year to both the applicable current and prior year periods we also performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10 percent adverse movement in foreign exchange rates to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above as of october 31 2021 and 2020 the analysis indicated that these hypothetical market movements would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

interest rate risk 

a change in interest rates on longterm debt impacts the fair value of the company’s fixedrate longterm debt but not the company’s earnings or cash flow because the interest on such debt is fixed generally the fair market value of fixedrate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 

as of october 31 2021 a hypothetical 10 percent increase in interest rates would have decreased the fair value of the company’s fixedrate longterm debt by approximately 17 million however since the company currently has no plans to repurchase its outstanding fixedrate instruments before their maturity nor do the investors in our fixedrate debt obligations have the right to demand we pay off these obligations prior to maturity the impact of market interest rate fluctuations on the company’s fixedrate longterm debt does not affect the company’s results of operations or stockholders’ equity

 item 1a risk factors 

risks uncertainties and other factors that may affect future results 

risks related to our business 

global health crises such as the covid19 pandemic could have a material impact on our global operations and the operations of our supply chain customers and vendors which could adversely impact our business results and financial condition 

in march 2020 the world health organization declared covid19 a global pandemic in response to the rapid global spread of the virus national state and local governments issued orders and recommendations to attempt to reduce the further spread of the disease such orders included movement control and shelterinplace orders travel restrictions limitations on public gatherings school closures social distancing requirements and the closure of all but critical and essential services and infrastructure in response to these measures and to protect the health and safety of our employees we temporarily closed our facilities globally and asked all employees who can work from home to do so for the foreseeable future made substantial changes to employee travel policies and canceled training and marketing events or moved them to a virtual format as a supplier to some critical and essential businesses we have restarted onsite operations using only employees who are not able to work effectively from home and where doing so is in compliance with local regulations and our covid19 safety procedures our customers suppliers and vendors are all subject to these restrictions and orders and are similarly impacted fluctuation in infection rates in the regions in which we operate has resulted in periodic changes in restrictions that vary from region to region and require vigilant attention and rapid response to new or reinstated restrictions 

the uncertain duration and severity of the pandemic as well as periodic spikes in infection rates local outbreaks of the virus or potential outbreaks on our sites or supplier customer or vendor sites in spite of safety measures could cause further shutdowns of our operations or those of our suppliers customers or vendors any outbreaks causing renewed implementation or extension of existing government orders could also impact the availability of our employees or other workers as more is understood about the virus and how it is spread new health orders and safety protocols could further impact our on site operations adverse impact to our suppliers could adversely impact our ability to procure components and materials causing an inability to manufacture products or solutions customers could reduce spending causing reduced demand for products and solutions delayed or canceled orders and inability to pay for products and solutions lack of employee availability due to shutdowns caused by government orders illness or quarantine requirements could further impact our ability to manufacture ship or deliver products and solutions to customers continued implementation of measures to reduce the spread of the virus may impact our ability to collaborate globally with customers suppliers and internal colleagues continued uncertainty and market volatility could result in a national or global recession which could create additional market and global financial instability these factors could materially and negatively impact our business results operations revenue growth and overall financial condition 

uncertainty in general economic conditions may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

our business is sensitive to negative changes in general economic conditions both inside and outside the united states global and regional economic uncertainty recession or depression may impact our business resulting in 

 in addition global and regional macroeconomic developments such as increased unemployment decreased income uncertainty related to future economic activity reduced access to credit volatility in capital markets decreased liquidity uncertain or destabilizing national election results in the us europe and asia and negative changes or volatility in general economic conditions in the us europe and asia could negatively affect our ability to conduct business in those territories financial difficulties experienced by our suppliers and customers including distributors due to economic volatility or negative changes could result in product delays delays in payment or inability to pay us and inventory issues economic risks related to accounts receivable could result in delays in collection and greater bad debt expense 

our operating results and financial condition could be harmed if the markets into which we sell our solutions decline or do not grow as anticipated 

visibility into our markets is limited our quarterly sales and operating results are highly dependent on the volume and timing of technologyrelated spending and orders received during the fiscal quarter which are difficult to forecast and may be cancelled 

  

by our customers in addition our revenues and earnings forecasts for future fiscal quarters are often based on the expected seasonality or cyclicality of our markets however due to the uncertainties and negative economic environment created by the current global pandemic the markets we serve may experience increased volatility and may not experience the seasonality or cyclicality that we expect any decline in our customers markets would likely result in a reduction in demand for our solutions and services the broader semiconductor market is one of the drivers for our business and therefore a decrease in the semiconductor market could harm our business also if our customers markets decline we may not be able to collect on outstanding amounts due to us such declines could harm our financial position results of operations cash flows and stock price and could limit our profitability also in such an environment pricing pressures could intensify since a significant portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed in nature due to sales rd and manufacturing costs if we were unable to respond quickly enough these pricing pressures could further reduce our operating margins 

economic and political policies favoring national interests could adversely affect our results of operations 

nationalistic economic policies and political trends in the united states the united kingdom the european union singapore malaysia and china among other countries such as opposition to globalization and free trade sanctions or trade restrictions withdrawal from or renegotiation of global trade agreements tax policies that favor domestic industries and interests the exit of the united kingdom from the european union known as brexit the distancing or potential exit of other countries from the european union and other similar actions may result in increased transaction costs reduced ability to hire employees reduced access to supplies and materials reduced demand or access to customers in international markets and inability to conduct our operations as they have been conducted historically each of these factors may adversely affect our business 

international trade disputes and increased tariffs between the united states and such jurisdictions could substantially change our expectations and ability to operate in such jurisdictions as we have done historically many of our suppliers vendors customers partners and other entities with whom we do business have strong ties to doing business in china their ability to supply materials to us buy products or services from us or otherwise work with us is affected by their ability to do business in china the deterioration of the us’s relationship with china could result in additional trade disputes trade protection measures retaliatory actions tariffs and increased barriers policies that favor domestic industries or increased import or export licensing requirements or restrictions then our deployment of resources in jurisdictions affected by such measures could be misaligned and our operations may be adversely affected due to such changes in the economic and political ecosystem in which our suppliers vendors customers partners and other entities with whom we do business operate 

a decreased demand for our customers’ products or trade restrictions could adversely affect our results of operations 

our business depends on our customers’ ability to manufacture design and sell their products in the marketplace international trade disputes affecting our customers could adversely affect our business tariffs on imports to or from china could increase the cost of our customers’ components and raw materials which could make our customers’ products and services more expensive and could reduce demand for our customers’ products protectionist and retaliatory trade measures by either china or the united states could limit our customers’ ability to sell their products and services and could reduce demand of our customers’ products our customers and other entities in our customer chain could decide to take actions in response to international trade disputes that we could not foresee a decrease in demand or significant change in operations from our customers due to international trade disputes could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

in addition to the above our customers and suppliers could become subject to us export restrictions and sanctions such as being added to the us department of commerce’s “lists of parties of concern” and having us export privileges denied or suspended in the event that a customer or supplier of ours becomes subject to such sanctions we will suspend our business with such customer or supplier because of the increasingly tense political and economic relationship between the united states and china new sanctions could be imposed with little notice which could leave us without an adequate alternative solution to compensate for our inability to continue to do business with such customer or supplier some of our suppliers and customers in the supply chain are working on unique solutions and products in the market and it may be difficult if not impossible to replace them especially with short notice we cannot predict what impact future sanctions could have on our customers or suppliers and therefore our business any export restrictions or sanctions and any tariffs or other trade restriction imposed on our customers or suppliers could adversely affect our financial condition and business 

economic political and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our results of operations 

because we sell our solutions worldwide our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally we anticipate that revenue from international operations will continue to represent a majority of our total revenue however there can be no assurances that our international sales will continue at existing levels or grow in accordance with our effort to increase foreign market penetration in addition many of our employees contract manufacturers suppliers job functions and manufacturing 

  

facilities are located outside the united states accordingly our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors including but not limited to 

 we centralize most of our accounting processes at two locations india and malaysia these processes include general accounting inventory cost accounting accounts payable and accounts receivables functions if conditions change in those countries it may adversely affect operations including impairing our ability to pay our suppliers our results of operations as well as our liquidity may be adversely affected and possible delays may occur in reporting financial results 

further even if we are able to successfully manage the risks of international operations our business may be adversely affected if our business partners are not able to successfully manage similar risks 

failure to introduce successful new solutions and services in a timely manner to address increased competition rapid technological changes and changing industry standards could result in our solutions and services becoming obsolete 

we generally sell our solutions in industries that are characterized by increased competition through frequent new solution and service introductions rapid technological changes and changing industry standards in addition many of the markets in which we operate are seasonal and cyclical without the timely introduction of new solutions services and enhancements our solutions and services will become technologically obsolete over time in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer our ability to offer new solutions and services and to deploy them in a timely manner depend on several factors including but not limited to our ability to 



  

the covid19 global pandemic could impact our ability to execute on these dependencies it may be difficult to differentiate ourselves from our competitors due to limited travel and access to customers which could make it difficult to properly assess customer needs and interruptions in manufacturing and delivery of solutions 

our future operating results may fluctuate significantly if our investments in innovative technologies are not as profitable as we anticipate 

on a regular basis we review the existing technologies available in the market and identify strategic new technologies to develop and invest in we are currently devoting significant resources to the 5g technology and other new technologies in the automotive battery internet of things and mobile industries we are investing in rd developing relationships with customers and suppliers and redirecting our corporate and operational resources to grow within these innovative technologies our income could be harmed if we fail to gain sufficient market share if demand for our solutions is lower than we expect or if our income related to the innovative technologies is lower than we anticipate for example when the 5g standards are published we may not be able to produce a satisfactory return on investment if our strategic vision and the resources that we are spending on developing our presence in the 5g technology industry turn out to be misaligned with such standards we provide solutions for the design development and manufacturing stages of our customers’ workflow our customers who currently use our solutions in one stage of their workflow may not use our solutions in other aspects of their manufacturing process 

failure to adjust our purchases due to changing market conditions or failure to estimate our customers demand could adversely affect our income 

our income could be harmed if we are unable to adjust our purchases to market fluctuations including those caused by the seasonal or cyclical nature of the markets in which we operate the sale of our solutions and services are dependent to a large degree on customers whose industries are subject to seasonal or cyclical trends in the demand for their products for example the consumer electronics market is particularly volatile making demand difficult to anticipate making such estimations in the current economic climate affected by the global pandemic is particularly difficult as increased volatility may impact seasonal trends making it more difficult to anticipate demand fluctuations during a market upturn we may not be able to purchase sufficient supplies or components to meet increasing product demand which could materially affect our results in the past we have seen a shortage of parts for some of our products in addition some of the parts that require custom design are not readily available from alternate suppliers due to their unique design or the length of time necessary for design work should a supplier cease manufacturing such a component we would be forced to reengineer our solution in addition to discontinuing parts suppliers may also extend lead times limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors the covid19 pandemic may further exacerbate these risks as suppliers are impacted by surging infection rates possible shutdown orders or new safety restrictions in order to secure components for the production of products we may continue to enter into noncancellable purchase commitments with vendors or at times make advance payments to suppliers which could impact our ability to adjust our inventory to declining market demands prior commitments of this type have resulted in an excess of parts when demand for electronic products has decreased if demand for our solutions is less than we expect we may experience additional excess and obsolete inventories and be forced to incur additional charges 

dependence on contract manufacturing and outsourcing other portions of our supply chain may adversely affect our ability to bring solutions to market and damage our reputation dependence on outsourced information technology and other administrative functions may impair our ability to operate effectively 

as part of our efforts to streamline operations and to cut costs we outsource aspects of our manufacturing processes and other functions and continue to evaluate additional outsourcing if our contract manufacturers or other outsourcers fail to perform their obligations in a timely manner or at satisfactory quality levels our ability to bring solutions to market and our reputation could suffer for example during a market upturn our contract manufacturers may be unable to meet our demand requirements which may preclude us from fulfilling our customers orders on a timely basis the ability of these manufacturers to perform is largely outside of our control additionally changing or replacing our contract manufacturers or other outsourced vendors could cause disruptions or delays in addition we outsource significant portions of our information technology it and other administrative functions since it is critical to our operations any failure of our it providers to perform could impair our ability to operate effectively in addition to the risks outlined above problems with manufacturing or it outsourcing could result in lower revenues and unrealized efficiencies and could impact our results of operations and stock price much of our outsourcing takes place in developing countries and as a result may be subject to geopolitical uncertainty 

our operating results may suffer if our manufacturing capacity does not match the demand for our solutions 

because we cannot immediately adapt our production capacity and related cost structures to rapidly changing market conditions when demand does not meet our expectations our manufacturing capacity will likely exceed our production requirements during a general market upturn or an upturn in our business we cannot increase our manufacturing capacity to meet product demand we will not be able to fulfill orders in a timely manner which could lead to order cancellations contract breaches or indemnification 

  

obligations this inability could materially and adversely limit our ability to improve our income margin and operating results by contrast if during an economic downturn we had excess manufacturing capacity then our fixed costs associated with excess manufacturing capacity would adversely affect our income margins and operating results 

key customers or large orders may expose us to additional business and legal risks that could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition  

as a global company we have key customers all over the world although no one customer makes up more than 10 percent of our revenue trade restrictions sanctions and embargos could force reductions in sales to or prevent us from selling large orders to certain key customers which could impact our income operating results and financial condition 

certain key customers have substantial purchasing power and leverage in negotiating contractual arrangements with us these customers may demand contract terms that differ considerably from our standard terms and conditions large orders may also include severe contractual liabilities for us if we fail to provide the quantity and quality of product at the required delivery times while we attempt to contractually limit our potential liability under such contracts we may have to agree to some or all of these types of provisions to secure these orders and to continue to grow our business such actions expose us to significant additional risks which could result in a material adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition 

industry consolidation and consolidation among our customer base may lead to increased competition and may harm our operating results 

there is potential for industry consolidation in our markets as companies attempt to strengthen or hold their market positions in an evolving industry companies could be acquired or may be unable to continue operations companies that are strategic alliance partners in some areas of our business may acquire or form alliances with our competitors thereby reducing their business with us we believe that industry consolidation may result in stronger competitors and could lead to more variability in our operating results and could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition furthermore particularly in the communications market rapid consolidation would lead to fewer customers with the effect that loss of a major customer could have a material impact on results not anticipated in a customer marketplace composed of more numerous participants 

additionally if there is consolidation among our customer base our customers may be able to command increased leverage in negotiating prices and other terms of sale which could adversely affect our profitability in addition if as a result of increased leverage customer pressures require us to reduce our pricing such that our gross margins are diminished we could decide not to sell our solutions under such less favorable terms which would decrease our revenue consolidation among our customer base may also lead to reduced demand for our solutions replacement of our products by the combined entity with those of our competitors and cancellations of orders each of which could harm our operating results 

our acquisitions strategic alliances joint ventures internal reorganizations and divestitures may result in financial results that are different than expected 

in the normal course of business we may engage in discussions with third parties relating to possible acquisitions strategic alliances joint ventures and divestitures additionally we occasionally make changes to our internal structure to align business products services and solutions with market demands and to obtain cost synergies and operational efficiencies as a result of such transactions our financial results may differ from our own or the investment communitys expectations in a given fiscal quarter or over the long term if market conditions or other factors lead us to change our strategic direction we may not realize the expected value from such transactions or reorganizations further such thirdparty transactions often have postclosing arrangements including but not limited to postclosing adjustments transition services escrows or indemnifications the financial results of which can be difficult to predict in addition acquisitions and strategic alliances may require us to integrate a different company culture management team employees and business infrastructure into our existing operations without impacting the business operations of the newly acquired company we may have difficulty developing manufacturing and marketing the products of a newly acquired company in a way that enhances performance and expands the markets of the newly acquired company the acquired company may not enhance the performance of our businesses or product lines such that we do not realize the value from expected synergies depending on the size and complexity of an acquisition the successful integration of the entity depends on a variety of factors including but not limited to 



  

 if we do not realize the expected benefits or synergies of such transactions our consolidated financial position results of operations cash flows and stock price could be negatively impacted additionally we may record significant goodwill and other assets as a result of acquisitions or investments and we may be required to incur impairment charges which could adversely affect our consolidated financial position and results of operations 

any inability to complete acquisitions on acceptable terms could negatively impact our growth rate and financial performance 

our ability to grow revenues earnings and cash flow depends in part upon our ability to identify and successfully acquire and integrate businesses at appropriate prices and realize anticipated synergies and business performance appropriate targets for acquisition are difficult to identify and complete for a variety of reasons including but not limited to limited due diligence high valuations business and intellectual property evaluations other interested parties negotiations of the definitive documentation satisfaction of closing conditions the need to obtain antitrust or other regulatory approvals on acceptable terms and availability of funding the inability to close appropriate acquisitions on acceptable terms could adversely impact our growth rate revenue and financial performance 

we may need additional financing in the future to meet our capital needs or to make opportunistic acquisitions and such financing may not be available on terms favorable to us if at all and may be dilutive to existing shareholders 

we may need to seek additional financing for our general corporate purposes for example we may need to increase our investment in rd activities or need funds to make acquisitions we may be unable to obtain any desired additional financing on terms favorable to us if at all if adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms we may be unable to fund our expansion successfully develop or enhance solutions or respond to competitive pressures any of which could negatively affect our business if we finance acquisitions by issuing additional convertible debt or equity securities our existing stockholders may experience share dilution which could affect the market price of our stock if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity securities our shareholders will experience dilution of their ownership interest if we raise additional funds by issuing debt we may be subject to further limitations on our operations and ability to pay dividends due to restrictive covenants 

we have outstanding debt and may incur other debt in the future which could adversely affect our financial condition liquidity and results of operations 

we currently have outstanding debt as well as availability to borrow under a revolving credit facility we may borrow additional amounts in the future and use the proceeds from any future borrowing for general corporate purposes future acquisitions expansion of our business or repurchases of our outstanding shares of common stock 

our incurrence of this debt and increases in our aggregate levels of debt may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition by among other things 

 our current revolving credit facility and term loan imposes restrictions on us including restrictions on our ability to create liens on our assets and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur indebtedness and requires us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios our ability to comply with these ratios may be affected by events beyond our control in addition the indenture governing our senior notes contains covenants that may adversely affect our ability to incur certain liens or engage in certain types of sale and leaseback transactions if we breach any of the covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders then subject to applicable cure periods our outstanding indebtedness could be declared immediately due and payable 

  

if currency exchange rates fluctuate substantially in the future our financial results could be adversely affected 

a substantial amount of our solutions are priced and paid for in us dollars although many of our solutions are priced in local currencies and a significant amount of certain types of expenses such as payroll utilities tax and marketing expenses are paid in local currencies our hedging programs are designed to reduce but not entirely eliminate within any given 12month period the impact of currency exchange rate movements including those caused by currency controls which could impact our business operating results and financial condition by resulting in lower revenue or increased expenses however for expenses beyond a 12month period our hedging strategy will not mitigate our exchange rate risk in addition our currency hedging programs involve thirdparty financial institutions as counterparties the weakening or failure of these counterparties may adversely affect our hedging programs and our financial condition through among other things a reduction in the number of available counterparties increasingly unfavorable terms or the failure of counterparties to perform under hedging contracts 

volatile changes in weather conditions and effects of climate change could damage or destroy strategic facilities including our headquarters which could have a significant negative impact on our operations 

we and our customers and suppliers are vulnerable to the increasing impact of climate change volatile changes in weather conditions including extreme heat or cold could increase the risk of wildfires floods blizzards hurricanes and other weatherrelated disasters disasters created by extreme conditions could cause significant damage to or destruction of our facilities resulting in temporary or longterm closures of our facilities and operations and significant expense for repair or replacement of damaged or destroyed facilities this could also result in loss or damage to employee homes employees relocating to other parts of the country or being unwilling to relocate to the strategic locations housing shortages and loss of or inability to recruit key employees this could result in adverse impact to the available workforce damage to or destruction of inventory inability to manufacture and deliver solutions cancellation of orders and breaches of customer contracts leading to reduced revenue 

if we suffer a loss to our employees factories facilities or distribution system due to a catastrophic event our operations could be significantly harmed 

our factories facilities and distribution system are vulnerable to catastrophic loss due to natural or manmade disasters such as earthquakes and terrorism several of our facilities could be subject to a catastrophic loss caused by earthquake or other natural disasters due to their locations for example our production facilities headquarters and laboratories in california and our production facilities in japan are all located in areas with aboveaverage seismic activity if any of these facilities were to experience a catastrophic loss it could disrupt our operations delay production shipments and revenue and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility in addition since we have consolidated our manufacturing facilities we are more likely to experience an interruption to our operations in the event of a catastrophe in any one location although we carry insurance for property damage and business interruption we do not carry insurance or financial reserves for interruptions or potential losses arising from earthquakes or terrorism also our thirdparty insurance coverage will vary from time to time in both type and amount depending on availability cost and our decisions with respect to risk retention economic conditions and uncertainties in global markets may adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain thirdparty insurance if our thirdparty insurance coverage is adversely affected or to the extent we have elected to selfinsure we may be at a greater risk that our operations will be harmed by a catastrophic loss 

third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property rights and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling solutions or services 

third parties may claim that one or more of our solutions or services infringe their intellectual property rights we analyze and take action in response to such claims on a casebycase basis any dispute or litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and timeconsuming due to the complexity of our technology and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation and could divert our management and key personnel from business operations a claim of intellectual property infringement could cause us to enter into a costly or restrictive license agreement which may not be available under acceptable terms or at all require us to redesign certain of our solutions which would be costly and timeconsuming andor subject us to significant damages or an injunction against the development and sale of certain solutions or services in certain of our businesses we rely on thirdparty intellectual property licenses and we cannot ensure that these licenses will be available to us in the future on terms favorable to us or at all 

third parties may infringe our intellectual property rights and we may suffer competitive injury or expend significant resources enforcing our intellectual property rights 

our success depends in part on our proprietary technology including technology we obtained through acquisitions we rely on various intellectual property rights including patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets as well as confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish our proprietary rights if we do not enforce our intellectual property rights successfully our competitive position may suffer which could harm our operating results 

  

our pending patent copyright and trademark registration applications may not be allowed or competitors may challenge the validity or scope of our patents copyrights or trademarks in addition our patents copyrights trademarks and other intellectual property rights may not provide us with a significant competitive advantage in preparation for the separation and distribution we have applied for trademarks related to our new global brand name in various jurisdictions worldwide any successful opposition to our applications in material jurisdictions could impose material costs on us or make it more difficult to protect our brand different jurisdictions vary widely in the level of protection and priority they give to trademark and other intellectual property rights 

we may be required to spend significant resources monitoring our intellectual property rights and we may or may not be able to detect infringement of such rights by third parties our competitive position may be harmed if we cannot detect infringement and enforce our intellectual property rights in a timely manner or at all in some circumstances we may choose to not pursue enforcement due to a variety of reasons in addition competitors may avoid infringement by designing around our intellectual property rights or by developing noninfringing competing technologies intellectual property rights and our ability to enforce them may be unavailable or limited in some countries which could make it easier for competitors to capture market share and could result in lost revenues to the company furthermore some of our intellectual property is licensed to others which allows them to compete with us using that intellectual property 

if we experience a significant cybersecurity attack or disruption in our it systems our business reputation and operating results could be adversely affected 

we rely on several centralized it systems to provide solutions and services maintain financial records retain sensitive data such as intellectual property proprietary business information and data related to customers suppliers and business partners process orders manage inventory process shipments to customers and operate other critical functions the ongoing maintenance and security of this information is pertinent to the success of our business operations and our strategic goals 

despite our implementation of network security measures our network may be vulnerable to cybersecurity attacks computer viruses breakins and similar disruptions our network security measures include but are not limited to the implementation of firewalls antivirus protection patches log monitors routine backups offsite storage network audits and routine updates and modifications despite our efforts to create these security barriers we may not be able to keep pace as new threats emerge and it is virtually impossible for us to entirely eliminate this risk cybersecurity attacks are evolving and include but are not limited to malicious software attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation operating results and financial condition and no assurance can be given that our efforts to reduce the risk of such attacks will be successful 

in addition our it systems may be susceptible to damage disruptions instability or shutdowns due to power outages hardware failures telecommunication failures user errors implementation of new operational systems or software or upgrades to existing systems and software catastrophes overburdening of systems resulting from an increase of work from home employees due to covid19 or other unforeseen events such events could result in the disruption of business processes network degradation and system downtime along with the potential that a third party will exploit our critical assets such as intellectual property proprietary business information and data related to our customers suppliers and business partners further such events could result in loss of revenue loss of or reduction in purchase orders inability to report financial information litigation regulatory fines and penalties and other damage that could have a material impact on our business operations to the extent that such disruptions occur our customers and partners may lose confidence in our solutions and we may lose business or brand reputation resulting in a material and adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

we are or will be subject to ongoing tax examinations of our tax returns by the irs and other tax authorities an adverse outcome of any such audit or examination by the irs or other tax authority could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

we are or will be subject to ongoing tax examinations of our tax returns by the irs and other tax authorities in various jurisdictions we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from ongoing tax examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes these assessments can require considerable estimates and judgments intercompany transactions associated with the sale of inventory services intellectual property and cost sharing arrangements are complex and affect our tax liabilities the calculation of our tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in multiple jurisdictions the outcomes of these tax examinations could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition due to the complexity of tax contingencies the ultimate resolution of any tax matters related to operations may result in payments greater or less than amounts accrued 

  

our operations may be adversely impacted by changes in our business mix or changes in the tax legislative landscape 

our effective tax rate may be adversely impacted by among other things changes in the mix of our earnings among countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets and changes in tax laws we cannot give any assurance as to what our effective tax rate will be in the future because among other things there is uncertainty regarding the tax policies of the jurisdictions where we operate changes in tax laws such as tax reform in the united states or changes in tax laws resulting from the organization for economic cooperation and development’s “oecd” multijurisdictional plan of action to address “base erosion and profit shifting” and the taxation of the “digital economy” could impact our effective tax rate 

if tax laws or incentives change or cease to be in effect our income taxes could increase significantly 

we are subject to federal state and local taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions we devote significant resources to evaluating our tax positions and our worldwide provision for taxes our financial results and tax treatment are susceptible to changes in tax accounting and other laws regulations principles and interpretations in the united states and in other jurisdictions where we do business with the rise of economic and political policies that favor domestic interests it is possible that more countries will enact tax laws that either increase the tax rates or reduce or change the tax incentives available to multinational companies like ours upon a change in tax laws in any territory where we do significant business we may not be able to maintain our current tax rate or qualify for or maintain the benefits of any tax incentives offered to the extent such incentives are offered 

we currently benefit from tax incentives extended to certain of our foreign subsidiaries to encourage investment or employment the most significant of which being singapore the singapore tax incentives require that specific conditions be satisfied which include achieving thresholds of employment ownership of certain assets as well as specific types of investment activities within singapore based on the current tax environment we believe that we will satisfy such conditions in the future as needed but cannot guarantee that the tax environment will not change or that such conditions will be satisfied 

our singapore tax incentives are due for renewal in fiscal 2024 but we cannot guarantee that singapore will not revoke the tax incentives earlier our taxes could increase if the existing singapore incentives are not renewed upon revocation or expiration we cannot guarantee that we will qualify for any new incentive regime that may exist in fiscal 2024 or that such conditions will be satisfied if we cannot or do not wish to satisfy all or portions of the tax incentives conditions we may lose the related tax incentives and could be required to refund the benefits that the tax incentives previously provided as a result our effective tax rate could be higher than it would have been had we maintained the benefits of the tax incentives and could harm our operating results 

our business will suffer if we are not able to retain and hire key personnel 

our future success depends partly on the continued service of our key research engineering sales marketing manufacturing executive and administrative personnel including personnel joining our company through acquisitions the markets in which we operate are dynamic and we may need to respond with reorganizations workforce reductions and site closures from time to time we believe our pay levels are competitive within the regions that we operate however there is also intense competition for certain highly technical specialties in geographic areas in which we operate and it may become more difficult to retain key employees if we fail to retain and hire a sufficient number of these personnel we may not be able to meet key objectives such as launching effective product innovations and meeting financial goals and maintain or expand our business 

if we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with certain regulations we may be subject to substantial negative financial consequences and civil or criminal penalties 

we and our customers are subject to various significant international federal state and local regulations including but not limited to health and safety including regulations related to covid19 packaging data privacy product content environmental labor and importexport regulations these regulations are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time we may be required to incur significant expenses to comply with these regulations or to remedy violations of these regulations any failure by us to comply with applicable government regulations could also result in cessation of our operations or portions of our operations high financial penalties product recalls or impositions of fines and restrictions on our ability to carry on or expand our operations if demand for our solutions is adversely affected or our costs increase our business would suffer 

our rd manufacturing and distribution operations involve the use of hazardous substances and are regulated under international federal state and local laws governing health and safety and the environment we are also regulated under a number of international federal state and local laws regarding recycling product packaging and product content requirements we apply strict standards for protection of the environment and occupational health and safety inside and outside the united states even where not subject to regulation imposed by foreign governments we believe that our properties and operations at our facilities 

  

comply in all material respects with applicable environmental and occupational health and safety laws in spite of these efforts no assurance can be given that we will be compliant with all applicable environmental and workplace health and safety laws and regulations and violations could result in civil or criminal sanctions fines and penalties 

we have developed internal data handling policies and practices to comply with the general data protection regulation “gdpr” in the european union and data privacy regulations similar to gdpr in other jurisdictions our existing business strategy does not rely on aggregating or selling personally identifiable information and as a general matter keysight does not process personally identifiable information on behalf of our customers we devote resources to keep up with the changing regulatory environment on data privacy in the jurisdictions where we do business despite our efforts no assurance can be given that we will be compliant with data privacy regulations new laws amendments or interpretations of regulations industry standards and contractual obligations relating to data privacy may require us to incur additional costs and restrict our business operations if we fail to comply with gdpr or other data privacy regulation we may be subject to significant financial fines and civil or criminal penalties and may suffer damage to our reputation or brand which could adversely affect our business and financial results 

in addition our products and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies like the international standards organization as well as regulation by other agencies such as the us federal communications commission we also must comply with work safety rules if we fail to adequately address any of these regulations our businesses could be harmed 

failure to comply with anticorruption laws could adversely affect our business and result in financial penalties 

because we have extensive international operations we must comply with complex foreign and us laws and regulations such as the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials and anticompetition regulations although we actively maintain policies and procedures designed to ensure ongoing compliance with these laws and regulations there can be no assurance that our employees contractors or agents will not violate these policies and procedures violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties criminal sanctions restrictions on our business conduct and on our ability to offer our solutions in one or more countries and could also materially affect our brand ability to attract and retain employees international operations business and operating results 

our business and financial results may be adversely affected by various legal and regulatory proceedings 

we are subject to legal proceedings lawsuits and other claims in the normal course of business and could become subject to additional claims in the future some of which could be material the outcome of existing proceedings lawsuits and claims may differ from our expectations because the outcomes of litigation are often difficult to reliably predict various factors or developments can lead us to change current estimates of liabilities and related insurance receivables where applicable or permit us to make such estimates for matters previously not susceptible to reasonable estimates such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment a significant settlement significant regulatory developments or changes in applicable law a future adverse ruling settlement or unfavorable development could result in charges that could adversely affect our business operating results or financial condition 

our internal controls may be determined to be ineffective which may adversely affect investor confidence in our company the value of our stock and our access to capital 

the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 requires us to furnish a report by management on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting among other things we are devoting significant resources and time to comply with such internal control over financial reporting requirements however we cannot be certain that these measures will ensure that we design implement and maintain adequate control over our financial processes and reporting in the future especially in the context of acquisitions of other businesses any difficulties in the assimilation of acquired businesses into our control system could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations inferior internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our stock or on our access to capital or cause us to be subject to investigation or sanctions by the sec 

adverse conditions in the global banking industry and credit markets may adversely impact the value of our cash investments or impair our liquidity 

our cash and cash equivalents are invested or held in a mix of money market funds time deposit accounts and bank demand deposit accounts disruptions in the financial markets may in some cases result in an inability to access assets such as money market funds that traditionally have been viewed as highly liquid any failure of our counterparty financial institutions or funds in which we have invested may adversely impact our cash and cash equivalent positions and in turn our results and financial condition 

  

future investment returns on pension assets may be lower than expected or interest rates may decline requiring us to make significant additional cash contributions to our future plans 

we sponsor several defined benefit pension plans that cover many of our salaried and hourly employees the federal pension protection act of 2006 requires that certain capitalization levels be maintained in each of the us plans and there may be similar funding requirements in the plans outside the united states because it is unknown what the investment return on and the fair value of our pension assets will be in future years or what interest rates and discount rates may be at any point in time no assurances can be given that applicable law will not require us to make future material plan contributions any such contributions could adversely affect our financial condition 

environmental contamination from past operations could subject us to unreimbursed costs and could harm onsite operations and the future use and value of the properties involved and environmental contamination caused by ongoing operations could subject us to substantial liabilities in the future 

some of our properties are undergoing remediation by hp inc hp for subsurface contaminations that were known at the time of agilents separation from hp in 1999 in connection with agilents separation from hp hp and agilent entered into an agreement pursuant to which hp agreed to retain the liability for this subsurface contamination perform the required remediation and indemnify agilent with respect to claims arising out of that contamination agilent has assigned its rights and obligations under this agreement to keysight in respect of facilities transferred to us in the separation as a result hp will have access to a limited number of our properties to perform remediation although hp agreed to minimize interference with onsite operations at such properties remediation activities and subsurface contamination may require us to incur unreimbursed costs and could harm onsite operations and the future use and value of the properties in connection with the separation agilent will indemnify us directly for any liabilities related thereto we cannot be sure that hp will continue to fulfill its remediation obligations or that agilent will continue to fulfill its indemnification obligations 

in connection with the separation from agilent agilent also agreed to indemnify us for any liability associated with contamination from past operations at all properties transferred from agilent to keysight we cannot be sure that agilent will fulfill its indemnification obligations 

our current manufacturing processes involve the use of substances regulated under various international federal state and local laws governing the environment as a result we may become subject to liabilities for environmental contamination and these liabilities may be substantial although our policy is to apply strict standards for environmental protection at our sites inside and outside the united states even if the sites outside the united states are not subject to regulations imposed by foreign governments we may not be aware of all conditions that could subject us to liability 

risks related to our common stock 

our share price may fluctuate significantly 

our common stock is listed on new york stock exchange nyse under the ticker symbol “keys” the market price of our common stock may fluctuate widely depending on many factors some of which may be beyond our control including but not limited to 



  

 stock markets in general have experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company these broad market fluctuations could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 

in addition when the market price of a company’s shares drops significantly shareholders often institute securities class action lawsuits against the company a lawsuit against us could cause us to incur substantial costs and could divert the time and attention of management and other resources 

we do not currently pay dividends on our common stock 

we do not currently pay dividends on our common stock the payment of any dividends in the future and the timing and amount thereof to our stockholders fall within the discretion of our board of directors the boards decisions regarding the payment of dividends will depend on many factors such as our financial condition earnings capital requirements debt service obligations restrictive covenants in our debt industry practice legal requirements regulatory constraints and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant we cannot guarantee that we will pay a dividend in the future or continue to pay any dividends if we commence paying dividends 

certain provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and of delaware law may prevent or delay an acquisition of the company which could decrease the trading price of our common stock 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain and delaware law contains provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by making such practices or bids unacceptably expensive to the bidder and to encourage prospective acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover these provisions include but are not limited to 



  

in addition because we have not chosen to be exempt from section 203 of the delaware general corporation law the dgcl this provision could also delay or prevent a change of control that some shareholders may favor section 203 provides that subject to limited exceptions persons that acquire or are affiliated with a person that acquires more than 15 percent of the outstanding voting stock of a delaware corporation an interested stockholder shall not engage in any business combination with that corporation including by merger consolidation or acquisitions of additional shares for a threeyear period following the date on which the person became an interested stockholder unless i prior to such time the board of directors of such corporation approved either the business combination or the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder ii upon consummation of the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder the interested stockholder owned at least 85 percent of the voting stock of such corporation at the time the transaction commenced excluding for purposes of determining the voting stock outstanding but not the outstanding voting stock owned by the interested stockholder the voting stock owned by directors who are also officers or held in employee benefit plans in which the employees do not have a confidential right to tender or vote stock held by the plan or iii on or subsequent to such time the business combination is approved by the board of directors of such corporation and authorized at a meeting of shareholders by the affirmative vote of at least twothirds of the outstanding voting stock of such corporation not owned by the interested stockholder 

we believe these provisions will protect our shareholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors and by providing our board of directors with more time to assess any acquisition proposal these provisions are not intended to make us immune from takeovers however these provisions will apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some shareholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that our board of directors determines is not in the best interests of the company and our shareholders these provisions may also prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates that the state courts in the state of delaware or if no state court located within the state of delaware has jurisdiction the federal court for the district of delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our shareholders which could discourage lawsuits against the company and our directors and officers 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provide that unless the board of directors otherwise determines the state courts in the state of delaware or if no state court located within the state of delaware has jurisdiction the federal court for the district of delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors or officers to the company or our shareholders any action asserting a claim against us or any of our directors or officers arising pursuant to any provision of the dgcl or keysights amended and restated certificate of incorporation or bylaws or any action asserting a claim against us or any of our directors or officers governed by the internal affairs doctrine this exclusive forum provision may limit the ability of our shareholders to bring a claim in a judicial forum that such shareholders find favorable for disputes with us or our directors or officers which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors and officers

overview and executive summary 

keysight technologies inc we us keysight or the company incorporated in delaware on december 6 2013 is a technology company that helps enterprises service providers and governments accelerate innovation to connect and secure the world by providing electronic design and test solutions that are used in the simulation design validation manufacture installation optimization and secure operation of electronics systems in the communications networking and electronics industries we also offer customization consulting and optimization services throughout the customers product lifecycle including startup assistance asset management uptime services application services and instrument calibration and repair 

our fiscal year end is october 31 unless otherwise stated all years and dates refer to our fiscal year 

we completed an organizational change in 2020 to manage our former ixia solutions group within our communications solutions group to enable us to create improved goto market and product development alignment as well as accelerate solution synergies as new technologies emerge as a result of this organizational change we now have two reportable operating segments the communications solutions group and the electronic industrial solutions group prior period segment results were revised to conform to the current presentation 

impact of covid19 pandemic and outlook 

in march 2020 the world health organization declared covid19 as a global pandemic in response to the rapid global spread of the virus national state and local governments issued orders and recommendations to attempt to reduce the further spread of the disease such orders included movement control and shelterinplace orders travel restrictions limitations on public gatherings school closures social distancing requirements and the closure of all but critical and essential services and infrastructure in response to these measures and to protect the health and safety of our employees we temporarily closed our locations globally including our production and order fulfillment facilities asked all employees who can work from home to do so for the foreseeable future made substantial changes to employee travel policies and canceled training and marketing events or moved them to a virtual format our customers suppliers and vendors have been subject to these restrictions and orders and have been similarly impacted fluctuation in infection rates in the regions in which we operate have resulted in periodic changes in restrictions that vary from region to region and require vigilant attention and rapid response to new or reinstated restrictions 

working with local governments and health officials to implement health and safety measures at all of our locations we have reopened many sites worldwide and significantly ramped our production and services operations despite the ongoing broader industry supply chain challenges we have restarted onsite operations using only employees who are not able to work effectively from home and where doing so is in compliance with local regulations and our covid19 safety procedures we continue to make significant investment in research and development rd and have taken necessary steps to sustain employee productivity and deliver on our customer commitments particularly those who provide essential services and support the communities in which we operate around the world also given the uncertainty of the duration or severity of the pandemic we took proactive measures to reduce costs and preserve liquidity while supporting our customers and advancing key projects these measures included a temporary hiring freeze and a reduction in other discretionary spending along with reductions in variable compensation and outsourced manufacturing costs enabled by our flexible cost structure 

  

our revenue for 2020 was lower when compared to 2019 due to site closures and supply chain disruptions resulting from the temporary shutdown of our production facilities related to the covid19 pandemic the impact of lower revenue on gross margin and operating margin was more than offset by favorable mix and lower discretionary spending as a result of our mitigation efforts we continue to see steady demand across several end markets with ongoing investment in nextgeneration technologies such as 5g 400g and advanced semiconductor node processes while demand decreased in other markets such as automotive and energy 

our strategy of bringing firsttomarket solutions that help customers develop new technologies and accelerate innovation provides a platform for longterm growth we expect our customers to continue to make rd investments in certain nextgeneration technologies we are still in the early market stages for emerging technologies such as 5g nextgeneration automotive internet of things iot and defense modernization and expect technology investments to continue we continue to closely monitor the current macro environment related to trade tariffs monetary and fiscal policies as well as pandemics or epidemics such as the recent covid19 outbreak we have complied and will continue to comply with recent us department of commerce export control regulations while we expect ongoing covid19 demand and supply chain headwinds over the next few quarters we remain confident in our longterm secular market growth trends and the strength of our operating model

currency exchange rate exposure 

our revenues costs and expenses and monetary assets and liabilities are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our global operating and financing activities we hedge revenues expenses and balance sheet exposures that are not denominated in the functional currencies of our subsidiaries on a shortterm and anticipated basis the result of the hedging has been included in our consolidated statement of operations we experience some fluctuations within individual lines of the consolidated balance sheet and consolidated statement of operations because our hedging program is not designed to offset the currency movements in each category of revenues expenses monetary assets and liabilities our hedging program is designed to hedge shortterm currency movements based on a rolling period of up to twelve months therefore we are exposed to currency fluctuations over the longer term to the extent that we are required to pay for all or portions of an acquisition price in foreign currencies we may enter into foreign exchange contracts to reduce the risk that currency movements will impact the us dollar cost of the transaction

costs and expenses 





gross margin increased 1 percentage point in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily driven by favorable mix and lower variable compensation partially offset by lower revenue volume due to the impact of site closures and supply chain disruptions gross margin increased 5 percentage points in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily driven by higher revenue volume highly differentiated solutions favorable mix and a decline in warranty costs 

excess and obsolete inventory charges were 29 million in 2020 27 million in 2019 and 25 million in 2018 sales of previously writtendown inventory were 2 million in each of 2020 2019 and 2018 

research and development expense increased 4 percent in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily driven by greater investments in key growth opportunities in our end markets and leadingedge technologies and incremental costs of acquired businesses partially offset by declines in variable compensation and a reduction in discretionary spending due to covid19 related restrictions research and development expense increased 10 percent in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily driven by greater investments in key growth opportunities in our end markets leadingedge technologies people and infrastructure research and development expense as a percent of total revenue was 17 percent in 2020 and 16 percent in each of 2019 and 2018 

selling general and administrative expenses decreased 5 percent in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily driven by declines in travel and marketingrelated costs due to covid19 related restrictions and variable and other peoplerelated costs partially offset by incremental costs of acquired businesses selling general and administrative expenses decreased 4 percent in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily driven by declines in litigation restructuring and acquisition and integration costs partially offset by an increase in peoplerelated costs

operating margin increased 2 percentage points in 2020 when compared to 2019 primarily driven by favorable revenue mix declines in travel and marketingrelated costs due to covid19 related restrictions and variable compensation partially offset 

  

by lower revenue volume operating margin increased 27 percentage points in 2019 when compared to 2018 primarily driven by a nonrecurring goodwill impairment charge in 2018 higher revenue volume highly differentiated solutions favorable mix lower acquisition and integration costs and lower litigation and restructuringrelated costs partially offset by an increase in peoplerelated costs 

our headcount was approximately 13900 at october 31 2020 compared to 13600 at october 31 2019 the increase in headcount was primarily driven by acquisitions

income taxes 



for 2020 the effective tax rate was 18 percent which is lower than the us statutory rate primarily due to a higher percentage of earnings in the nonus jurisdictions taxed at lower statutory tax rates 

for 2019 the effective tax rate was 13 percent which is lower than the us statutory rate primarily due to a higher percentage of earnings in the nonus jurisdictions taxed at lower statutory tax rates the increase in the effective tax rate from 2019 to 2020 is primarily due to a onetime rate benefit from a release of tax reserves in 2019 and an increase in 2020 of taxes in nonus jurisdictions due to acquired entity integration offset by a decrease in us taxes on nonus earnings 

for 2018 the effective tax rate was 140 percent which is higher than the us statutory rate primarily due to the net impact of us tax law changes the singapore restructuring and tax incentive modifications completed in 2018 in response to singapore tax law changes and the tax impact of goodwill impairment 

keysight benefits from tax incentives in several jurisdictions most significantly in singapore that have granted us tax incentives that require renewal at various times in the future the tax incentives provide lower rates of taxation on certain classes of income and require thresholds of investments and employment or specific types of income in those jurisdictions the singapore tax incentives are due for renewal in 2024 the incentive in malaysia was due for renewal in 2020 for the period from 2021 to 2025 keysight has received confirmation from the malaysian investment development authority that this incentive will be renewed for the period from 2021 to 2025 the impact of the tax incentives decreased income taxes by 53 million 47 million and 567 million in 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively the decrease in the tax benefit from 2018 to 2019 is primarily due to the onetime impacts of the singapore restructuring and tax incentive modifications that were completed in 2018 in response to singapore tax law changes 

the calculation of our tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex tax law and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions although the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes the use of a recognition and measurement model the determination of whether an uncertain tax position has met those thresholds will continue to require significant judgment by management in accordance with the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes for all us and other tax jurisdictions we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes and interest will be due the ultimate resolution of tax uncertainties may differ from what is currently estimated which could result in a material impact on income tax expense if our estimate of income tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment a further charge to expense would be required if the payment of these additional amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the 

  

period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary we include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes in the consolidated statements of operations accrued interest and penalties are included on the related tax liability line in the consolidated balance sheet 

the open tax years for the irs and most states are from november 1 2015 through the current tax year keysight’s 2018 us federal income tax return is currently under audit by the irs this is the year in which the tax cuts and jobs act was enacted and the onetime us tax on earnings not previously repatriated to the us known as the transition tax was reported for the majority of our foreign entities the open tax years are from november 1 2015 through the current tax year for certain foreign entities the tax years remain open at most back to the year 2008 given the number of years and numerous matters that remain subject to examination in various tax jurisdictions we are unable to estimate the range of possible changes to the balance of our unrecognized tax benefits 

the company is being audited in malaysia for the 2008 tax year this tax year predates our separation from agilent the separation however pursuant to the agreement between agilent and keysight pertaining to tax matters as finalized at the time of the separation for certain entities including malaysia any historical tax liability is the responsibility of keysight in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 keysight paid income taxes and penalties of 68 million on gains related to intellectual property rights our appeal to the special commissioners of income tax in malaysia was unsuccessful an appeal has now been lodged with the high court of malaysia the company believes there are numerous defenses to the current assessment the statute of limitations for the 2008 tax year in malaysia was closed and the income in question is exempt from tax in malaysia the company is disputing this assessment and pursuing all avenues to resolve this issue favorably for the company

although recent disruption and volatility in global capital markets due to the ongoing covid19 pandemic has not had a significant impact on our financial position liquidity and ability to meet our debt covenants we continue to monitor the capital markets and general global economic conditions given the uncertainty of the duration or severity of the pandemic we have taken proactive measures to reduce costs and preserve liquidity while supporting our customers and advancing key projects these measures include a temporary hiring freeze and other discretionary spending along with lower variable compensation and a reduction in outsourced manufacturing costs enabled by our flexible cost structure 

our liquidity is affected by many factors some of which are based on normal ongoing operations of our business and some of which arise from fluctuations related to global economics and markets our cash balances are generated and held in many locations throughout the world local government regulations may restrict our ability to move cash balances to meet cash needs under certain circumstances we do not currently expect such regulations and restrictions to impact our ability to pay vendors and conduct operations throughout our global organization 

we believe our cash and cash equivalents cash generated from operations and ability to access capital markets and credit lines will satisfy for at least the next twelve months our liquidity requirements both globally and domestically including the following working capital needs capital expenditures business acquisitions contractual obligations commitments principal and interest payments on debt and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations cash generated from our operations provides our primary source of cash flows in addition we utilized certain provisions of the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act “cares act” which was enacted by the us government to provide additional shortterm liquidity including relief from employer payroll tax remittance and expect to continue utilizing these benefits through calendar year 2020 given the uncertain duration and severity of the covid19 pandemic we could experience significant fluctuations in our future cash from operations from the ongoing impacts of the pandemic because of the adverse global macroeconomic environment and our customers ability to pay for further discussion of risks related to the covid19 pandemic on our operations business results and financial condition see “item 1a risk factors”

our cash flows from operations are dependent on a number of factors including fluctuations in our operating results accounts receivable collections inventory management and the timing of tax and other payments as a result the impact of contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be analyzed in conjunction with such factors 

the following table summarizes our total contractual obligations at october 31 2020 the amounts presented in the table do not reflect 144 million of liabilities for uncertain tax positions as of october 31 2020 we are unable to accurately predict when these amounts will be realized or released however it is reasonably possible that there could be significant changes to our unrecognized tax benefits in the next twelve months due to either the expiration of a statute of limitations or a tax audit settlement 



interest on senior notes we have contractual obligations for interest payments on our senior notes interest rates and payment dates are detailed above under longterm debt 

operating leases commitments under operating leases primarily relates to leasehold property see note 16 leases for additional information 

commitments to contract manufacturers and suppliers we purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products during the normal course of business we issue purchase orders with estimates of our requirements several months ahead of the delivery datesthe reported open purchase orders represent a commitment to our suppliers our agreements with suppliers for common materials provide us the option to cancel reschedule and adjust our requirements based on business needs we expect to fulfill most of our purchase commitments for inventory within one year or based on mutually agreed terms 

as of october 31 2020 the noncancellable purchase commitments aggregate to approximately 291 million of which the majority is for less than one year 

in addition to the commitments to contract manufacturers and suppliers referenced above we record a liability for firm noncancellable purchase commitments for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with our policy relating to excess inventory the liability for our excess firm noncancellable purchase commitments was 21 million as of both october 31 2020 and 2019 these amounts are included in other accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet 

retirement plans commitments under the retirement plans relate to expected contributions to be made to our nonus defined benefit plans for the next year only contributions beyond the next year are impractical to estimate 

we also have benefit payments due under our defined benefit retirement plans and postretirement benefit plan that are not required to be funded in advance but are paid in the same period that benefits are provided see item 8financial statements and supplementary data note 15 retirement plans and postretirement benefit plans for additional information 

  

us transition tax liability the obligation for the us transition tax liability included in other longterm liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet relates to the onetime us tax on those earnings that have not been previously repatriated to the us the “transition tax” keysight has elected to pay the transition tax over 8 years see item 7 managements discussion and analysis “income taxes” for additional information on the transition tax 

employer payroll tax liability we utilized certain provisions of cares act and deferred remittance of payroll taxes of approximately 21 million included in other longterm liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet we further expect to defer approximately 6 million through december 2020 

other purchase commitments other purchase commitments relate to contracts with professional services suppliers we can typically cancel these contracts within 90 days without penalties for those contracts that are not cancellable within 90 days without penalties we disclose the amounts we are obligated to pay to a supplier under each contract in that period before such contract can be canceled as of october 31 2020  our contractual obligations with these suppliers was approximately 52 million within the next fiscal year as compared to approximately 69 million as of october 31 2019 

off balance sheet arrangements and other 

as of october 31 2020 we had no material offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of regulation sk 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable although these estimates are based on managements best knowledge of current events and actions that may impact the company in the future actual results may be different from the estimates due to the covid19 pandemic there has been uncertainty and disruption in the global economy and our markets we are not aware of any specific event or circumstance that would require an update to our estimates or judgments or a revision of the carrying value of our assets or liabilities as of october 31 2020 an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur could materially change the financial statements our critical accounting policies are those that affect our financial statements materially and involve difficult subjective or complex judgments by management those policies are revenue recognition inventory valuation sharebased compensation retirement and postretirement plan assumptions valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets warranty loss contingencies restructuring and accounting for income taxes 

revenue recognition revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of the promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services we primarily generate revenue from the sale of products hardware andor software services or a combination thereof we enter into contracts that may involve multiple performance obligations and we allocate the transaction price between each performance obligation on the basis of relative standalone selling price “ssp” we recognize revenue following the fivestep model 



  

transaction price including rebates rights of return tradein credits and discounts variable consideration is generally accounted for at the portfolio level and estimated based on historical information 

 inventory valuation we assess the valuation of our inventory on a periodic basis and make adjustments to the value for estimated excess and obsolete inventory based upon estimates about future demand and actual usage such estimates are difficult to make under most economic conditions the excess balance determined by this analysis becomes the basis for our excess inventory charge our excess inventory review process includes analysis of sales forecasts managing product rollovers and working with manufacturing to maximize recovery of excess inventory if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management additional writedowns may be required if actual market conditions are more favorable than anticipated inventory previously written down may be sold to customers resulting in lower cost of sales and higher income from operations than expected in that period 

sharebased compensation we account for sharebased awards in accordance with the provisions of the authoritative accounting guidance which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all sharebased payment awards made to our employees and directors the fair value of sharebased awards for employee stock option awards was estimated using the blackscholes option pricing model awards granted under the keysight technologies inc longterm performance ltp program are based on a variety of targets such as total shareholder return tsr or financial metrics such as operating margin cost synergies and others the awards based on tsr were valued using a monte carlo simulation model and those based on financial metrics were valued based on the market price of keysight’s common stock on the date of grant the compensation cost for financial metricsbased performance awards reflect the cost of awards that are probable to vest at the end of the performance period both the blackscholes and monte carlo simulation fair value models require the use of highly subjective and complex assumptions including the option’s expected life and the price volatility of the underlying stock the estimated fair value of restricted stock awards is determined based on the market price of keysight’s common stock on the date of grant we did not grant any option awards in 2020 2019 and 2018 

retirement and postretirement benefit plan assumptions   retirement and postretirement benefit plan costs are a significant cost of doing business they represent obligations that will ultimately be settled sometime in the future and therefore are subject to estimation defined benefit plan obligations are remeasured at least annually as of october 31 based on the present value of future benefit payments to reflect the future benefit costs over the employees average expected future service to keysight based on the terms of the plans to estimate the present value of these future payments we are required to make assumptions using actuarial concepts within the framework of gaap two critical assumptions are the discount rate and the expected longterm return on plan assets other important assumptions include expected future salary increases expected future increases to benefit payments expected retirement dates employee turnover retiree mortality rates and investment portfolio composition we evaluate these assumptions at least annually see note 15 retirement plans and postretirement benefit plans 

the discount rate is used to determine the present value of future benefit payments at the measurement date which is october 31 for both us and nonus plans the us discount rates as of october 31 2020 and 2019 were determined based on the results 

  

of matching expected plan benefit payments with cash flows from a hypothetically constructed bond portfolio the nonus discount rates as of october 31 2020 and 2019 were determined using spot rates along the yield curve to calculate disaggregated discount rates in addition we used this method to calculate two components of the periodic benefit cost service cost and interest cost if we changed our discount rate by 1 percent the impact would be 9 million on us net periodic benefit cost and 14 million on nonus net periodic benefit cost lower discount rates increase the present value of the liability and subsequent year pension expense higher discount rates decrease the present value of the liability and subsequent year pension expense 

the company uses alternate methods of amortization as allowed by the authoritative guidance that amortizes the actuarial gains and losses on a consistent basis for the years presented for us plans gains and losses are amortized over the average future working lifetime for most nonus plans and us postretirement benefit plans gains and losses are amortized using a separate layer for each years gains and losses the expected longterm return on plan assets is estimated using current and expected asset allocations as well as historical and expected returns plan assets are valued at fair value if we changed our estimated return on assets by 1 percent the impact would be 8 million on us net periodic benefit cost and 15 million on nonus net periodic benefit cost 

goodwill and other intangible assets we review goodwill for impairment annually during our fourth fiscal quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable as defined in the authoritative guidance a reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment at the time of an acquisition we assign goodwill to the reporting unit that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination 

companies have the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether performing a quantitative test is necessary if an entity believes as a result of its qualitative assessment that it is morelikelythannot that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount the quantitative impairment test will be required otherwise no further testing will be required 

the quantitative impairment test involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount including goodwill we determine the fair value of a reporting unit using the results derived using the market approach when available and appropriate or the income approach or a combination of both if multiple valuation methodologies are used the results are weighted accordingly the income approach is estimated through the discounted cash flow “dcf” analysis determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgment including judgments about appropriate discount rates revenue growth rates and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows discount rates are based on a weighted average cost of capital “wacc” which represents the average rate a business must pay its providers of debt and equity plus a risk premium the wacc used to test goodwill is derived from a group of comparable companies the cash flows employed in the dcf analysis are derived from internal forecasts and external market forecasts the market approach estimates the fair value of the reporting unit by utilizing the market comparable method which is based on revenue and earnings multiples from comparable companies if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value then an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting units fair value up to a maximum amount of the goodwill balance for the reporting unit 

in 2020 we performed our annual impairment test of goodwill for all our reporting units using a qualitative approach based on the results of our qualitative testing we believe that it is morelikelythannot that the fair value of each reporting unit is greater than its respective carrying value in 2019 we performed our annual impairment test for all our reporting units based on the results of our testing the fair value of each of our reporting units exceeded the carrying value in 2018 we recorded impairment losses of 709 million for our former ixia solutions group see note 11 goodwill and other intangible assets to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

other intangible assets consist primarily of developed technologies proprietary knowhow trademarks customer relationships noncompete agreements and backlog and are amortized using the straightline method over estimated useful lives ranging from 6 months to 10 years we review other intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of these assets are no longer appropriate no impairments of purchased intangible assets were recorded during the years ended october 31 2020 2019 and 2018 

we review indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of these assets are no longer appropriate the authoritative accounting guidance allows a qualitative approach for testing indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment similar to the impairment testing guidance for goodwill it allows the option to first assess qualitative factors events and circumstances that could have affected the significant inputs used in determining the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset the qualitative factors assist in determining whether it is morelikelythannot that the indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired an organization may choose to bypass the qualitative assessment for any indefinitelived intangible asset in any period 

  

and proceed directly to calculating its fair value our indefinitelived intangible assets are inprocess research and development iprd intangible assets in 2020 2019 and 2018 we assessed impairment by performing a qualitative test no impairment of indefinitelived intangible assets was recorded in 2020 and 2019 in 2018 we recorded impairment charges of 5 million related to cancellations of iprd projects 

warranty keysight warranties on products sold through direct sales channels are primarily for one year warranties for products sold through distribution channels are primarily for three years we accrue for standard warranty costs based on historical trends in warranty charges the accrual is reviewed regularly and periodically adjusted to reflect changes in warranty cost estimates estimated warranty charges are recorded within cost of products at the time related product revenue is recognized 

we also sell extended warranties that provide warranty coverage beyond the standard warranty term revenue associated with extended warranties is deferred and recognized over the extended coverage period 

loss contingencies as discussed in note 17 and 18 to the consolidated financial statements we are from time to time subject to a variety of litigation and similar contingent liabilities incidental to our business or the business operations of previously owned entities we recognize a liability for any contingency that is known or probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable these assessments require judgments concerning matters such as litigation developments and outcomes the anticipated outcome of negotiations the number of future claims and the cost of both pending and future claims in addition because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time liabilities may change in the future due to various factors changes in these factors could materially impact our financial position or our results of operation 

restructuring the main component of our restructuring plan is related to workforce reductions and site restructuring workforce reduction charges are accrued when payment of benefits becomes probable and the amounts can be estimated if the amounts and timing of cash flows from restructuring activities are significantly different from what we have estimated the actual amount of restructuring and other related charges could be materially different either higher or lower than those we have recorded 

accounting for income taxes we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits benefits and deductions and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities that arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes as well as interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period 

significant management judgment is also required in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part when it is morelikelythannot that all or some portion of specific deferred tax assets such as net operating losses or foreign tax credit carryforwards will not be realized a valuation allowance must be established for the amount of the deferred tax assets that cannot be realized we consider all available positive and negative evidence on a jurisdictionbyjurisdiction basis when assessing whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable we consider evidence such as our past operating results the existence of losses in recent years and our forecast of future taxable income at october 31 2020 the company maintains a valuation allowance mainly related to net operating losses in luxembourg netherlands and the uk capital losses in the uk and california research credits we intend to maintain a valuation allowance in these jurisdictions until sufficient positive evidence exists to support their reversal 

the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax law and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions although the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes the use of a recognition and measurement model the determination of whether an uncertain tax position has met those thresholds will continue to require significant judgment by management in accordance with the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes for all us and other tax jurisdictions we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes and interest will be due the ultimate resolution of tax uncertainties may differ from what is currently estimated which could result in a material impact on income tax expense if our estimate of income tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment a further charge to expense would be required if events occur and the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary we include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes in the consolidated statements of operations

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

at various times we use derivative financial instruments to limit exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates because derivative instruments are used solely as hedges and not for speculative trading purposes fluctuations in the market values of such derivative instruments are generally offset by reciprocal changes in the underlying economic exposures that the instruments are intended to hedge for further discussion of derivative financial instruments see note 14 derivatives 

currency exchange rate risk 

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks inherent in our sales commitments anticipated sales expenses and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries we hedge future cash flows denominated in currencies other than the functional currency using sales and expense forecasts on a rolling period of up to twelve months our exposure to exchange rate risks is managed on an enterprisewide basis this strategy utilizes derivative financial instruments primarily forward contracts to hedge certain foreign currency exposures with the intent of offsetting gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposures with gains and losses on the derivative contracts hedging them we do not currently and do not intend to utilize derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes to the extent that we are required to pay for all or portions of an acquisition price in foreign currencies we may enter into foreign exchange contracts to reduce the risk that currency movements will impact the cost of the transaction 

our operations generate nonfunctional currency cash flows such as revenue thirdparty vendor payments and intercompany payments in anticipation of these foreign currency cash flows and in view of the volatility of the currency market we enter into such foreign exchange contracts as described above to substantially mitigate our currency risk in 2020 2019 and 2018 approximately 76 percent 74 percent and 76 percent of our revenues were generated in us dollars 

the unfavorable effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates principally as a result of the strength of the us dollar has an immaterial on our revenue in the year ended october 31 2020 we calculate the impact of foreign currency exchange rates movements by applying the actual foreign currency exchange rates in effect during the last month of each quarter to the current year to both the applicable current and prior year periods we also performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10 percent adverse movement in foreign exchange rates to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above as of october 31 2020 and 2019 the analysis indicated that these hypothetical market movements would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

interest rate risk 

a change in interest rates on longterm debt impacts the fair value of the company’s fixedrate longterm debt but not the company’s earnings or cash flow because the interest on such debt is fixed generally the fair market value of fixedrate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 

as of october 31 2020 a hypothetical 10 percent increase in interest rates would have decreased the fair value of the company’s fixedrate longterm debt by approximately 18 million however since the company currently has no plans to repurchase its outstanding fixedrate instruments before their maturity nor do the investors in our fixedrate debt obligations have the right to demand we pay off these obligations prior to maturity the impact of market interest rate fluctuations on the company’s fixedrate longterm debt does not affect the company’s results of operations or stockholders’ equity

backlog 

backlog represents the amount of revenue expected from orders that have already been booked including orders for goods and services that have not been delivered to customers orders invoiced but not yet recognized as revenue and orders for goods that were shipped but not invoiced awaiting acceptance by customers andor completion of a commitment to a customer 

at october 31 2019 our unfilled backlog was approximately 1380 million as compared to approximately 1311 million at october 31 2018 our unfilled backlog as of october 31 2019 reflects the impact of the deferred revenue adjustment related to the adoption of accounting standards update 201409 revenue from contracts with customers asc 606  see note 2 new accounting pronouncements to the consolidated financial statements for additional information consistent with our strategy we are seeing an increase in solution sales which have a longer ordertorevenue conversion cycle however we expect that the majority of unfilled backlog will be recognized as revenue within six months while backlog on any particular date can be an indicator of shortterm revenue performance it is not necessarily a reliable indicator of medium or longterm revenue performance 

intellectual property 

we generate patent and other intellectual property rights covering significant inventions and other innovations in order to create a competitive advantage although we believe that our licenses patents and other intellectual property rights have value in general no single license patent or other intellectual property right is in itself material other than the keysight mark 

materials 

our manufacturing operations employ a wide variety of semiconductors electromechanical components and assemblies and raw materials such as plastic resins and sheet metal we purchase materials from thousands of suppliers on a global basis some of the parts that require custom design work are not readily available from alternate suppliers due to their unique design or the length of time necessary for design work our longterm relationships with suppliers allow us to proactively manage technology road maps and product discontinuance plans and monitor their financial health to address the potential disruption in and other risks related to our supply chain we use a number of techniques including qualifying multiple sources of supply and redesign of 

  

solutions for alternative components in addition while we generally attempt to keep our inventory at minimal levels we do purchase incremental inventory as circumstances warrant to protect the supply chain for a further discussion of risks related to the materials and components required for our operations please refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

environmental 

our rd manufacturing and distribution operations involve the use of hazardous substances and are regulated under international federal state and local laws governing health and safety and the environment we apply strict standards for protection of the environment and occupational health and safety to sites inside and outside the united states even if not subject to regulation imposed by foreign governments we believe that our properties and operations at our facilities comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and occupational health and safety laws however the risk of environmental liabilities cannot be completely eliminated and there can be no assurance that the application of environmental and health and safety laws will not require us to incur significant expenditures we are also regulated under a number of international federal state and local laws regarding recycling product packaging and product content requirements the environmental product contentdisposal and recycling laws are gradually becoming more stringent and may cause us to incur significant expenditures in the future 

some of our properties are undergoing remediation by hp inc hp for subsurface contaminations that were known at the time of agilent’s separation from hp in 1999 in connection with agilent’s separation from hp hp and agilent entered into an agreement pursuant to which hp agreed to retain the liability for this subsurface contamination perform the required remediation and indemnify agilent with respect to claims arising out of that contamination agilent has assigned its rights and obligations under this agreement to keysight in respect of facilities transferred to keysight in our separation from agilent on november 1 2014 the separation as a result hp has access to a limited number of our properties to perform remediation although hp agreed to minimize interference with onsite operations at such properties remediation activities and subsurface contamination may require us to incur unreimbursed costs and could harm onsite operations and the future use and value of the properties in connection with the separation agilent will indemnify us directly for any liabilities related thereto we cannot be sure that hp will continue to fulfill its remediation obligations or that agilent will continue to fulfill its indemnification obligations 

in connection with the separation agilent also agreed to indemnify us for any liability associated with contamination from past operations at all properties transferred from agilent to us we cannot be sure that agilent will fulfill its indemnification obligations 

we maintain a comprehensive environmental site liability insurance policy that may cover certain cleanup costs or legal claims related to environmental contamination this policy covers specified active inactive and divested locations 

acquisition of material assets 

on april 18 2017 pursuant to the terms of an agreement and plan of merger dated january 30 2017 between keysight and ixia the merger agreement we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of ixia for 1622 million net of 72 million of cash acquired pursuant to an exchange offer for 1965 per share the merger consideration

 item 1a risk factors 

risks uncertainties and other factors that may affect future results 

risks related to our business 

failure to introduce successful new solutions and services in a timely manner to address increased competition rapid technological changes and changing industry standards could result in our solutions and services becoming obsolete 

we generally sell our solutions in industries that are characterized by increased competition through frequent new solution and service introductions rapid technological changes and changing industry standards in addition many of the markets in which we operate are seasonal and cyclical without the timely introduction of new solutions services and enhancements our solutions and services will become technologically obsolete over time in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer our ability to offer new solutions and services and to deploy them in a timely manner depend on several factors including but not limited to our ability to 

 our future operating results may fluctuate significantly if our investments in innovative technologies are not as profitable as we anticipate 

on a regular basis we review the existing technologies available in the market and identify strategic new technologies to develop and invest in we are currently devoting significant resources to the 5g technology and other new technologies in the automotive battery internet of things and mobile industries we are investing in rd developing relationships with customers and suppliers and redirecting our corporate and operational resources to grow within these innovative technologies our income could be harmed if we fail to gain sufficient market share if demand for our solutions is lower than we expect or if our income related to the innovative technologies is lower than we anticipate for example when the 5g standards are published we may not be able to produce a satisfactory return on investment if our strategic vision and the resources that we are spending on developing our presence in the 5g technology industry turn out to be misaligned with such standards we provide solutions for the design development and manufacturing stages of our customers’ workflow our customers who currently use our solutions in one stage of their workflow may not use our solutions in other aspects of their manufacturing process 

uncertainty in general economic conditions may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

our business is sensitive to negative changes in general economic conditions both inside and outside the united states global and regional economic uncertainty or depression may impact our business resulting in 



  

in addition global and regional macroeconomic developments such as increased unemployment decreased income reduced access to credit volatility in capital markets decreased liquidity uncertain or destabilizing national election results in the us europe and asia and negative changes or volatility in general economic conditions in the us europe and asia could negatively affect our ability to conduct business in those territories financial difficulties experienced by our suppliers and customers including distributors due to economic volatility or negative changes could result in product delays and inventory issues economic risks related to accounts receivable could result in delays in collection and greater bad debt expense 

our operating results and financial condition could be harmed if the markets into which we sell our solutions decline or do not grow as anticipated 

visibility into our markets is limited our quarterly sales and operating results are highly dependent on the volume and timing of technologyrelated spending and orders received during the fiscal quarter which are difficult to forecast and may be cancelled by our customers in addition our revenues and earnings forecasts for future fiscal quarters are often based on the expected seasonality or cyclicality of our markets however the markets we serve do not always experience the seasonality or cyclicality that we expect any decline in our customers markets would likely result in a reduction in demand for our solutions and services the broader semiconductor market is one of the drivers for our business and therefore a decrease in the semiconductor market could harm our business also if our customers markets decline we may not be able to collect on outstanding amounts due to us such declines could harm our financial position results of operations cash flows and stock price and could limit our profitability also in such an environment pricing pressures could intensify since a significant portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed in nature due to sales rd and manufacturing costs if we were unable to respond quickly enough these pricing pressures could further reduce our operating margins 

failure to adjust our purchases due to changing market conditions or failure to estimate our customers demand could adversely affect our income 

our income could be harmed if we are unable to adjust our purchases to market fluctuations including those caused by the seasonal or cyclical nature of the markets in which we operate the sale of our solutions and services are dependent to a large degree on customers whose industries are subject to seasonal or cyclical trends in the demand for their products for example the consumer electronics market is particularly volatile making demand difficult to anticipate during a market upturn we may not be able to purchase sufficient supplies or components to meet increasing product demand which could materially affect our results in the past we have seen a shortage of parts for some of our products in addition some of the parts that require custom design are not readily available from alternate suppliers due to their unique design or the length of time necessary for design work should a supplier cease manufacturing such a component we would be forced to reengineer our solution in addition to discontinuing parts suppliers may also extend lead times limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors in order to secure components for the production of products we may continue to enter into noncancellable purchase commitments with vendors or at times make advance payments to suppliers which could impact our ability to adjust our inventory to declining market demands prior commitments of this type have resulted in an excess of parts when demand for electronic products has decreased if demand for our solutions is less than we expect we may experience additional excess and obsolete inventories and be forced to incur additional charges 

economic and political policies favoring national interests could adversely affect our results of operations 

nationalistic economic policies and political trends in the united states the united kingdom the european union singapore malaysia and china among other countries such as opposition to globalization and free trade sanctions or trade restrictions withdrawal from or renegotiation of global trade agreements tax policies that favor domestic industries and interests the anticipated exit of the united kingdom from the european union known as brexit the distancing or potential exit of other countries from the european union and other similar actions may result in increased transaction costs reduced ability to hire employees reduced access to supplies and materials reduced demand or access to customers in international markets and inability to conduct our operations as they have been conducted historically each of these factors may adversely affect our business 

international trade disputes and increased tariffs between the united states and such jurisdictions could substantially change our expectations and ability to operate in such jurisdictions as we have done historically many of our suppliers vendors customers partners and other entities with whom we do business have strong ties to doing business in china their ability to supply materials to us buy products or services from us or otherwise work with us is affected by their ability to do business in china if the us’s relationship with china deteriorates or results in trade disputes trade protection measures retaliatory actions tariffs and increased barriers policies that favor domestic industries or increased import or export licensing requirements or restrictions then our deployment of resources in jurisdictions affected by such measures could be misaligned and our operations may be adversely affected due to such changes in the economic and political ecosystem in which our suppliers vendors customers partners and other entities with whom we do business operate 

  

a decreased demand for our customers’ products or trade restrictions could adversely affect our results of operations 

our business depends on our customers’ ability to manufacture design and sell their products in the marketplace international trade disputes affecting our customers could adversely affect our business tariffs on imports to or from china could increase the cost of our customers’ components and raw materials which could make our customers’ products and services more expensive and could reduce demand for our customers’ products protectionist and retaliatory trade measures by either china or the united states could limit our customers’ ability to sell their products and services and could reduce demand of our customers’ products our customers and other entities in our customer chain could decide to take actions in response to international trade disputes that we could not foresee a decrease in demand or significant change in operations from our customers due to international trade disputes could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

in addition to the above our customers and suppliers could become subject to us export restrictions and sanctions such as being added to the us department of commerce’s “lists of parties of concern” and having us export privileges denied or suspended in the event that a customer or supplier of ours becomes subject to such sanctions we will suspend our business with such customer or supplier because of the increasingly tense political and economic relationship between the united states and china such sanctions could be imposed with little notice which could leave us without an adequate alternative solution to compensate for our inability to continue to do business with such customer or supplier some of our suppliers and customers in the supply chain are working on unique solutions and products in the market and it may be difficult if not impossible to replace them especially with short notice we cannot predict what impact future sanctions could have on our customers or suppliers and therefore our business any export restrictions or sanctions and any tariffs or other trade restriction imposed on our customers or suppliers could adversely affect our financial condition and business 

economic political and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our results of operations 

because we sell our solutions worldwide our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally we anticipate that revenue from international operations will continue to represent a majority of our total revenue however there can be no assurances that our international sales will continue at existing levels or grow in accordance with our effort to increase foreign market penetration in addition many of our employees contract manufacturers suppliers job functions and manufacturing facilities are located outside the united states accordingly our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors including but not limited to 

 we centralize most of our accounting processes at two locations india and malaysia these processes include general accounting inventory cost accounting accounts payable and accounts receivables functions if conditions change in those countries it may adversely affect operations including impairing our ability to pay our suppliers our results of operations as well as our liquidity may be adversely affected and possible delays may occur in reporting financial results 

  

further even if we are able to successfully manage the risks of international operations our business may be adversely affected if our business partners are not able to successfully manage similar risks 

dependence on contract manufacturing and outsourcing other portions of our supply chain may adversely affect our ability to bring solutions to market and damage our reputation dependence on outsourced information technology and other administrative functions may impair our ability to operate effectively 

as part of our efforts to streamline operations and to cut costs we outsource aspects of our manufacturing processes and other functions and continue to evaluate additional outsourcing if our contract manufacturers or other outsourcers fail to perform their obligations in a timely manner or at satisfactory quality levels our ability to bring solutions to market and our reputation could suffer for example during a market upturn our contract manufacturers may be unable to meet our demand requirements which may preclude us from fulfilling our customers orders on a timely basis the ability of these manufacturers to perform is largely outside of our control additionally changing or replacing our contract manufacturers or other outsourcees could cause disruptions or delays in addition we outsource significant portions of our information technology it and other administrative functions since it is critical to our operations any failure of our it providers to perform could impair our ability to operate effectively in addition to the risks outlined above problems with manufacturing or it outsourcing could result in lower revenues and unrealized efficiencies and could impact our results of operations and stock price much of our outsourcing takes place in developing countries and as a result may be subject to geopolitical uncertainty 

our operating results may suffer if our manufacturing capacity does not match the demand for our solutions 

because we cannot immediately adapt our production capacity and related cost structures to rapidly changing market conditions when demand does not meet our expectations our manufacturing capacity will likely exceed our production requirements during a general market upturn or an upturn in our business we cannot increase our manufacturing capacity to meet product demand we will not be able to fulfill orders in a timely manner which could lead to order cancellations contract breaches or indemnification obligations this inability could materially and adversely limit our ability to improve our income margin and operating results by contrast if during an economic downturn we had excess manufacturing capacity then our fixed costs associated with excess manufacturing capacity would adversely affect our income margins and operating results 

key customers or large orders may expose us to additional business and legal risks that could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition  

certain key customers have substantial purchasing power and leverage in negotiating contractual arrangements with us these customers may demand contract terms that differ considerably from our standard terms and conditions large orders may also include severe contractual liabilities for us if we fail to provide the quantity and quality of product at the required delivery times while we attempt to contractually limit our potential liability under such contracts we may have to agree to some or all of these types of provisions to secure these orders and to continue to grow our business such actions expose us to significant additional risks which could result in a material adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition 

industry consolidation and consolidation among our customer base may lead to increased competition and may harm our operating results 

there is potential for industry consolidation in our markets as companies attempt to strengthen or hold their market positions in an evolving industry companies could be acquired or may be unable to continue operations companies that are strategic alliance partners in some areas of our business may acquire or form alliances with our competitors thereby reducing their business with us we believe that industry consolidation may result in stronger competitors and could lead to more variability in our operating results and could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition furthermore particularly in the communications market rapid consolidation would lead to fewer customers with the effect that loss of a major customer could have a material impact on results not anticipated in a customer marketplace composed of more numerous participants 

additionally if there is consolidation among our customer base our customers may be able to command increased leverage in negotiating prices and other terms of sale which could adversely affect our profitability in addition if as a result of increased leverage customer pressures require us to reduce our pricing such that our gross margins are diminished we could decide not to sell our solutions under such less favorable terms which would decrease our revenue consolidation among our customer base may also lead to reduced demand for our solutions replacement of our products by the combined entity with those of our competitors and cancellations of orders each of which could harm our operating results 

  

our acquisitions strategic alliances joint ventures internal reorganizations and divestitures may result in financial results that are different than expected 

in the normal course of business we may engage in discussions with third parties relating to possible acquisitions strategic alliances joint ventures and divestitures additionally we occasionally make changes to our internal structure to align business products services and solutions with market demands and to obtain cost synergies and operational efficiencies as a result of such transactions our financial results may differ from our own or the investment communitys expectations in a given fiscal quarter or over the long term if market conditions or other factors lead us to change our strategic direction we may not realize the expected value from such transactions or reorganizations further such thirdparty transactions often have postclosing arrangements including but not limited to postclosing adjustments transition services escrows or indemnifications the financial results of which can be difficult to predict in addition acquisitions and strategic alliances may require us to integrate a different company culture management team employees and business infrastructure into our existing operations without impacting the business operations of the newly acquired company we may have difficulty developing manufacturing and marketing the products of a newly acquired company in a way that enhances performance and expands the markets of the newly acquired company the acquired company may not enhance the performance of our businesses or product lines such that we do not realize the value from expected synergies depending on the size and complexity of an acquisition the successful integration of the entity depends on a variety of factors including but not limited to 

 if we do not realize the expected benefits or synergies of such transactions our consolidated financial position results of operations cash flows and stock price could be negatively impacted additionally we may record significant goodwill and other assets as a result of acquisitions or investments and we may be required to incur impairment charges which could adversely affect our consolidated financial position and results of operations 

any inability to complete acquisitions on acceptable terms could negatively impact our growth rate and financial performance 

our ability to grow revenues earnings and cash flow depends in part upon our ability to identify and successfully acquire and integrate businesses at appropriate prices and realize anticipated synergies and business performance appropriate targets for acquisition are difficult to identify and complete for a variety of reasons including but not limited to limited due diligence high valuations business and intellectual property evaluations other interested parties negotiations of the definitive documentation satisfaction of closing conditions the need to obtain antitrust or other regulatory approvals on acceptable terms and availability of funding the inability to close appropriate acquisitions on acceptable terms could adversely impact our growth rate revenue and financial performance 

we may need additional financing in the future to meet our capital needs or to make opportunistic acquisitions and such financing may not be available on terms favorable to us if at all and may be dilutive to existing shareholders 

we may need to seek additional financing for our general corporate purposes for example we may need to increase our investment in rd activities or need funds to make acquisitions we may be unable to obtain any desired additional financing on terms favorable to us if at all if adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms we may be unable to fund our expansion successfully develop or enhance solutions or respond to competitive pressures any of which could negatively affect our business if we finance acquisitions by issuing additional convertible debt or equity securities our existing stockholders may experience share dilution which could affect the market price of our stock if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity securities our shareholders will experience dilution of their ownership interest if we raise additional funds by issuing debt we may be subject to further limitations on our operations and ability to pay dividends due to restrictive covenants 

  

we have outstanding debt and may incur other debt in the future which could adversely affect our financial condition liquidity and results of operations 

we currently have outstanding debt as well as availability to borrow under a revolving credit facility we may borrow additional amounts in the future and use the proceeds from any future borrowing for general corporate purposes future acquisitions expansion of our business or repurchases of our outstanding shares of common stock 

our incurrence of this debt and increases in our aggregate levels of debt may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition by among other things 

 our current revolving credit facility and term loan imposes restrictions on us including restrictions on our ability to create liens on our assets and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur indebtedness and requires us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios our ability to comply with these ratios may be affected by events beyond our control in addition the indenture governing our senior notes contains covenants that may adversely affect our ability to incur certain liens or engage in certain types of sale and leaseback transactions if we breach any of the covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders then subject to applicable cure periods our outstanding indebtedness could be declared immediately due and payable 

if currency exchange rates fluctuate substantially in the future our financial results could be adversely affected 

a substantial amount of our solutions are priced and paid for in us dollars although many of our solutions are priced in local currencies and a significant amount of certain types of expenses such as payroll utilities tax and marketing expenses are paid in local currencies our hedging programs are designed to reduce but not entirely eliminate within any given 12month period the impact of currency exchange rate movements including those caused by currency controls which could impact our business operating results and financial condition by resulting in lower revenue or increased expenses however for expenses beyond a 12month period our hedging strategy will not mitigate our exchange rate risk in addition our currency hedging programs involve thirdparty financial institutions as counterparties the weakening or failure of these counterparties may adversely affect our hedging programs and our financial condition through among other things a reduction in the number of available counterparties increasingly unfavorable terms or the failure of counterparties to perform under hedging contracts 

third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property rights and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling solutions or services 

third parties may claim that one or more of our solutions or services infringe their intellectual property rights we analyze and take action in response to such claims on a casebycase basis any dispute or litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and timeconsuming due to the complexity of our technology and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation and could divert our management and key personnel from business operations a claim of intellectual property infringement could cause us to enter into a costly or restrictive license agreement which may not be available under acceptable terms or at all require us to redesign certain of our solutions which would be costly and timeconsuming andor subject us to significant damages or an injunction against the development and sale of certain solutions or services in certain of our businesses we rely on thirdparty intellectual property licenses and we cannot ensure that these licenses will be available to us in the future on terms favorable to us or at all 

third parties may infringe our intellectual property rights and we may suffer competitive injury or expend significant resources enforcing our intellectual property rights 

our success depends in part on our proprietary technology including technology we obtained through acquisitions we rely on various intellectual property rights including patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets as well as confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish our proprietary rights if we do not enforce our intellectual property rights successfully our competitive position may suffer which could harm our operating results 

our pending patent copyright and trademark registration applications may not be allowed or competitors may challenge the validity or scope of our patents copyrights or trademarks in addition our patents copyrights trademarks and other intellectual property rights may not provide us with a significant competitive advantage in preparation for the separation and distribution we have applied for trademarks related to our new global brand name in various jurisdictions worldwide any successful opposition 

  

to our applications in material jurisdictions could impose material costs on us or make it more difficult to protect our brand different jurisdictions vary widely in the level of protection and priority they give to trademark and other intellectual property rights 

we may be required to spend significant resources monitoring our intellectual property rights and we may or may not be able to detect infringement of such rights by third parties our competitive position may be harmed if we cannot detect infringement and enforce our intellectual property rights in a timely manner or at all in some circumstances we may choose to not pursue enforcement due to a variety of reasons in addition competitors may avoid infringement by designing around our intellectual property rights or by developing noninfringing competing technologies intellectual property rights and our ability to enforce them may be unavailable or limited in some countries which could make it easier for competitors to capture market share and could result in lost revenues to the company furthermore some of our intellectual property is licensed to others which allows them to compete with us using that intellectual property 

if we experience a significant cybersecurity attack or disruption in our it systems our business reputation and operating results could be adversely affected 

we rely on several centralized it systems to provide solutions and services maintain financial records retain sensitive data such as intellectual property proprietary business information and data related to customers suppliers and business partners process orders manage inventory process shipments to customers and operate other critical functions the ongoing maintenance and security of this information is pertinent to the success of our business operations and our strategic goals 

despite our implementation of network security measures our network may be vulnerable to cybersecurity attacks computer viruses breakins and similar disruptions our network security measures include but are not limited to the implementation of firewalls antivirus protection patches log monitors routine backups offsite storage network audits and routine updates and modifications despite our efforts to create these security barriers we may not be able to keep pace as new threats emerge and it is virtually impossible for us to entirely eliminate this risk cybersecurity attacks are evolving and include but are not limited to malicious software attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation operating results and financial condition and no assurance can be given that our efforts to reduce the risk of such attacks will be successful 

in addition our it systems may be susceptible to damage disruptions or shutdowns due to power outages hardware failures telecommunication failures user errors implementation of new operational systems or software or upgrades to existing systems and software or catastrophes or other unforeseen events such events could result in the disruption of business processes network degradation and system downtime along with the potential that a third party will exploit our critical assets such as intellectual property proprietary business information and data related to our customers suppliers and business partners further such events could result in loss of revenue loss of or reduction in purchase orders inability to report financial information litigation regulatory fines and penalties and other damage that could have a material impact on our business operations to the extent that such disruptions occur our customers and partners may lose confidence in our solutions and we may lose business or brand reputation resulting in a material and adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

we are or will be subject to ongoing tax examinations of our tax returns by the irs and other tax authorities an adverse outcome of any such audit or examination by the irs or other tax authority could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

we are or will be subject to ongoing tax examinations of our tax returns by the irs and other tax authorities in various jurisdictions we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from ongoing tax examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes these assessments can require considerable estimates and judgments intercompany transactions associated with the sale of inventory services intellectual property and cost sharing arrangements are complex and affect our tax liabilities the calculation of our tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in multiple jurisdictions the outcomes of these tax examinations could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition due to the complexity of tax contingencies the ultimate resolution of any tax matters related to operations may result in payments greater or less than amounts accrued 

our operations may be adversely impacted by changes in our business mix or changes in the tax legislative landscape 

our effective tax rate may be adversely impacted by among other things changes in the mix of our earnings among countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets and changes in tax laws we cannot give any assurance as to what our effective tax rate will be in the future because among other things there is uncertainty regarding the tax policies of the jurisdictions where we operate changes in tax laws such as tax reform in the united states or changes in 

  

tax laws resulting from the organization for economic cooperation and development’s “oecd” multijurisdictional plan of action to address “base erosion and profit shifting” and the taxation of the “digital economy” could impact our effective tax rate 

if tax laws or incentives change or cease to be in effect our income taxes could increase significantly 

we are subject to federal state and local taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions we devote significant resources to evaluating our tax positions and our worldwide provision for taxes our financial results and tax treatment are susceptible to changes in tax accounting and other laws regulations principles and interpretations in the united states and in other jurisdictions where we do business with the rise of economic and political policies that favor domestic interests it is possible that more countries will enact tax laws that either increase the tax rates or reduce or change the tax incentives available to multinational companies like ours upon a change in tax laws in any territory where we do significant business such as the us the european union or singapore we may not be able to maintain our current tax rate or qualify for or maintain the benefits of any tax incentives offered to the extent such incentives are offered 

we currently benefit from tax incentives extended to certain of our foreign subsidiaries to encourage investment or employment the most significant of which being singapore the singapore tax incentives require that specific conditions be satisfied which include achieving thresholds of employment ownership of certain assets as well as specific types of investment activities within singapore based on the current tax environment we believe that we will satisfy such conditions in the future as needed but cannot guarantee that the tax environment will not change or that such conditions will be satisfied 

our singapore tax incentives are due for renewal in fiscal 2024 but we cannot guarantee that singapore will not revoke the tax incentives earlier our taxes could increase if the existing singapore incentives are not renewed upon revocation or expiration we cannot guarantee that we will qualify for any new incentive regime that may exist in fiscal 2024 or that such conditions will be satisfied if we cannot or do not wish to satisfy all or portions of the tax incentives conditions we may lose the related tax incentives and could be required to refund the benefits that the tax incentives previously provided as a result our effective tax rate could be higher than it would have been had we maintained the benefits of the tax incentives and could harm our operating results 

our business will suffer if we are not able to retain and hire key personnel 

our future success depends partly on the continued service of our key research engineering sales marketing manufacturing executive and administrative personnel including personnel joining our company through acquisitions the markets in which we operate are dynamic and we may need to respond with reorganizations workforce reductions and site closures from time to time we believe our pay levels are competitive within the regions that we operate however there is also intense competition for certain highly technical specialties in geographic areas in which we operate and it may become more difficult to retain key employees if we fail to retain and hire a sufficient number of these personnel we may not be able to meet key objectives such as launching effective product innovations and meeting financial goals and maintain or expand our business 

if we suffer a loss to our factories facilities or distribution system due to a catastrophic event our operations could be significantly harmed 

our factories facilities and distribution system are subject to catastrophic loss due to fire flood terrorism or other natural or manmade disasters in particular several of our facilities could be subject to a catastrophic loss caused by earthquake or other natural disasters due to their locations for example our production facilities headquarters and laboratories in california and our production facilities in japan are all located in areas with aboveaverage seismic activity if any of these facilities were to experience a catastrophic loss it could disrupt our operations delay production shipments and revenue and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility if such a disruption were to occur we could breach our agreements our reputation could be harmed and our business and operating results could be adversely affected in addition since we have consolidated our manufacturing facilities we are more likely to experience an interruption to our operations in the event of a catastrophe in any one location although we carry insurance for property damage and business interruption we do not carry insurance or financial reserves for interruptions or potential losses arising from earthquakes or terrorism also our thirdparty insurance coverage will vary from time to time in both type and amount depending on availability cost and our decision with respect to risk retention economic conditions and uncertainties in global markets may adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain thirdparty insurance if our thirdparty insurance coverage is adversely affected or to the extent we have elected to selfinsure we may be at a greater risk that our operations will be harmed by a catastrophic loss 

if we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with certain regulations we may be subject to substantial negative financial consequences and civil or criminal penalties 

we and our customers are subject to various significant international federal state and local regulations including but not limited to health and safety packaging data privacy product content labor and importexport regulations these regulations are 

  

complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time we may be required to incur significant expenses to comply with these regulations or to remedy violations of these regulations any failure by us to comply with applicable government regulations could also result in cessation of our operations or portions of our operations high financial penalties product recalls or impositions of fines and restrictions on our ability to carry on or expand our operations if demand for our solutions is adversely affected or our costs increase our business would suffer 

we have developed internal data handling policies and practices to comply with the general data protection regulation “gdpr” in the european union and data privacy regulations similar to gdpr in other jurisdictions our existing business strategy does not rely on aggregating or selling personally identifiable information and as a general matter keysight does not process personally identifiable information on behalf of our customers we devote resources to keep up with the changing regulatory environment on data privacy in the jurisdictions where we do business despite our efforts no assurance can be given that we will be compliant with data privacy regulations new laws amendments or interpretations of regulations industry standards and contractual obligations relating to data privacy may require us to incur additional costs and restrict our business operations if we fail to comply with gdpr or other data privacy regulation we may be subject to significant financial fines and civil or criminal penalties and may suffer damage to our reputation or brand which could adversely affect our business and financial results 

in addition our products and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies like the international standards organization as well as regulation by other agencies such as the us federal communications commission we also must comply with work safety rules if we fail to adequately address any of these regulations our businesses could be harmed 

failure to comply with anticorruption laws could adversely affect our business and result in financial penalties 

because we have extensive international operations we must comply with complex foreign and us laws and regulations such as the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials and anticompetition regulations although we actively maintain policies and procedures designed to ensure ongoing compliance with these laws and regulations there can be no assurance that our employees contractors or agents will not violate these policies and procedures violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties criminal sanctions restrictions on our business conduct and on our ability to offer our solutions in one or more countries and could also materially affect our brand ability to attract and retain employees international operations business and operating results 

our business and financial results may be adversely affected by various legal and regulatory proceedings 

we are subject to legal proceedings lawsuits and other claims in the normal course of business and could become subject to additional claims in the future some of which could be material the outcome of existing proceedings lawsuits and claims may differ from our expectations because the outcomes of litigation are often difficult to reliably predict various factors or developments can lead us to change current estimates of liabilities and related insurance receivables where applicable or permit us to make such estimates for matters previously not susceptible to reasonable estimates such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment a significant settlement significant regulatory developments or changes in applicable law a future adverse ruling settlement or unfavorable development could result in charges that could adversely affect our business operating results or financial condition 

our internal controls may be determined to be ineffective which may adversely affect investor confidence in our company the value of our stock and our access to capital 

the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 requires us to furnish a report by management on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting among other things we are devoting significant resources and time to comply with such internal control over financial reporting requirements however we cannot be certain that these measures will ensure that we design implement and maintain adequate control over our financial processes and reporting in the future especially in the context of acquisitions of other businesses any difficulties in the assimilation of acquired businesses into our control system could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations inferior internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our stock or on our access to capital or cause us to be subject to investigation or sanctions by the sec 

adverse conditions in the global banking industry and credit markets may adversely impact the value of our cash investments or impair our liquidity 

our cash and cash equivalents are invested or held in a mix of money market funds time deposit accounts and bank demand deposit accounts disruptions in the financial markets may in some cases result in an inability to access assets such as money market funds that traditionally have been viewed as highly liquid any failure of our counterparty financial institutions or funds in which we have invested may adversely impact our cash and cash equivalent positions and in turn our results and financial condition 

  

future investment returns on pension assets may be lower than expected or interest rates may decline requiring us to make significant additional cash contributions to our future plans 

we sponsor several defined benefit pension plans that cover many of our salaried and hourly employees the federal pension protection act of 2006 requires that certain capitalization levels be maintained in each of the us plans and there may be similar funding requirements in the plans outside the united states because it is unknown what the investment return on and the fair value of our pension assets will be in future years or what interest rates and discount rates may be at any point in time no assurances can be given that applicable law will not require us to make future material plan contributions any such contributions could adversely affect our financial condition 

environmental contamination from past operations could subject us to unreimbursed costs and could harm onsite operations and the future use and value of the properties involved and environmental contamination caused by ongoing operations could subject us to substantial liabilities in the future 

some of our properties are undergoing remediation by hp inc hp for subsurface contaminations that were known at the time of agilents separation from hp in 1999 in connection with agilents separation from hp hp and agilent entered into an agreement pursuant to which hp agreed to retain the liability for this subsurface contamination perform the required remediation and indemnify agilent with respect to claims arising out of that contamination agilent has assigned its rights and obligations under this agreement to keysight in respect of facilities transferred to us in the separation as a result hp will have access to a limited number of our properties to perform remediation although hp agreed to minimize interference with onsite operations at such properties remediation activities and subsurface contamination may require us to incur unreimbursed costs and could harm onsite operations and the future use and value of the properties in connection with the separation agilent will indemnify us directly for any liabilities related thereto we cannot be sure that hp will continue to fulfill its remediation obligations or that agilent will continue to fulfill its indemnification obligations 

in connection with the separation from agilent agilent also agreed to indemnify us for any liability associated with contamination from past operations at all properties transferred from agilent to keysight we cannot be sure that agilent will fulfill its indemnification obligations 

our current manufacturing processes involve the use of substances regulated under various international federal state and local laws governing the environment as a result we may become subject to liabilities for environmental contamination and these liabilities may be substantial although our policy is to apply strict standards for environmental protection at our sites inside and outside the united states even if the sites outside the united states are not subject to regulations imposed by foreign governments we may not be aware of all conditions that could subject us to liability 

risks related to our common stock 

our share price may fluctuate significantly 

our common stock is listed on nyse under the ticker symbol “keys” the market price of our common stock may fluctuate widely depending on many factors some of which may be beyond our control including but not limited to 



  

 stock markets in general have experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company these broad market fluctuations could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 

in addition when the market price of a company’s shares drops significantly shareholders often institute securities class action lawsuits against the company a lawsuit against us could cause us to incur substantial costs and could divert the time and attention of management and other resources 

we do not currently pay dividends on our common stock 

we do not currently pay dividends on our common stock the payment of any dividends in the future and the timing and amount thereof to our stockholders fall within the discretion of our board of directors the boards decisions regarding the payment of dividends will depend on many factors such as our financial condition earnings capital requirements debt service obligations restrictive covenants in our debt industry practice legal requirements regulatory constraints and other factors that the board deems relevant we cannot guarantee that we will pay a dividend in the future or continue to pay any dividends if we commence paying dividends 

certain provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and of delaware law may prevent or delay an acquisition of the company which could decrease the trading price of our common stock 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain and delaware law contains provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by making such practices or bids unacceptably expensive to the bidder and to encourage prospective acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover these provisions include but are not limited to 

 in addition because we have not chosen to be exempt from section 203 of the delaware general corporation law the dgcl this provision could also delay or prevent a change of control that some shareholders may favor section 203 provides that subject to limited exceptions persons that acquire or are affiliated with a person that acquires more than 15 percent of the outstanding voting stock of a delaware corporation an interested stockholder shall not engage in any business combination 

  

with that corporation including by merger consolidation or acquisitions of additional shares for a threeyear period following the date on which the person became an interested stockholder unless i prior to such time the board of directors of such corporation approved either the business combination or the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder ii upon consummation of the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder the interested stockholder owned at least 85 percent of the voting stock of such corporation at the time the transaction commenced excluding for purposes of determining the voting stock outstanding but not the outstanding voting stock owned by the interested stockholder the voting stock owned by directors who are also officers or held in employee benefit plans in which the employees do not have a confidential right to tender or vote stock held by the plan or iii on or subsequent to such time the business combination is approved by the board of directors of such corporation and authorized at a meeting of shareholders by the affirmative vote of at least twothirds of the outstanding voting stock of such corporation not owned by the interested stockholder 

we believe these provisions will protect our shareholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors and by providing our board of directors with more time to assess any acquisition proposal these provisions are not intended to make us immune from takeovers however these provisions will apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some shareholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that our board of directors determines is not in the best interests of the company and our shareholders these provisions may also prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates that the state courts in the state of delaware or if no state court located within the state of delaware has jurisdiction the federal court for the district of delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our shareholders which could discourage lawsuits against the company and our directors and officers 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provide that unless the board of directors otherwise determines the state courts in the state of delaware or if no state court located within the state of delaware has jurisdiction the federal court for the district of delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors or officers to the company or our shareholders any action asserting a claim against us or any of our directors or officers arising pursuant to any provision of the dgcl or keysights amended and restated certificate of incorporation or bylaws or any action asserting a claim against us or any of our directors or officers governed by the internal affairs doctrine this exclusive forum provision may limit the ability of our shareholders to bring a claim in a judicial forum that such shareholders find favorable for disputes with us or our directors or officers which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors and officers

currency exchange rate exposure 

our revenues expenses and monetary assets and liabilities are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our global operating and financing activities we hedge revenues expenses and balance sheet exposures that are not denominated in the functional currencies of our subsidiaries on a shortterm and anticipated basis the result of the hedging has been included in our consolidated statement of operations we experience some fluctuations within individual lines of the consolidated balance sheet and consolidated statement of operations because our hedging program is not designed to offset the currency movements in each category of revenues expenses monetary assets and liabilities our hedging program is designed to hedge currency movements on a relatively shortterm basis of up to twelve months in advance therefore we are exposed to currency fluctuations over the longer term to the extent that we are required to pay for all or portions of an acquisition price in foreign currencies we may enter into foreign exchange contracts to reduce the risk that currency movements will impact the us dollar cost of the transaction 

results from operations  years ended october 31 2019 2018 and 2017

backlog 

backlog represents the amount of revenue expected from orders that have already been booked including orders for goods and services that have not been delivered to customers orders invoiced but not yet recognized as revenue and orders for goods that were shipped but not invoiced awaiting acceptance by customers andor completion of a commitment to a customer 

at october 31 2019 our unfilled backlog was approximately 1380 million as compared to approximately 1311 million at october 31 2018 our unfilled backlog as of october 31 2019 reflects the impact of the deferred revenue adjustment related to the adoption of accounting standards update 201409 revenue from contracts with customers asc 606  see note 2 new accounting pronouncements for additional information consistent with our strategy we are seeing an increase in solution sales which have a longer ordertorevenue conversion cycle however we expect that the majority of unfilled backlog will be recognized as revenue within six months while backlog on any particular date can be an indicator of shortterm revenue performance it is not necessarily a reliable indicator of medium or longterm revenue performance 

costs and expenses 





gross margin increased 5 percentage points in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily driven by higher revenue volume highly differentiated solutions favorable mix and a decline in warranty costs gross margin increased 1 percentage point in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily driven by gains related to revenue volume and favorable mix partially offset by increases in variable peoplerelated costs and amortization of acquisitionrelated balances

research and development expense increased 10 percent in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily driven by greater investment in key growth opportunities in our end markets leadingedge technologies people and infrastructure research and development expense increased 23 percent in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily driven by the addition of acquired companies to our cost structure an increase in variable peoplerelated costs and our continued investment in research and development programs partially offset by nonrecurring acquisitionrelated compensation expense in 2017 research and development expenses as a percent of total revenue were 16 percent in each of the three years 2019 2018 and 2017 

selling general and administrative expenses decreased 4 percent in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily driven by a decline in litigation and restructuring costs and acquisition and integration costs partially offset by an increase in people related costs selling general and administrative expenses increased 14 percent for 2018 compared to 2017 primarily driven by the addition of acquired companies to our cost structure and increases in variable peoplerelated litigation and restructuring costs partially offset by the elimination of nonrecurring acquisitionrelated compensation expense separation and related costs acquisition and integration costs and the unfavorable impact from northern california wildfirerelated costs 

in 2018 we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of 709 million for the ixia solutions group based on the results of our annual impairment test of goodwill see note 11 goodwill and other intangible assets to our consolidated financial statements for additional information 

  

other operating expense income net primarily includes property rental income and was income of 20 million 33 million and 16 million for 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively other operating expense income net for 2018 also includes income from business divestitures 

operating margin increased 27 percentage points in 2019 when compared to 2018 primarily driven by a nonrecurring goodwill impairment charge in 2018 higher revenue volume highly differentiated solutions favorable mix lower acquisition and integration costs and lower litigation and restructuringrelated costs partially offset by an increase in peoplerelated costs operating margin decreased 15 percentage points in 2018 when compared to 2017 primarily driven by goodwill impairment and an increase in variable peoplerelated costs partially offset by gains related to revenue volume and favorable mix 

our headcount was approximately 13600 at october 31 2019 compared to 12900 at october 31 2018 

interest income and expense 

interest income for the years ended october 31 2019 2018 and 2017 was 23 million 12 million and 7 million respectively and primarily relates to interest earned on our cash balances interest expense for the years ended october 31 2019 2018 and 2017 was 80 million 83 million and 80 million respectively and primarily relates to interest on our senior notes

income taxes 



for 2019 the effective tax rate was 13 percent which is lower than the us statutory rate primarily due to a higher percentage of earnings in the nonus jurisdictions taxed at lower statutory tax rates 

for 2018 the effective tax rate was 140 percent which is higher than the us statutory rate primarily due to the net impact of us tax law changes the singapore restructuring and tax incentive modifications completed in 2018 in response to singapore tax law changes and the tax impact of goodwill impairment 

for 2017 the effective tax rate was 43 percent which is higher than the us statutory rate primarily due to the payment of a prior year malaysia tax assessment of 68 million including tax and penalties which we are currently in the process of appealing to the special commissioners of income tax “scit” in malaysia 

we benefit from tax incentives in several different jurisdictions most significantly in singapore that have granted tax incentives that require renewal at various times in the future the tax incentives provide lower rates of taxation on certain classes of income and require various thresholds of investment and employment or specific types of income in those jurisdictions the tax incentives are due for renewal between 2024 and 2025 the impact of the tax incentives decreased income taxes by 47 million 567 million and 49 million in 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively the decrease in the tax benefit from 2018 to 2019 is primarily due to the onetime impacts of the singapore restructuring and tax incentive modifications that were completed in 2018 in response to singapore tax law changes 

the calculation of our tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex tax law and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions although the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes the use of a recognition and measurement model the determination of whether an uncertain tax position has met those thresholds will continue to require significant judgment by management in accordance with the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes for all us and other tax jurisdictions we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes and interest will be due the ultimate resolution of tax uncertainties may differ from what is currently estimated which could result in a material impact on income tax expense if our estimate of income tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment a further charge to expense would be required if the payment of these additional 

  

amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary we include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes in the consolidated statements of operations accrued interest and penalties are included on the related tax liability line in the consolidated balance sheet 

the open tax years for the irs and most states are from november 1 2015 through the current tax year for the majority of our foreign entities the open tax years are from november 1 2014 through the current tax year for certain foreign entities the tax years remain open at most back to 2008 given the number of years and numerous matters that remain subject to examination in various tax jurisdictions we are unable to estimate the range of possible changes to the balance of our unrecognized tax benefits 

the company is being audited in malaysia for the 2008 tax year although this tax year predates our separation from agilent pursuant to the agreement between agilent and keysight pertaining to tax matters as finalized at the time of separation for certain entities including malaysia any historical tax liability is the responsibility of keysight in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 keysight paid income taxes and penalties of 68 million on gains related to intellectual property rights although we are currently in the process of appealing to the scit in malaysia the company believes there are numerous defenses to the current assessment the statute of limitations for the 2008 tax year in malaysia was closed and the income in question is exempt from tax in malaysia the company is disputing this assessment and pursuing all avenues to resolve this issue favorably for the company

off balance sheet arrangements and other 

we have contractual commitments for noncancellable operating leases see note 17 commitments and contingencies to our consolidated financial statements for further information on our noncancellable operating leases 

our liquidity is affected by many factors some of which are based on normal ongoing operations of our business and some of which arise from fluctuations related to global economics and markets our cash balances are generated and held in many locations throughout the world local government regulations may restrict our ability to move cash balances to meet cash needs under certain circumstances we do not currently expect such regulations and restrictions to impact our ability to pay vendors and conduct operations throughout our global organization 

contractual commitments 

our cash flows from operations are dependent on a number of factors including fluctuations in our operating results accounts receivable collections inventory management and the timing of tax and other payments as a result the impact of contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be analyzed in conjunction with such factors 

  

the following table summarizes our total contractual obligations at october 31 2019 the amounts presented in the table do not reflect 130 million of liabilities for uncertain tax positions as of october 31 2019 we are unable to accurately predict when these amounts will be realized or released however it is reasonably possible that there could be significant changes to our unrecognized tax benefits in the next 12 months due to either the expiration of a statute of limitations or a tax audit settlement 



interest on senior notes we have contractual obligations for interest payments on our senior notes interest rates and payment dates are detailed above under shortterm debt and longterm debt 

operating leases commitments under operating leases relate primarily to leasehold property see note 17 commitments and contingencies 

commitments to contract manufacturers and suppliers we purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products during the normal course of business we issue purchase orders with estimates of our requirements several months ahead of the delivery dates the reported purchase commitments represent the commitments under open purchase orders with our suppliers that have not been received however our agreements with these suppliers usually provide us with the option to cancel reschedule and adjust our requirements based on business needs prior to firm orders being placed we expect to fulfill most of our purchase commitments for inventory within one year 

in addition to the commitments to contract manufacturers and suppliers referenced above we record a liability for firm noncancellable and unconditional purchase commitments for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with our policy relating to excess inventory as of october 31 2019 the liability for our excess firm noncancellable and unconditional purchase commitments was 21 million compared to 17 million as of october 31 2018 these amounts are included in other accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet 

retirement plans commitments under the retirement plans relate to expected contributions to be made to our nonus defined benefit plans for the next year only contributions beyond the next year are impractical to estimate 

we also have benefit payments due under our defined benefit retirement plans and postretirement benefit plan that are not required to be funded in advance but are paid in the same period that benefits are provided see item 8financial statements and supplementary data note 15 retirement plans and postretirement benefit plans for additional information 

us transition tax liability the obligation for the us transition tax liability relates to the onetime us tax on those earnings which have not previously been repatriated to the us the “transition tax” keysight has elected to pay the transition tax over 8 years see item 7 managements discussion and analysis “income taxes” for additional information on the transition tax 

other purchase commitments other purchase commitments relate to contracts with professional services suppliers we can typically cancel these contracts within 90 days without penalties for those contracts that are not cancellable within 90 days without penalties we disclose the amounts we are obligated to pay to a supplier under each contract in that period before such contract can be canceled as of october 31 2019  our contractual obligations with these suppliers was approximately 69 million within the next fiscal year as compared to approximately 59 million as of october 31 2018 

we had no material offbalance sheet arrangements as of october 31 2019 or october 31 2018 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable although these estimates are based on managements best knowledge of current events and actions that may impact 

  

the company in the future actual results may be different from the estimates an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur could materially change the financial statements our critical accounting policies are those that affect our financial statements materially and involve difficult subjective or complex judgments by management those policies are revenue recognition inventory valuation sharebased compensation retirement and postretirement plan assumptions valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets warranty loss contingencies restructuring and accounting for income taxes 

revenue recognition in may 2014 the financial accounting standards board issued accounting standard update 201409 revenue from contracts with customers  which became effective for us beginning november 1 2018 for additional information on the new revenue recognition guidance and the impact of adoption see note 1 “overview basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies” note 2 “new accounting pronouncements” and note 4 “revenue” to the consolidated financial statements 

revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of the promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services we primarily generate revenue from the sale of products hardware andor software services or a combination thereof we enter into contracts that may involve multiple performance obligations and we allocate the transaction price between each performance obligation on the basis of relative standalone selling price “ssp” we recognize revenue following the fivestep model 



  

of the related service for other professional services or timebased labor contracts revenue is recognized as we perform the services and the customers receive andor consume the benefits 

inventory valuation we assess the valuation of our inventory on a periodic basis and make adjustments to the value for estimated excess and obsolete inventory based upon estimates about future demand and actual usage such estimates are difficult to make under most economic conditions the excess balance determined by this analysis becomes the basis for our excess inventory charge our excess inventory review process includes analysis of sales forecasts managing product rollovers and working with manufacturing to maximize recovery of excess inventory if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management additional writedowns may be required if actual market conditions are more favorable than anticipated inventory previously written down may be sold to customers resulting in lower cost of sales and higher income from operations than expected in that period 

sharebased compensation we account for sharebased awards in accordance with the provisions of the authoritative accounting guidance which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all sharebased payment awards made to our employees and directors the fair value of sharebased awards for employee stock option awards was estimated using the blackscholes option pricing model awards granted under the keysight technologies inc longterm performance ltp program are based on a variety of targets such as total shareholder return tsr or financial metrics such as operating margin cost synergies and others the awards based on tsr were valued using a monte carlo simulation model and those based on financial metrics were valued based on the market price of keysight’s common stock on the date of grant both the blackscholes and monte carlo simulation fair value models require the use of highly subjective and complex assumptions including the option’s expected life and the price volatility of the underlying stock the estimated fair value of restricted stock awards is determined based on the market price of keysight’s common stock on the date of grant we did not grant any option awards in 2019 2018 and 2017 

retirement and postretirement benefit plan assumptions   retirement and postretirement benefit plan costs are a significant cost of doing business they represent obligations that will ultimately be settled sometime in the future and therefore are subject to estimation pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the employees average expected future service to keysight based on the terms of the plans and investment and funding decisions to estimate the impact of these future payments and our decisions concerning funding of these obligations we are required to make assumptions using actuarial concepts within the framework of accounting principles generally accepted in the us two critical assumptions are the discount rate and the expected longterm return on plan assets other important assumptions include expected future salary increases expected future increases to benefit payments expected retirement dates employee turnover retiree mortality rates and investment portfolio composition we evaluate these assumptions at least annually 

the discount rate is used to determine the present value of future benefit payments at the measurement date which is october 31 for both us and nonus plans the us discount rates as of october 31 2019 and 2018 were determined based on the results of matching expected plan benefit payments with cash flows from a hypothetically constructed bond portfolio the nonus discount rates as of october 31 2019 and 2018 were determined using spot rates along the yield curve to calculate disaggregated discount rates in addition we used this method to calculate two components of the periodic benefit cost service cost and interest cost if we changed our discount rate by 1 percent the impact would be 6 million on us net periodic benefit cost and 11 million on nonus net periodic benefit cost lower discount rates increase the present value of the liability and subsequent year pension expense higher discount rates decrease the present value of the liability and subsequent year pension expense 

the company uses alternate methods of amortization as allowed by the authoritative guidance that amortizes the actuarial gains and losses on a consistent basis for the years presented for us plans gains and losses are amortized over the average future working lifetime for most nonus plans and us postretirement benefit plans gains and losses are amortized using a separate layer for each years gains and losses the expected longterm return on plan assets is estimated using current and expected asset allocations as well as historical and expected returns plan assets are valued at fair value if we changed our estimated return on assets by 1 percent the impact would be 7 million on us net periodic benefit cost and 14 million on nonus net periodic benefit cost 

goodwill and other intangible assets we review goodwill for impairment annually during our fourth fiscal quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable as defined in the authoritative guidance a reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment at the time of an acquisition we assign goodwill to the reporting unit that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination 

companies have the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether performing a quantitative test is necessary if an entity believes as a result of its qualitative assessment that it is morelikelythannot that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount the quantitative impairment test will be required otherwise no further testing will be required 

  

the quantitative impairment test involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount including goodwill we determine the fair value of a reporting unit using the results derived using the market approach when available and appropriate or the income approach or a combination of both if multiple valuation methodologies are used the results are weighted accordingly the income approach is estimated through the discounted cash flow “dcf” analysis determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgment including judgments about appropriate discount rates revenue growth rates and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows discount rates are based on a weighted average cost of capital “wacc” which represents the average rate a business must pay its providers of debt and equity plus a risk premium the wacc used to test goodwill is derived from a group of comparable companies the cash flows employed in the dcf analysis are derived from internal forecasts and external market forecasts the market approach estimates the fair value of the reporting unit by utilizing the market comparable method which is based on revenue and earnings multiples from comparable companies if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value then an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting units fair value up to a maximum amount of the goodwill balance for the reporting unit 

in 2019 we performed our annual impairment test for all our reporting units based on the results of our testing the fair value of each of our reporting units exceeded the carrying value in 2018 we recorded impairment losses of 709 million for our ixia solutions group see note 11 goodwill and other intangible assets to the consolidated financial statements for additional information there was no impairment of goodwill during the year ended october 31 2017 

other intangible assets consist primarily of developed technologies proprietary knowhow trademarks customer relationships noncompete agreements and backlog and are amortized using the straightline method over estimated useful lives ranging from 6 months to 10 years we review other intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of these assets are no longer appropriate no impairments of purchased intangible assets were recorded during the years ended october 31 2019 2018 and 2017 

we review indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of these assets are no longer appropriate the authoritative accounting guidance allows a qualitative approach for testing indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment similar to the impairment testing guidance for goodwill it allows the option to first assess qualitative factors events and circumstances that could have affected the significant inputs used in determining the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset the qualitative factors assist in determining whether it is morelikelythannot that the indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired an organization may choose to bypass the qualitative assessment for any indefinitelived intangible asset in any period and proceed directly to calculating its fair value our indefinitelived intangible assets are inprocess research and development iprd intangible assets in 2019 2018 and 2017 we assessed impairment by performing a qualitative test no impairment of indefinitelived intangible assets was recorded in 2019 in 2018 and 2017 we recorded impairment charges of 5 million and 7 million respectively related to cancellations of iprd projects 

warranty keysight warranties on products sold through direct sales channels are primarily for one year warranties for products sold through distribution channels are primarily for three years we accrue for standard warranty costs based on historical trends in warranty charges the accrual is reviewed regularly and periodically adjusted to reflect changes in warranty cost estimates estimated warranty charges are recorded within cost of products at the time related product revenue is recognized 

we also sell extended warranties that provide warranty coverage beyond the standard warranty term revenue associated with extended warranties is deferred and recognized over the extended coverage period 

loss contingencies as discussed in note 16 and 17 to the consolidated financial statements we are from time to time subject to a variety of litigation and similar contingent liabilities incidental to our business or the business operations of previously owned entities we recognize a liability for any contingency that is known or probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable these assessments require judgments concerning matters such as litigation developments and outcomes the anticipated outcome of negotiations the number of future claims and the cost of both pending and future claims in addition because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time liabilities may change in the future due to various factors changes in these factors could materially impact our financial position or our results of operation 

restructuring the main component of our restructuring plan is related to workforce reductions and site restructuring workforce reduction charges are accrued when payment of benefits becomes probable and the amounts can be estimated if the amounts and timing of cash flows from restructuring activities are significantly different from what we have estimated the actual amount of restructuring and other related charges could be materially different either higher or lower than those we have recorded 

accounting for income taxes we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial 

  

statement purposes these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits benefits and deductions and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes as well as interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period 

significant management judgment is also required in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part when it is morelikelythannot that all or some portion of specific deferred tax assets such as net operating losses or foreign tax credit carryforwards will not be realized a valuation allowance must be established for the amount of the deferred tax assets that cannot be realized we consider all available positive and negative evidence on a jurisdictionbyjurisdiction basis when assessing whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable we consider evidence such as our past operating results the existence of losses in recent years and our forecast of future taxable income at october 31 2019 the company maintains a valuation allowance mainly related to capital losses in the uk net operating losses in the netherlands and uk and california research credits we intend to maintain a valuation allowance in these jurisdictions until sufficient positive evidence exists to support their reversal 

the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax law and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions although the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes the use of a recognition and measurement model the determination of whether an uncertain tax position has met those thresholds will continue to require significant judgment by management in accordance with the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes for all us and other tax jurisdictions we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes and interest will be due the ultimate resolution of tax uncertainties may differ from what is currently estimated which could result in a material impact on income tax expense if our estimate of income tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment a further charge to expense would be required if events occur and the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary we include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes in the consolidated statements of operations 

new accounting standards 

see note 2 new accounting pronouncements to the consolidated financial statements for a description of new accounting pronouncements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

at various times we use derivative financial instruments to limit exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates because derivative instruments are used solely as hedges and not for speculative trading purposes fluctuations in the market values of such derivative instruments are generally offset by reciprocal changes in the underlying economic exposures that the instruments are intended to hedge for further discussion of derivative financial instruments refer to note 14 derivatives 

currency exchange rate risk 

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks inherent in our sales commitments anticipated sales and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries we hedge future cash flows denominated in currencies other than the functional currency using sales and expense forecasts up to twelve months in advance our exposure to exchange rate risks is managed on an enterprisewide basis this strategy utilizes derivative financial instruments including option and forward contracts to hedge certain foreign currency exposures with the intent of offsetting gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposures with gains and losses on the derivative contracts hedging them we do not currently and do not intend to utilize derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes 

our operations generate nonfunctional currency cash flows such as revenue thirdparty vendor payments and intercompany payments in anticipation of these foreign currency cash flows and in view of the volatility of the currency market we enter into such foreign exchange contracts as described above to substantially mitigate our currency risk in 2019 2018 and 2017 approximately 74 percent 76 percent and 71 percent of our revenues were generated in us dollars 

we performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10 percent adverse movement in foreign exchange rates to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above as of october 31 2019 and 2018 the analysis indicated that these hypothetical market movements would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

interest rate risk 

as of october 31 2019 we had 18 billion in principal amount of senior debt outstanding the carrying amount of the fixedrate senior notes was 18 billion and the related fair value based on quoted prices was 19 billion a change in interest rates on longterm debt impacts the fair value of the company’s fixedrate longterm debt but not the company’s earnings or cash flow because the interest on such debt is fixed generally the fair market value of fixedrate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 

as of october 31 2019 a hypothetical 10 percent increase in interest rates would have decreased the fair value of the company’s fixedrate longterm debt by approximately 33 million however since the company currently has no plans to repurchase its outstanding fixedrate instruments before their maturity nor do the investors in our fixedrate debt obligations have the right to demand we pay off these obligations prior to maturity the impact of market interest rate fluctuations on the company’s fixedrate longterm debt does not affect the company’s results of operations or stockholders’ equity

at october 31 2018 our unfilled backlog was approximately 1275 million as compared to approximately 950 million at october 31 2017 consistent with our strategy we are seeing an increase in solution sales which have a longer ordertorevenue conversion cycle however we expect that a majority of the unfilled backlog will be recognized as revenue within six months while backlog on any particular date can be an indicator of shortterm revenue performance it is not necessarily a reliable indicator of medium or longterm revenue performance 

intellectual property 

we generate patent and other intellectual property rights covering significant inventions and other innovations in order to create a competitive advantage although we believe that our licenses patents and other intellectual property rights have value in general no single license patent or other intellectual property right is in itself material other than the keysight mark 

materials 

our manufacturing operations employ a wide variety of semiconductors electromechanical components and assemblies and raw materials such as plastic resins and sheet metal we purchase materials from thousands of suppliers on a global basis some of the parts that require custom design work are not readily available from alternate suppliers due to their unique design or the length of time necessary for design work our longterm relationships with suppliers allow us to proactively manage technology road maps and product discontinuance plans and monitor their financial health even so some suppliers may still extend their lead times limit supplies increase prices or cease to produce necessary parts for our solutions if these are unique components we may not be able to find a substitute quickly or at all to address the potential disruption in our supply chain we use a number of techniques including qualifying multiple sources of supply and redesign of solutions for alternative components in addition while we generally attempt to keep our inventory at minimal levels we do purchase incremental inventory as circumstances warrant to protect the supply chain 

  

environmental 

our rd manufacturing and distribution operations involve the use of hazardous substances and are regulated under international federal state and local laws governing health and safety and the environment we apply strict standards for protection of the environment and occupational health and safety to sites inside and outside the united states even if not subject to regulation imposed by foreign governments we believe that our properties and operations at our facilities comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and occupational health and safety laws however the risk of environmental liabilities cannot be completely eliminated and there can be no assurance that the application of environmental and health and safety laws will not require us to incur significant expenditures we are also regulated under a number of international federal state and local laws regarding recycling product packaging and product content requirements the environmental product contentdisposal and recycling laws are gradually becoming more stringent and may cause us to incur significant expenditures in the future 

some of our properties are undergoing remediation by hp inc hp for subsurface contaminations that were known at the time of agilent’s separation from hp in 1999 in connection with agilent’s separation from hp hp and agilent entered into an agreement pursuant to which hp agreed to retain the liability for this subsurface contamination perform the required remediation and indemnify agilent with respect to claims arising out of that contamination agilent has assigned its rights and obligations under this agreement to keysight in respect of facilities transferred to keysight in our separation from agilent on november 1 2014 the separation as a result hp has access to a limited number of our properties to perform remediation although hp agreed to minimize interference with onsite operations at such properties remediation activities and subsurface contamination may require us to incur unreimbursed costs and could harm onsite operations and the future use and value of the properties in connection with the separation agilent will indemnify us directly for any liabilities related thereto we cannot be sure that hp will continue to fulfill its remediation obligations or that agilent will continue to fulfill its indemnification obligations 

in connection with the separation agilent also agreed to indemnify us for any liability associated with contamination from past operations at all properties transferred from agilent to us we cannot be sure that agilent will fulfill its indemnification obligations 

we maintain a comprehensive environmental site liability insurance policy that may cover certain cleanup costs or legal claims related to environmental contamination this policy covers specified active inactive and divested locations

 item 1a risk factors 

risks uncertainties and other factors that may affect future results 

risks related to our business 

failure to introduce successful new solutions and services in a timely manner to address increased competition rapid technological changes and changing industry standards could result in our solutions and services becoming obsolete 

we generally sell our solutions in industries that are characterized by increased competition through frequent new solution and service introductions rapid technological changes and changing industry standards in addition many of the markets in which we operate are seasonal and cyclical without the timely introduction of new solutions services and enhancements our solutions and services will become technologically obsolete over time in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer our ability to offer new solutions and services and to deploy them in a timely manner depend on several factors including but not limited to our ability to 

 our future operating results may fluctuate significantly if our investments in innovative technologies are not as profitable as we anticipate 

on a regular basis we review the existing technologies available in the market and identify strategic new technologies to develop and invest in we are currently devoting significant resources to the 5g technology in the automotive and battery industries in the internet of things and mobile industries we are investing in rd developing relationships with customers and suppliers and redirecting our corporate and operational resources to grow within these innovative technologies our income could be harmed if we fail to gain sufficient market share if demand for our solutions is lower than we expect or if our income related to the innovative technologies is lower than we anticipate for example when the 5g standards are published we may not be able to produce a satisfactory return on investment if our strategic vision and the resources that we are spending on developing our presence in the 5g technology industry turn out to be misaligned with such standards 

failure to adjust our purchases due to changing market conditions or failure to estimate our customers demand could adversely affect our income 

our income could be harmed if we are unable to adjust our purchases to market fluctuations including those caused by the seasonal or cyclical nature of the markets in which we operate the sale of our solutions and services are dependent to a large degree on customers whose industries are subject to seasonal or cyclical trends in the demand for their products for example the consumer electronics market is particularly volatile making demand difficult to anticipate during a market upturn we may not be able to purchase sufficient supplies or components to meet increasing product demand which could materially affect our results in the past we have seen a shortage of parts for some of our products in addition some of the parts that require custom design are not readily available from alternate suppliers due to their unique design or the length of time necessary for design work should a supplier cease manufacturing such a component we would be forced to reengineer our solution in addition to discontinuing parts suppliers may also extend lead times limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors in order to secure components for the production of products we may continue to enter into noncancellable purchase commitments with vendors or at times make advance payments to suppliers which could impact our ability to adjust our inventory to declining market demands prior commitments of this type have resulted in an excess of parts when demand for electronic products has decreased if demand for our solutions is less than we expect we may experience additional excess and obsolete inventories and be forced to incur additional charges 

economic and political policies favoring national interests could adversely affect our results of operations 

our overall performance depends largely upon domestic and international economic and political conditions many of our suppliers vendors partners and other entities with whom we do business have strong ties to doing business in china and their ability to supply materials to us or otherwise work with us is strongly affected by their ability to do business in china if the us’s relationship with china deteriorates or results in trade protection measures retaliatory actions tariffs and increased barriers 

  

policies that favor domestic industries or increased import or export licensing requirements or restrictions then our operations may be adversely affected due to such changes in the economic and political ecosystem in which our suppliers vendors partners and other entities with whom we do business operate 

we have significant operations including a large number of employees manufacturing facilities and operations centers in the united states the united kingdom the european union singapore malaysia and china among other countries nationalistic economic policies and political trends in these territories such as opposition to globalization and free trade sanctions or trade restrictions withdrawal from or renegotiation of global trade agreements tax policies that favor domestic industries and interests the anticipated exit of the united kingdom from the european union known as brexit the distancing or potential exit of other countries from the european union and other similar actions may result in increased transaction costs reduced ability to hire employees reduced access to supplies and materials reduced demand or access to customers in international markets and inability to conduct our operations as they have been conducted historically each of these factors may adversely affect our business 

economic political and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our results of operations 

because we sell our solutions worldwide our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally we anticipate that revenue from international operations will continue to represent a majority of our total revenue however there can be no assurances that our international sales will continue at existing levels or grow in accordance with our effort to increase foreign market penetration in addition many of our employees contract manufacturers suppliers job functions and manufacturing facilities are located outside the united states accordingly our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors including but not limited to 

 we centralize most of our accounting processes at two locations india and malaysia these processes include general accounting inventory cost accounting accounts payable and accounts receivables functions if conditions change in those countries it may adversely affect operations including impairing our ability to pay our suppliers our results of operations as well as our liquidity may be adversely affected and possible delays may occur in reporting financial results 

further even if we are able to successfully manage the risks of international operations our business may be adversely affected if our business partners are not able to successfully manage similar risks 

our operating results and financial condition could be harmed if the markets into which we sell our solutions decline or do not grow as anticipated 

visibility into our markets is limited our quarterly sales and operating results are highly dependent on the volume and timing of technologyrelated spending and orders received during the fiscal quarter which are difficult to forecast and may be cancelled by our customers in addition our revenues and earnings forecasts for future fiscal quarters are often based on the expected seasonality or cyclicality of our markets however the markets we serve do not always experience the seasonality or cyclicality that we expect any decline in our customers markets would likely result in a reduction in demand for our solutions and services the broader semiconductor market is one of the drivers for our business and therefore a decrease in the semiconductor market could harm our business also if our customers markets decline we may not be able to collect on outstanding amounts due to us such declines could harm our financial position results of operations cash flows and stock price and could limit our profitability also in such an environment pricing pressures could intensify since a significant portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed in nature due to sales rd and manufacturing costs if we were unable to respond quickly enough these pricing pressures could further reduce our operating margins 

  

uncertainty in general economic conditions may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

our business is sensitive to negative changes in general economic conditions both inside and outside the united states global and regional economic uncertainty or depression may impact our business resulting in 

 in addition global and regional macroeconomic developments such as increased unemployment decreased income reduced access to credit volatility in capital markets decreased liquidity uncertain or destabilizing national election results in the us europe and asia and negative changes or volatility in general economic conditions in the us europe and asia could negatively affect our ability to conduct business in those territories financial difficulties experienced by our suppliers and customers including distributors due to economic volatility or negative changes could result in product delays and inventory issues economic risks related to accounts receivable could result in delays in collection and greater bad debt expense 

dependence on contract manufacturing and outsourcing other portions of our supply chain may adversely affect our ability to bring solutions to market and damage our reputation dependence on outsourced information technology and other administrative functions may impair our ability to operate effectively 

as part of our efforts to streamline operations and to cut costs we outsource aspects of our manufacturing processes and other functions and continue to evaluate additional outsourcing if our contract manufacturers or other outsourcers fail to perform their obligations in a timely manner or at satisfactory quality levels our ability to bring solutions to market and our reputation could suffer for example during a market upturn our contract manufacturers may be unable to meet our demand requirements which may preclude us from fulfilling our customers orders on a timely basis the ability of these manufacturers to perform is largely outside of our control additionally changing or replacing our contract manufacturers or other outsourcees could cause disruptions or delays in addition we outsource significant portions of our information technology it and other administrative functions since it is critical to our operations any failure of our it providers to perform could impair our ability to operate effectively in addition to the risks outlined above problems with manufacturing or it outsourcing could result in lower revenues and unrealized efficiencies and could impact our results of operations and stock price much of our outsourcing takes place in developing countries and as a result may be subject to geopolitical uncertainty 

our operating results may suffer if our manufacturing capacity does not match the demand for our solutions 

because we cannot immediately adapt our production capacity and related cost structures to rapidly changing market conditions when demand does not meet our expectations our manufacturing capacity will likely exceed our production requirements during a general market upturn or an upturn in our business we cannot increase our manufacturing capacity to meet product demand we will not be able to fulfill orders in a timely manner which could lead to order cancellations contract breaches or indemnification obligations this inability could materially and adversely limit our ability to improve our income margin and operating results by contrast if during an economic downturn we had excess manufacturing capacity then our fixed costs associated with excess manufacturing capacity would adversely affect our income margins and operating results 

key customers or large orders may expose us to additional business and legal risks that could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition  

certain key customers have substantial purchasing power and leverage in negotiating contractual arrangements with us these customers may demand contract terms that differ considerably from our standard terms and conditions large orders may also include severe contractual liabilities for us if we fail to provide the quantity and quality of product at the required delivery times while we attempt to contractually limit our potential liability under such contracts we may have to agree to some or all of these types of provisions to secure these orders and to continue to grow our business such actions expose us to significant additional risks which could result in a material adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition 

industry consolidation and consolidation among our customer base may lead to increased competition and may harm our operating results 

there is potential for industry consolidation in our markets as companies attempt to strengthen or hold their market positions in an evolving industry companies could be acquired or may be unable to continue operations companies that are strategic alliance partners in some areas of our business may acquire or form alliances with our competitors thereby reducing their business with us we believe that industry consolidation may result in stronger competitors and could lead to more variability in our operating results and could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition furthermore particularly in the communications market rapid consolidation would lead to fewer customers with the effect that loss of a major customer could have a material impact on results not anticipated in a customer marketplace composed of more numerous participants 

  

additionally if there is consolidation among our customer base our customers may be able to command increased leverage in negotiating prices and other terms of sale which could adversely affect our profitability in addition if as a result of increased leverage customer pressures require us to reduce our pricing such that our gross margins are diminished we could decide not to sell our solutions under such less favorable terms which would decrease our revenue consolidation among our customer base may also lead to reduced demand for our solutions replacement of our products by the combined entity with those of our competitors and cancellations of orders each of which could harm our operating results 

our acquisitions strategic alliances joint ventures and divestitures may result in financial results that are different than expected 

in the normal course of business we may engage in discussions with third parties relating to possible acquisitions strategic alliances joint ventures and divestitures as a result of such transactions our financial results may differ from our own or the investment communitys expectations in a given fiscal quarter or over the long term if market conditions or other factors lead us to change our strategic direction we may not realize the expected value from such transactions further such transactions often have postclosing arrangements including but not limited to postclosing adjustments transition services escrows or indemnifications the financial results of which can be difficult to predict in addition acquisitions and strategic alliances may require us to integrate a different company culture management team and business infrastructure we may have difficulty developing manufacturing and marketing the products of a newly acquired company in a way that enhances the performance of our businesses or product lines to realize the value from expected synergies depending on the size and complexity of an acquisition the successful integration of the entity depends on a variety of factors including but not limited to 

 if we do not realize the expected benefits or synergies of such transactions our consolidated financial position results of operations cash flows and stock price could be negatively impacted additionally we may record significant goodwill and other assets as a result of acquisitions or investments and we may be required to incur impairment charges which could adversely affect our consolidated financial position and results of operations 

any inability to complete acquisitions on acceptable terms could negatively impact our growth rate and financial performance 

 our ability to grow revenues earnings and cash flow depends in part upon our ability to identify and successfully acquire and integrate businesses at appropriate prices and realize anticipated synergies and business performance appropriate targets for acquisition are difficult to identify and complete for a variety of reasons including but not limited to limited due diligence high valuations business and intellectual property evaluations other interested parties negotiations of the definitive documentation satisfaction of closing conditions the need to obtain antitrust or other regulatory approvals on acceptable terms and availability of funding the inability to close appropriate acquisitions on acceptable terms could adversely impact our growth rate revenue and financial performance 

we may need additional financing in the future to meet our capital needs or to make opportunistic acquisitions and such financing may not be available on terms favorable to us if at all and may be dilutive to existing shareholders 

we may need to seek additional financing for our general corporate purposes for example we may need to increase our investment in rd activities or need funds to make acquisitions we may be unable to obtain any desired additional financing on terms favorable to us if at all if adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms we may be unable to fund our expansion successfully develop or enhance solutions or respond to competitive pressures any of which could negatively affect our business if we finance acquisitions by issuing additional convertible debt or equity securities our existing stockholders may experience share dilution which could affect the market price of our stock if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity securities our shareholders will experience dilution of their ownership interest if we raise additional funds by issuing debt we may be subject to further limitations on our operations and ability to pay dividends due to restrictive covenants 

we have outstanding debt and may incur other debt in the future which could adversely affect our financial condition liquidity and results of operations 

we currently have outstanding debt as well as availability to borrow under a revolving credit facility we may borrow additional amounts in the future and use the proceeds from any future borrowing for general corporate purposes future acquisitions expansion of our business or repurchases of our outstanding shares of common stock 

  

our incurrence of this debt and increases in our aggregate levels of debt may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition by among other things 

 our current revolving credit facility and term loan imposes restrictions on us including restrictions on our ability to create liens on our assets and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur indebtedness and requires us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios our ability to comply with these ratios may be affected by events beyond our control in addition the indenture governing our senior notes contains covenants that may adversely affect our ability to incur certain liens or engage in certain types of sale and leaseback transactions if we breach any of the covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders then subject to applicable cure periods our outstanding indebtedness could be declared immediately due and payable 

if currency exchange rates fluctuate substantially in the future our financial results could be adversely affected 

a substantial amount of our solutions are priced and paid for in us dollars although many of our solutions are priced in local currencies and a significant amount of certain types of expenses such as payroll utilities tax and marketing expenses are paid in local currencies our hedging programs are designed to reduce but not entirely eliminate within any given 12month period the impact of currency exchange rate movements including those caused by currency controls which could impact our business operating results and financial condition by resulting in lower revenue or increased expenses however for expenses beyond a 12month period our hedging strategy will not mitigate our exchange rate risk in addition our currency hedging programs involve thirdparty financial institutions as counterparties the weakening or failure of these counterparties may adversely affect our hedging programs and our financial condition through among other things a reduction in the number of available counterparties increasingly unfavorable terms or the failure of counterparties to perform under hedging contracts 

third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property rights and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling solutions or services 

third parties may claim that one or more of our solutions or services infringe their intellectual property rights we analyze and take action in response to such claims on a casebycase basis any dispute or litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and timeconsuming due to the complexity of our technology and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation and could divert our management and key personnel from business operations a claim of intellectual property infringement could cause us to enter into a costly or restrictive license agreement which may not be available under acceptable terms or at all require us to redesign certain of our solutions which would be costly and timeconsuming andor subject us to significant damages or an injunction against the development and sale of certain solutions or services in certain of our businesses we rely on thirdparty intellectual property licenses and we cannot ensure that these licenses will be available to us in the future on terms favorable to us or at all 

third parties may infringe our intellectual property rights and we may suffer competitive injury or expend significant resources enforcing our intellectual property rights 

our success depends in part on our proprietary technology including technology we obtained through acquisitions we rely on various intellectual property rights including patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets as well as confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish our proprietary rights if we do not enforce our intellectual property rights successfully our competitive position may suffer which could harm our operating results 

our pending patent copyright and trademark registration applications may not be allowed or competitors may challenge the validity or scope of our patents copyrights or trademarks in addition our patents copyrights trademarks and other intellectual property rights may not provide us with a significant competitive advantage in preparation for the separation and distribution we have applied for trademarks related to our new global brand name in various jurisdictions worldwide any successful opposition to our applications in material jurisdictions could impose material costs on us or make it more difficult to protect our brand different jurisdictions vary widely in the level of protection and priority they give to trademark and other intellectual property rights 

we may be required to spend significant resources monitoring our intellectual property rights and we may or may not be able to detect infringement of such rights by third parties our competitive position may be harmed if we cannot detect infringement and enforce our intellectual property rights in a timely manner or at all in some circumstances we may choose to not pursue enforcement due to a variety of reasons in addition competitors may avoid infringement by designing around our intellectual property rights or by developing noninfringing competing technologies intellectual property rights and our ability to enforce them may be unavailable or limited in some countries which could make it easier for competitors to capture market share and 

  

could result in lost revenues to the company furthermore some of our intellectual property is licensed to others which allows them to compete with us using that intellectual property 

if we experience a significant cybersecurity attack or disruption in our it systems our business reputation and operating results could be adversely affected 

we rely on several centralized it systems to provide solutions and services maintain financial records retain sensitive data such as intellectual property proprietary business information and data related to customers suppliers and business partners process orders manage inventory process shipments to customers and operate other critical functions the ongoing maintenance and security of this information is pertinent to the success of our business operations and our strategic goals 

despite our implementation of network security measures our network may be vulnerable to cybersecurity attacks computer viruses breakins and similar disruptions our network security measures include but are not limited to the implementation of firewalls antivirus protection patches log monitors routine backups offsite storage network audits and routine updates and modifications despite our efforts to create these security barriers we may not be able to keep pace as new threats emerge and it is virtually impossible for us to entirely eliminate this risk cybersecurity attacks are evolving and include but are not limited to malicious software attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation operating results and financial condition and no assurance can be given that our efforts to reduce the risk of such attacks will be successful 

in addition our it systems may be susceptible to damage disruptions or shutdowns due to power outages hardware failures telecommunication failures user errors catastrophes or other unforeseen events such events could result in the disruption of business processes network degradation and system downtime along with the potential that a third party will exploit our critical assets such as intellectual property proprietary business information and data related to our customers suppliers and business partners to the extent that such disruptions occur our customers and partners may lose confidence in our solutions and we may lose business or brand reputation resulting in a material and adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

we are or will be subject to ongoing tax examinations of our tax returns by the irs and other tax authorities an adverse outcome of any such audit or examination by the irs or other tax authority could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

we are or will be subject to ongoing tax examinations of our tax returns by the irs and other tax authorities in various jurisdictions we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from ongoing tax examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes these assessments can require considerable estimates and judgments intercompany transactions associated with the sale of inventory services intellectual property and cost sharing arrangements are complex and affect our tax liabilities the calculation of our tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in multiple jurisdictions the outcomes of these tax examinations could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition due to the complexity of tax contingencies the ultimate resolution of any tax matters related to operations may result in payments greater or less than amounts accrued 

our operations may be adversely impacted by changes in our business mix or changes in the tax legislative landscape 

our effective tax rate may be adversely impacted by among other things changes in the mix of our earnings among countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets and changes in tax laws we cannot give any assurance as to what our effective tax rate will be in the future because among other things there is uncertainty regarding the tax policies of the jurisdictions where we operate changes in tax laws such as tax reform in the united states or changes in tax laws resulting from the organization for economic cooperation and development’s “oecd” multijurisdictional plan of action to address “base erosion and profit shifting” and the taxation of the “digital economy” could impact our effective tax rate 

if tax laws or incentives change or cease to be in effect our income taxes could increase significantly 

we are subject to federal state and local taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions we devote significant resources to evaluating our tax positions and our worldwide provision for taxes our financial results and tax treatment are susceptible to changes in tax accounting and other laws regulations principles and interpretations in the united states and in other jurisdictions where we do business with the rise of economic and political policies that favor domestic interests it is possible that more countries will enact tax laws that either increase the tax rates or reduce or change the tax incentives available to multinational companies like ours upon a change in tax laws in any territory where we do significant business such as the us the european union or singapore we may not be able to maintain our current tax rate or qualify for or maintain the benefits of any tax incentives offered to the extent such incentives are offered 

we currently benefit from tax incentives extended to certain of our foreign subsidiaries to encourage investment or employment the most significant of which being singapore the singapore tax incentives require that specific conditions be satisfied which 

  

include achieving thresholds of employment ownership of certain assets as well as specific types of investment activities within singapore based on the current tax environment we believe that we will satisfy such conditions in the future as needed but cannot guarantee that the tax environment will not change or that such conditions will be satisfied 

our singapore tax incentives are due for renewal in fiscal 2024 but we cannot guarantee that singapore will not revoke the tax incentives earlier our taxes could increase if the existing singapore incentives are not renewed upon revocation or expiration we cannot guarantee that we will qualify for any new incentive regime that may exist in fiscal 2024 or that such conditions will be satisfied if we cannot or do not wish to satisfy all or portions of the tax incentives conditions we may lose the related tax incentives and could be required to refund the benefits that the tax incentives previously provided as a result our effective tax rate could be higher than it would have been had we maintained the benefits of the tax incentives and could harm our operating results 

our business will suffer if we are not able to retain and hire key personnel 

our future success depends partly on the continued service of our key research engineering sales marketing manufacturing executive and administrative personnel including personnel joining our company through acquisitions the markets in which we operate are dynamic and we may need to respond with reorganizations workforce reductions and site closures from time to time we believe our pay levels are competitive within the regions that we operate however there is also intense competition for certain highly technical specialties in geographic areas in which we operate and it may become more difficult to retain key employees if we fail to retain and hire a sufficient number of these personnel we may not be able to meet key objectives such as launching effective product innovations and meeting financial goals and maintain or expand our business 

if we suffer a loss to our factories facilities or distribution system due to a catastrophic event our operations could be significantly harmed 

our factories facilities and distribution system are subject to catastrophic loss due to fire flood terrorism or other natural or manmade disasters in particular several of our facilities could be subject to a catastrophic loss caused by earthquake or other natural disasters due to their locations for example our production facilities headquarters and laboratories in california and our production facilities in japan are all located in areas with aboveaverage seismic activity if any of these facilities were to experience a catastrophic loss it could disrupt our operations delay production shipments and revenue and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility if such a disruption were to occur we could breach our agreements our reputation could be harmed and our business and operating results could be adversely affected in addition since we have consolidated our manufacturing facilities we are more likely to experience an interruption to our operations in the event of a catastrophe in any one location although we carry insurance for property damage and business interruption we do not carry insurance or financial reserves for interruptions or potential losses arising from earthquakes or terrorism also our thirdparty insurance coverage will vary from time to time in both type and amount depending on availability cost and our decision with respect to risk retention economic conditions and uncertainties in global markets may adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain thirdparty insurance if our thirdparty insurance coverage is adversely affected or to the extent we have elected to selfinsure we may be at a greater risk that our operations will be harmed by a catastrophic loss 

if we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with certain regulations we may be subject to substantial negative financial consequences and civil or criminal penalties 

we and our customers are subject to various significant international federal state and local regulations including but not limited to health and safety packaging data privacy product content labor and importexport regulations these regulations are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time we may be required to incur significant expenses to comply with these regulations or to remedy violations of these regulations any failure by us to comply with applicable government regulations could also result in cessation of our operations or portions of our operations high financial penalties product recalls or impositions of fines and restrictions on our ability to carry on or expand our operations if demand for our solutions is adversely affected or our costs increase our business would suffer 

in response to changes in data privacy regulations such as the general data protection regulation “gdpr” in the european union which became effective on may 25 2018 we are modifying our data handling practices and devoting resources to keeping up with the changing regulatory environment on data privacy in the jurisdictions where we do business new laws amendments or interpretations of regulations industry standards and contractual obligations relating to privacy or data may require us to incur additional costs and restrict our business operations if we fail to comply with gdpr or other data privacy regulation we may be subject to significant financial fines and civil or criminal penalties and may suffer high damage to our reputation or brand which could adversely affect our business and financial results 

  

in addition our products and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies like the international standards organization as well as regulation by other agencies such as the us federal communications commission we also must comply with work safety rules if we fail to adequately address any of these regulations our businesses could be harmed 

failure to comply with anticorruption laws could adversely affect our business and result in financial penalties 

because we have extensive international operations we must comply with complex foreign and us laws and regulations such as the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials and anticompetition regulations although we actively maintain policies and procedures designed to ensure ongoing compliance with these laws and regulations there can be no assurance that our employees contractors or agents will not violate these policies and procedures violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties criminal sanctions restrictions on our business conduct and on our ability to offer our solutions in one or more countries and could also materially affect our brand ability to attract and retain employees international operations business and operating results 

our business and financial results may be adversely affected by various legal and regulatory proceedings 

we are subject to legal proceedings lawsuits and other claims in the normal course of business and could become subject to additional claims in the future some of which could be material the outcome of existing proceedings lawsuits and claims may differ from our expectations because the outcomes of litigation are often difficult to reliably predict various factors or developments can lead us to change current estimates of liabilities and related insurance receivables where applicable or permit us to make such estimates for matters previously not susceptible to reasonable estimates such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment a significant settlement significant regulatory developments or changes in applicable law a future adverse ruling settlement or unfavorable development could result in charges that could adversely affect our business operating results or financial condition 

our internal controls may be determined to be ineffective which may adversely affect investor confidence in our company the value of our stock and our access to capital 

the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 requires us to furnish a report by management on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting among other things we are devoting significant resources and time to comply with such internal control over financial reporting requirements however we cannot be certain that these measures will ensure that we design implement and maintain adequate control over our financial processes and reporting in the future especially in the context of acquisitions of other businesses any difficulties in the assimilation of acquired businesses into our control system could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations inferior internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our stock or on our access to capital or cause us to be subject to investigation or sanctions by the sec 

adverse conditions in the global banking industry and credit markets may adversely impact the value of our cash investments or impair our liquidity 

our cash and cash equivalents are invested or held in a mix of money market funds time deposit accounts and bank demand deposit accounts disruptions in the financial markets may in some cases result in an inability to access assets such as money market funds that traditionally have been viewed as highly liquid any failure of our counterparty financial institutions or funds in which we have invested may adversely impact our cash and cash equivalent positions and in turn our results and financial condition 

future investment returns on pension assets may be lower than expected or interest rates may decline requiring us to make significant additional cash contributions to our future plans 

we sponsor several defined benefit pension plans that cover many of our salaried and hourly employees the federal pension protection act of 2006 requires that certain capitalization levels be maintained in each of the us plans and there may be similar funding requirements in the plans outside the united states because it is unknown what the investment return on and the fair value of our pension assets will be in future years or what interest rates and discount rates may be at any point in time no assurances can be given that applicable law will not require us to make future material plan contributions any such contributions could adversely affect our financial condition 

environmental contamination from past operations could subject us to unreimbursed costs and could harm onsite operations and the future use and value of the properties involved and environmental contamination caused by ongoing operations could subject us to substantial liabilities in the future 

some of our properties are undergoing remediation by hp inc hp for subsurface contaminations that were known at the time of agilents separation from hp in 1999 in connection with agilents separation from hp hp and agilent entered into an agreement pursuant to which hp agreed to retain the liability for this subsurface contamination perform the required remediation and indemnify agilent with respect to claims arising out of that contamination agilent has assigned its rights and obligations 

  

under this agreement to keysight in respect of facilities transferred to us in the separation as a result hp will have access to a limited number of our properties to perform remediation although hp agreed to minimize interference with onsite operations at such properties remediation activities and subsurface contamination may require us to incur unreimbursed costs and could harm onsite operations and the future use and value of the properties in connection with the separation agilent will indemnify us directly for any liabilities related thereto we cannot be sure that hp will continue to fulfill its remediation obligations or that agilent will continue to fulfill its indemnification obligations 

in connection with the separation from agilent agilent also agreed to indemnify us for any liability associated with contamination from past operations at all properties transferred from agilent to keysight we cannot be sure that agilent will fulfill its indemnification obligations 

our current manufacturing processes involve the use of substances regulated under various international federal state and local laws governing the environment as a result we may become subject to liabilities for environmental contamination and these liabilities may be substantial although our policy is to apply strict standards for environmental protection at our sites inside and outside the united states even if the sites outside the united states are not subject to regulations imposed by foreign governments we may not be aware of all conditions that could subject us to liability 

risks related to our common stock 

our share price may fluctuate significantly 

our common stock is listed on nyse under the ticker symbol “keys” the market price of our common stock may fluctuate widely depending on many factors some of which may be beyond our control including but not limited to 

 stock markets in general have experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company these broad market fluctuations could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 

in addition when the market price of a company’s shares drops significantly shareholders often institute securities class action lawsuits against the company a lawsuit against us could cause us to incur substantial costs and could divert the time and attention of management and other resources 

we do not currently pay dividends on our common stock 

we do not currently pay dividends on our common stock the payment of any dividends in the future and the timing and amount thereof to our stockholders fall within the discretion of our board of directors the boards decisions regarding the payment of dividends will depend on many factors such as our financial condition earnings capital requirements debt service obligations restrictive covenants in our debt industry practice legal requirements regulatory constraints and other factors that the board deems relevant we cannot guarantee that we will pay a dividend in the future or continue to pay any dividends if we commence paying dividends 

  

certain provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and of delaware law may prevent or delay an acquisition of the company which could decrease the trading price of our common stock 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain and delaware law contains provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by making such practices or bids unacceptably expensive to the bidder and to encourage prospective acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover these provisions include but are not limited to 

 in addition because we have not chosen to be exempt from section 203 of the delaware general corporation law the dgcl this provision could also delay or prevent a change of control that some shareholders may favor section 203 provides that subject to limited exceptions persons that acquire or are affiliated with a person that acquires more than 15 percent of the outstanding voting stock of a delaware corporation an interested stockholder shall not engage in any business combination with that corporation including by merger consolidation or acquisitions of additional shares for a threeyear period following the date on which the person became an interested stockholder unless i prior to such time the board of directors of such corporation approved either the business combination or the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder ii upon consummation of the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder the interested stockholder owned at least 85 percent of the voting stock of such corporation at the time the transaction commenced excluding for purposes of determining the voting stock outstanding but not the outstanding voting stock owned by the interested stockholder the voting stock owned by directors who are also officers or held in employee benefit plans in which the employees do not have a confidential right to tender or vote stock held by the plan or iii on or subsequent to such time the business combination is approved by the board of directors of such corporation and authorized at a meeting of shareholders by the affirmative vote of at least twothirds of the outstanding voting stock of such corporation not owned by the interested stockholder 

we believe these provisions will protect our shareholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors and by providing our board of directors with more time to assess any acquisition proposal these provisions are not intended to make us immune from takeovers however these provisions will apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some shareholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that our board of directors determines is not in the best interests of the company and our shareholders these provisions may also prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates that the state courts in the state of delaware or if no state court located within the state of delaware has jurisdiction the federal court for the district of delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our shareholders which could discourage lawsuits against the company and our directors and officers 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provide that unless the board of directors otherwise determines the state courts in the state of delaware or if no state court located within the state of delaware has jurisdiction the federal court for the district of delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors or officers to the company or our shareholders any action asserting a claim against us or any of our directors or officers arising pursuant to any provision of the dgcl or keysights 

  

amended and restated certificate of incorporation or bylaws or any action asserting a claim against us or any of our directors or officers governed by the internal affairs doctrine this exclusive forum provision may limit the ability of our shareholders to bring a claim in a judicial forum that such shareholders find favorable for disputes with us or our directors or officers which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors and officers 

risks related to the acquisition of ixia 

we may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of the acquisition of ixia or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected we may also encounter significant unexpected difficulties in integrating the two businesses 

our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition of ixia the merger will depend to a large extent on our ability to integrate our and ixia’s businesses the combination of two independent businesses is a complex costly and timeconsuming process as a result we will be required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating ixia’s business practices and operations with our existing business practices and operations the integration process may disrupt the businesses and if implemented ineffectively or if impacted by unforeseen negative economic or market conditions or other factors we may not realize the full anticipated benefits of the merger our failure to meet the challenges involved in integrating the two businesses to realize the anticipated benefits of the merger could cause an interruption of or a loss of momentum in our activities and could adversely affect our results of operations 

in addition the overall integration of the businesses may result in material unanticipated problems expenses liabilities competitive responses loss of customer relationships and diversion of managements attention the difficulties of combining the operations of the companies include but are not limited to 

 many of these factors will be outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of managements time and energy which could materially impact the business financial condition and our results of operations in addition even if the operations of our business and ixia’s business are integrated successfully we may not realize the full benefits of the merger including the synergies cost savings or sales or growth opportunities that we expect these benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame or at all furthermore additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of the businesses additionally we may record significant goodwill and other assets as a result of acquisitions or investments and we may be required to incur impairment charges which could adversely affect our consolidated financial position and results of operations all of these factors could decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the merger and negatively impact us as a result we cannot be certain that the combination of our and ixia’s businesses will result in the realization of the full benefits anticipated from the merger 

risks related to the spinoff from agilent 

we are subject to continuing contingent liabilities of agilent 

after our spinoff from agilent on november 1 2014 there are several significant areas where the liabilities of agilent may become our obligations for example under the internal revenue code and the related rules and regulations each corporation that was a member of the agilent us consolidated group during a taxable period or portion of a taxable period ending on or before the effective time of the distribution is severally liable for the us federal income tax liability of the entire agilent us consolidated group for that taxable period consequently if agilent is unable to pay the consolidated us federal income tax liability for a prior period we could be required to pay the entire amount of such tax which could be substantial and in excess of the amount allocated to it as agreed between us and agilent at the time of separation other provisions of federal law establish similar liability for other matters including laws governing taxqualified pension plans as well as other contingent liabilities 

there could be significant liability if the distribution is determined to be a taxable transaction 

a condition to the spinoff is that agilent received an opinion of baker  mckenzie llp tax counsel to agilent regarding the qualification of the separation and the distribution as a reorganization within the meaning of sections 355a and 368a1d of the code the opinion relies on certain facts assumptions representations and undertakings from agilent and keysight including 

  

those regarding the past and future conduct of the companies respective businesses and other matters if any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings are incorrect or not satisfied agilent and its shareholders may not be able to rely on the opinion and could be subject to significant tax liabilities notwithstanding the opinion of tax counsel the irs could determine on audit that the distribution is taxable if it determines that any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion 

if the distribution were determined to be taxable for us federal income tax purposes agilent and its shareholders that are subject to us federal income tax could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities for example if the distribution failed to qualify for taxfree treatment agilent would for us federal income tax purposes be treated as if it had sold the keysight common stock in a taxable sale for its fair market value and agilents shareholders who are subject to us federal income tax would be treated as receiving a taxable distribution in an amount equal to the fair market value of the keysight common stock received in the distribution in addition if the separation and distribution failed to qualify for taxfree treatment under federal state and local tax law andor foreign tax law agilent and keysight could each incur significant tax liabilities under us federal state local andor foreign tax law 

under the agreement between agilent and keysight pertaining to tax matters as finalized at the time of separation we are generally required to indemnify agilent against taxes incurred by agilent that arise as a result of our taking or failing to take as the case may be certain actions that result in the distribution failing to meet the requirements of a taxfree distribution under section 355 of the code under the agreement between agilent and keysight as finalized at the time of separation we may also be required to indemnify agilent for other contingent tax liabilities which could materially adversely affect our financial position

keysight’s total orders in 2018 were 4082 million an increase of 20 percent when compared to 2017 foreign currency movements had a favorable impact of 1 percentage point on the yearoveryear comparison orders associated with acquisitions accounted for 7 percentage points of order growth for the year ended october 31 2018 when compared to 2017 total orders in 2017 were 3406 million an increase of 15 percent when compared to 2016 foreign currency movements had a negligible impact on the yearoveryear comparison orders associated with acquisitions accounted for 9 percentage points of order growth for the year ended october 31 2017 when compared to 2016 

net revenue of 3878 million for the year ended october 31 2018 increased 22 percent when compared to 2017 foreign currency movements had a favorable impact of 2 percentage points on the yearoveryear comparison revenue associated with acquisitions accounted for 6 percentage points of revenue growth for the year ended october 31 2018 when compared to 2017 revenue excluding acquisitions grew year over year with growth in all our operating segments and across all our markets net revenue of 3189 million for the year ended october 31 2017 increased 9 percent when compared to 2016 foreign currency movements had a negligible impact on the yearoveryear comparison revenue associated with acquisitions accounted for 7 percentage points of revenue growth for the year ended october 31 2017 when compared to 2016 revenue excluding acquisitions grew year over year with growth in the electronic industrial solutions group driven by semiconductor measurement and automotive and energy markets and growth in the services solutions group the communications solution group revenue was flat as gains in the commercial communications market were offset by declines in the aerospace defense and government market 

  

net income was 165 million in 2018 compared to net income of 102 million and 335 million in 2017 and 2016 respectively in 2018 2017 and 2016 we generated operating cash flows of 555 million 328 million and 420 million respectively the increase in net income for the year ended october 31 2018 when compared to 2017 was driven by higher revenue volume and a favorable tax impact from the new us tax legislation and singapore tax incentives partially offset by an unfavorable impact from a goodwill impairment charge and increases in variable peoplerelated costs the decline in net income for the year ended october 31 2017 when compared to 2016 is primarily driven by the unfavorable impact from amortization of acquisitionrelated balances 

impact of northern california wildfires 

during the week of october 8 2017 wildfires in northern california adversely impacted the keysight corporate headquarters site in santa rosa ca our headquarters was under mandatory evacuation for more than three weeks and while direct damage to our core facilities was limited our buildings did experience some smoke and other firerelated impacts cleaning and restoration efforts are largely complete and we have fully reoccupied the site keysight is insured for the damage caused by the fire 

for the years ended october 31 2018 and 2017 we recognized costs of 7 million and 16 million respectively net of estimated insurance recoveries of 90 million and 2 million respectively expenses were primarily for cleaning and restoration activities writeoff of damaged fixed assets and other direct costs related to recovery from this event 

as of october 31 2018 we have received insurance proceeds of 68 million and have a receivable of 24 million for losses and expenses for which insurance reimbursement is probable the receivable is included in other current assets in the consolidated balance sheet in addition for the year ended october 31 2018 we made investments in property plant and equipment related to fire recovery of 27 million which is expected to be covered by insurance in many cases our insurance coverage exceeds the amount of these covered losses but no gain contingencies have been recognized as our ability to realize those gains remains uncertain for financial reporting purposes we currently estimate total insurance recovery to range from 125 million to 135 million which will substantially cover our total firerelated losses expenses and investments in property plant and equipment in excess of our 10 million selfinsured retention amount there may be a difference in timing of costs incurred and the related insurance reimbursement 

outlook 

looking forward we believe our investments in rd combined with our completed acquisitions which have expanded our technology portfolio and the size of our addressable market position keysight for growth we remain focused on delivering value through differentiated and firsttomarket solutions targeted at faster growing markets where customers are investing in nextgeneration digital and electronic technologies internally we are continuously working to improve operational efficiency within and across all functions while current macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties exist related to trade tariffs monetary and fiscal policies we expect continued sales growth 

currency exchange rate exposure 

our revenues costs and expenses and monetary assets and liabilities are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our global operating and financing activities we hedge revenues expenses and balance sheet exposures that are not denominated in the functional currencies of our subsidiaries on a shortterm and anticipated basis the result of the hedging has been included in our consolidated statement of operations we experience some fluctuations within individual lines of the consolidated balance sheet and consolidated statement of operations because our hedging program is not designed to offset the currency movements in each category of revenues expenses monetary assets and liabilities our hedging program is designed to hedge currency movements on a relatively shortterm basis of up to a rolling twelvemonth period therefore we are exposed to currency fluctuations over the longer term to the extent that we are required to pay for all or portions of an acquisition price in foreign currencies we may enter into foreign exchange contracts to reduce the risk that currency movements will impact the us dollar cost of the transaction

interest expense 

interest expense for the years ended october 31 2018 and 2017 was 83 million and 80 million respectively and primarily relates to interest on our senior notes issued in october 2014 and april 2017 

income taxes 



for 2018 the effective tax rate was 140 percent which is higher than the us statutory rate primarily due to the impact of us tax law changes the singapore restructuring and tax incentive modifications completed in 2018 in response to singapore tax law changes and the tax impact of goodwill impairment the impact of the singapore restructuring includes tax benefits associated with intraentity asset transfers that were recognized in accordance with asu 201616 intraentity transfers of assets other than inventory  which we elected to early adopt effective november 1 2016 

for 2017 the effective tax rate was 43 percent which is higher than the us statutory rate primarily due to the payment of a prior year malaysia tax assessment of 68 million including tax and penalties which we are currently in the process of appealing to the special commissioners of income tax “scit” in malaysia 

for 2016 the effective tax rate was 8 percent which is lower than the us statutory rate primarily due to a higher percentage of earnings in the nonus jurisdictions taxed at lower statutory tax rates also the tax rate was lower than the us statutory rate due to a net tax benefit of 45 million resulting from the repatriation of earnings from japan which includes a us tax expense of 27 million offset by 72 million of foreign tax credits recorded in connection with the repatriation 

we benefit from tax incentives in several different jurisdictions most significantly in singapore and several jurisdictions have granted tax incentives that require renewal at various times in the future the tax incentives provide lower rates of taxation on certain classes of income and require various thresholds of investment and employment or specific types of income in those jurisdictions the tax incentives are due for renewal between 2024 and 2025 the impact of the tax incentives decreased income taxes by 567 million 49 million and 34 million in 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively the increase in the tax benefit from 2017 to 2018 is primarily due to the impact of our singapore restructuring and tax incentive modifications that were completed in 2018 in response to singapore tax law changes 

in accordance with the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes for all us and other tax jurisdictions we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes and interest will be due if our estimate of income tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment a further charge to expense would be required if events occur and the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary we include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes in the consolidated statements of operations accrued interest and penalties are included on the related tax liability line in the consolidated balance sheet 

the open tax years for the irs and most states are from november 1 2014 through the current tax year for the majority of our foreign entities the open tax years are from august 1 2014 through the current tax year for certain foreign entities the tax years remain open at most back to the year 2007 given the number of years and numerous matters that remain subject to examination in various tax jurisdictions we are unable to estimate the range of possible changes to the balance of our unrecognized tax benefits 

the company is being audited in malaysia for the 2008 tax year although this tax year predates our spinoff from agilent pursuant to the agreement between agilent and keysight pertaining to tax matters as finalized at the time of separation for certain entities including malaysia any historical tax liability is the responsibility of keysight in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 keysight paid income taxes and penalties of 68 million on gains related to intellectual property rights although we are currently in the process of appealing to the scit in malaysia the company believes there are numerous defenses to the current assessment the statute of limitations for the 2008 tax year in malaysia was closed and the income in question is exempt from tax in malaysia the company is disputing this assessment and pursuing all avenues to resolve this issue favorably for the company 

on december 22 2017 the us government enacted comprehensive federal tax legislation commonly known as the tax cuts and jobs act the “tax act” the tax act includes significant changes to the us corporate income tax system including 

  

but not limited to the transition of us international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a modified territorial tax system which will result in a onetime us tax liability on those earnings which have not previously been repatriated to the us the “transition tax” creation of new minimum taxes such as the global intangible low taxed income “gilti” tax and the base erosion antiabuse tax a federal corporate income tax rate reduction from 35 percent to 21 percent and limitations on the deductibility of interest expense and executive compensation 

the corporate tax rate reduction is effective as of january 1 2018 since the company has a fiscal year rather than a calendar year it is subject to rules relating to transitional tax rates as a result the company’s fiscal year 2018 federal statutory rate will be a blended rate of 2334 percent 

due to the complexities involved in accounting for the enactment of the tax act the sec staff has issued staff accounting bulletin 118 “sab 118” directing companies to consider the impact of the tax act as “provisional” when they do not have the necessary information available prepared or analyzed including computations in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for the change in tax law for the amounts that we were able to reasonably estimate we recognized an income tax benefit of approximately 89 million as of october 31 2018 this benefit is made up of a onetime reduction in net deferred tax liabilities and corresponding income tax benefit of approximately 304 million due to the remeasurement of us income taxes recorded on the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that were not considered permanently reinvested this was offset by approximately 205 million of income tax expense and corresponding longterm income tax payable due to the onetime transition tax we also estimated a onetime reduction in net deferred tax assets and corresponding income tax expense of approximately 10 million due to the remeasurement of the us deferred tax assets at the lower 21 percent us federal corporate income tax rate 

due to the complexity of the new tax act rules we are continuing to evaluate the gilti provisions and whether such gilti taxes are recorded as a currentperiod expense when incurred or whether such amounts should be factored into a company’s measurement of its deferred taxes 

we are continuing to evaluate the tax act and its requirements as well as its application to our business and its impact on our effective tax rate in accordance with sab 118 the estimated income tax benefit of 89 million represents our best estimate based on interpretation of the tax act we are able to make reasonable estimates of the impact of the transition tax the remeasurement of the deferred tax liability recorded on the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that were not considered reinvested the current year impact of gilti and the reduction in the us corporate income tax rate the final impact of the tax act may differ from these estimates due to among other things changes in our interpretations and assumptions based on additional guidance that may be issued by the us treasury and changes to us state conformance to the us federal tax law change in addition certain provisions of the new tax act are not applicable to keysight until fiscal year 2019 these include the foreignderived intangible income deduction “fdii” and the base erosion and antiabuse tax “beat” provisions these impacts will be included in the tax provision estimates beginning in fiscal year 2019

off balance sheet arrangements and other 

we have contractual commitments for noncancellable operating leases see note 16 commitments and contingencies to our consolidated financial statements for further information on our noncancellable operating leases 

our liquidity is affected by many factors some of which are based on normal ongoing operations of our business and some of which arise from fluctuations related to global economics and markets our cash balances are generated and held in many locations throughout the world local government regulations may restrict our ability to move cash balances to meet cash needs under certain circumstances we do not currently expect such regulations and restrictions to impact our ability to pay vendors and conduct operations throughout our global organization 

contractual commitments 

our cash flows from operations are dependent on a number of factors including fluctuations in our operating results accounts receivable collections inventory management and the timing of tax and other payments as a result the impact of contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be analyzed in conjunction with such factors 

  

the following table summarizes our total contractual obligations at october 31 2018 in millions the amounts presented in the table do not reflect 120 million of liabilities for uncertain tax positions as of october 31 2018 we are unable to accurately predict when these amounts will be realized or released however it is reasonably possible that there could be significant changes to our unrecognized tax benefits in the next 12 months due to either the expiration of a statute of limitations or a tax audit settlement 



interest on senior notes we have contractual obligations for interest payments on our senior notes interest rates and payment dates are detailed above under shortterm debt and longterm debt 

operating leases commitments under operating leases relate primarily to leasehold property see note 16 commitments and contingencies 

commitments to contract manufacturers and suppliers we purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products during the normal course of business we issue purchase orders with estimates of our requirements several months ahead of the delivery dates the reported purchase commitments represent the commitments under open purchase orders with our suppliers that have not been received however our agreements with these suppliers usually provide us with the option to cancel reschedule and adjust our requirements based on business needs prior to firm orders being placed we expect to fulfill most of our purchase commitments for inventory within one year 

in addition to the commitments to contract manufacturers and suppliers referenced above we record a liability for firm noncancellable and unconditional purchase commitments for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with our policy relating to excess inventory as of october 31 2018 the liability for our excess firm noncancellable and unconditional purchase commitments was 17 million compared to 10 million as of october 31 2017 these amounts are included in other accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet 

retirement plans commitments under the retirement plans relate to expected contributions to be made to our nonus defined benefit plans for the next year only contributions beyond the next year are impractical to estimate 

we also have benefit payments due under our defined benefit retirement plans and postretirement benefit plan that are not required to be funded in advance but are paid in the same period that benefits are provided see item 8financial statements and supplementary data note 14 retirement plans and postretirement benefit plans for additional information 

us transition tax liability the obligation for the us transition tax liability relates to the onetime us tax on those earnings which have not previously been repatriated to the us the “transition tax” keysight has elected to pay the transition tax over 8 years see item 7 managements discussion and analysis “income taxes” for additional information on the transition tax 

other purchase commitments   other purchase commitments relate to contracts with professional services suppliers we can typically cancel these contracts within 90 days without penalties for those contracts that are not cancellable within 90 days without penalties we disclose the amounts we are obligated to pay to a supplier under each contract in that period before such contract can be canceled as of october 31 2018  our contractual obligations with these suppliers was approximately 59 million within the next fiscal year as compared to approximately 42 million as of october 31 2017 

we had no material offbalance sheet arrangements as of october 31 2018 or october 31 2017 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions believed to be 

  

reasonable although these estimates are based on managements best knowledge of current events and actions that may impact the company in the future actual results may be different from the estimates an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur could materially change the financial statements our critical accounting policies are those that affect our financial statements materially and involve difficult subjective or complex judgments by management those policies are revenue recognition inventory valuation sharebased compensation retirement and postretirement plan assumptions valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets warranty loss contingencies restructuring and accounting for income taxes 

revenue recognition we enter into agreements to sell products hardware andor software services and other arrangements multipleelement arrangements that include combinations of products and services revenue from product sales net of trade discounts and allowances is recognized provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured delivery is considered to have occurred when title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer for products or when the service has been provided revenue is reduced for estimated product returns when appropriate for sales that include customerspecified acceptance criteria revenue is recognized after the acceptance criteria have been met for products that include installation if the installation meets the criteria to be considered a separate element product revenue is recognized upon delivery and recognition of installation revenue occurs when the installation is complete otherwise neither the product nor the installation revenue is recognized until the installation is complete revenue from services is deferred and recognized over the contractual period or as services are rendered we allocate revenue to each element in our multipleelement arrangements based upon their relative selling prices we determine the selling price for each deliverable based on a selling price hierarchy the selling price for a deliverable is based on our vendor specific objective evidence vsoe if available thirdparty evidence tpe if vsoe is not available or estimated selling price esp if neither vsoe nor tpe is available revenue from the sale of software products that are not required to deliver the tangible products essential functionality are accounted for under software revenue recognition rules revenue allocated to each element is then recognized when the basic revenue recognition criteria for that element have been met the amount of product revenue recognized is affected by our judgments as to whether an arrangement includes multiple elements 

we use vsoe of selling price in the selling price allocation in all instances where it exists vsoe of selling price for products and services is determined when a substantial majority of the selling prices fall within a reasonable range when sold separately tpe of selling price can be established by evaluating largely interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone sales to similarly situated customers as our products contain a significant element of proprietary technology and the solution offered differs substantially from that of competitors it is difficult to obtain the reliable standalone competitive pricing necessary to establish tpe esp represents the best estimate of the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a standalone basis we determine esp for a product or service by using historical selling prices which reflect multiple factors including but not limited to customer type geography market conditions competitive landscape gross margin objectives and pricing practices the determination of esp is made through consultation with and approval by management we may modify or develop new pricing practices and strategies in the future as these pricing strategies evolve changes may occur in esp the aforementioned factors may result in a different allocation of revenue to the deliverables in multipleelement arrangements which may change the pattern and timing of revenue recognition for these elements but will not change the total revenue recognized for the arrangement 

recent updates to revenue recognition in may 2014 the financial accounting standards board issued accounting standard update 201409 revenue from contracts with customers  which became effective for us beginning november 1 2018 for additional information on the new revenue recognition guidance and the expected impact of adoption see note 2 new accounting pronouncements to the consolidated financial statements 

inventory valuation we assess the valuation of our inventory on a periodic basis and make adjustments to the value for estimated excess and obsolete inventory based upon estimates about future demand and actual usage such estimates are difficult to make under most economic conditions the excess balance determined by this analysis becomes the basis for our excess inventory charge our excess inventory review process includes analysis of sales forecasts managing product rollovers and working with manufacturing to maximize recovery of excess inventory if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management additional writedowns may be required if actual market conditions are more favorable than anticipated inventory previously written down may be sold to customers resulting in lower cost of sales and higher income from operations than expected in that period 

sharebased compensation we account for sharebased awards in accordance with the provisions of the authoritative accounting guidance which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all sharebased payment awards made to our employees and directors the fair value of sharebased awards for employee stock option awards was estimated using the blackscholes option pricing model awards granted under the ltp program are based on a variety of targets such as total shareholder return tsr or financial metrics such as operating margin cost synergies and others the awards based on 

  

tsr were valued using a monte carlo simulation model and those based on financial metrics were valued based on the market price of keysight’s common stock on the date of grant both the blackscholes and monte carlo simulation fair value models require the use of highly subjective and complex assumptions including the option’s expected life and the price volatility of the underlying stock the estimated fair value of restricted stock awards is determined based on the market price of keysight’s common stock on the date of grant we did not grant any option awards in 2018 2017 and 2016 

retirement and postretirement benefit plan assumptions   retirement and postretirement benefit plan costs are a significant cost of doing business they represent obligations that will ultimately be settled sometime in the future and therefore are subject to estimation pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the employees average expected future service to keysight based on the terms of the plans and investment and funding decisions to estimate the impact of these future payments and our decisions concerning funding of these obligations we are required to make assumptions using actuarial concepts within the framework of accounting principles generally accepted in the us two critical assumptions are the discount rate and the expected longterm return on plan assets other important assumptions include expected future salary increases expected future increases to benefit payments expected retirement dates employee turnover retiree mortality rates and investment portfolio composition we evaluate these assumptions at least annually 

the discount rate is used to determine the present value of future benefit payments at the measurement date which is october 31 for both us and nonus plans the us discount rates as of october 31 2018 and 2017 were determined based on the results of matching expected plan benefit payments with cash flows from a hypothetically constructed bond portfolio the nonus discount rates as of october 31 2018  and 2017 were determined using spot rates along the yield curve to calculate disaggregated discount rates in addition we used this method to calculate two components of the periodic benefit cost service cost and interest cost if we changed our discount rate by 1 percent the impact would be 6 million on us net periodic benefit cost and 11 million on nonus net periodic benefit cost lower discount rates increase the present value of the liability and subsequent year pension expense higher discount rates decrease the present value of the liability and subsequent year pension expense 

the company uses alternate methods of amortization as allowed by the authoritative guidance that amortizes the actuarial gains and losses on a consistent basis for the years presented for us plans gains and losses are amortized over the average future working lifetime for most nonus plans and us postretirement benefit plans gains and losses are amortized using a separate layer for each years gains and losses the expected longterm return on plan assets is estimated using current and expected asset allocations as well as historical and expected returns plan assets are valued at fair value if we changed our estimated return on assets by 1 percent the impact would be 7 million on us net periodic benefit cost and 15 million on nonus net periodic benefit cost 

goodwill and other intangible assets   we review goodwill for impairment annually during our fourth fiscal quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable as defined in the authoritative guidance a reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment we aggregated components of an operating segment that have similar economic characteristics into our reporting units at the time of an acquisition we assign goodwill to the reporting unit that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination 

companies have the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether performing a quantitative test is necessary if an entity believes as a result of its qualitative assessment that it is morelikelythannot that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount the quantitative impairment test will be required otherwise no further testing will be required 

the guidance includes examples of events and circumstances that might indicate that a reporting units fair value is less than its carrying amount these examples include macroeconomic conditions such as deterioration in the entitys operating environment or industry or market considerations entityspecific events such as increasing costs declining financial performance or loss of key personnel or other events such as an expectation that a reporting unit will be sold or a sustained decrease in the stock price on either an absolute basis or relative to peers the qualitative indicators replace those previously used to determine whether an interim goodwill impairment test is required if it is determined as a result of the qualitative assessment that it is morelikelythannot that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount the provisions of authoritative guidance require that we perform a quantitative impairment test on goodwill 

in 2018 we performed our annual impairment test for all our reporting units based on the results of our testing the fair value of each of our reporting units exceeded the carrying value except for our isg reporting unit as a result we recorded impairment losses of 709 million for isg see note 10 goodwill and other intangible assets of the consolidated financial statements for additional information there was no impairment of goodwill during the years ended october 31 2017 and 2016 

other intangible assets consist primarily of developed technologies proprietary knowhow trademarks customer relationships noncompete agreements and backlog and are amortized using the straightline method over estimated useful lives ranging from 2  months to 10  years no impairments of purchased intangible assets were recorded during the years ended october 31 2018 2017 and 2016 

  

we review indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of these assets are no longer appropriate the authoritative accounting guidance allows a qualitative approach for testing indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment similar to the impairment testing guidance for goodwill it allows the option to first assess qualitative factors events and circumstances that could have affected the significant inputs used in determining the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset the qualitative factors assist in determining whether it is morelikelythannot that the indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired an organization may choose to bypass the qualitative assessment for any indefinitelived intangible asset in any period and proceed directly to calculating its fair value our indefinitelived intangible assets are inprocess research and development iprd intangible assets in 2018 and 2017 we assessed impairment by performing a qualitative test and recorded an impairment charge of 5 million and 7 million respectively related to the cancellation of an iprd project there were no impairments in fiscal year 2016 

warranty effective december 1 2017 keysight warranties on products sold through direct sales channels are primarily for one year warranties for products sold through distribution channels continue to be primarily for three years we accrue for standard warranty costs based on historical trends in warranty charges the accrual is reviewed regularly and periodically adjusted to reflect changes in warranty cost estimates estimated warranty charges are recorded within cost of products at the time related product revenue is recognized 

we also sell extended warranties that provide warranty coverage beyond the standard warranty term revenue associated with extended warranties is deferred and recognized over the extended coverage period 

loss contingencies as discussed in note 15 and 16 to the consolidated financial statements we are from time to time subject to a variety of litigation and similar contingent liabilities incidental to our business or the business operations of previously owned entities we recognize a liability for any contingency that is known or probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable these assessments require judgments concerning matters such as litigation developments and outcomes the anticipated outcome of negotiations the number of future claims and the cost of both pending and future claims in addition because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time liabilities may change in the future due to various factors changes in these factors could materially impact our financial position or our results of operation 

restructuring the main component of our restructuring plan is related to workforce reductions workforce reduction charges are accrued when payment of benefits becomes probable and the amounts can be estimated if the amounts and timing of cash flows from restructuring activities are significantly different from what we have estimated the actual amount of restructuring and other related charges could be materially different either higher or lower than those we have recorded 

accounting for income taxes we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits benefits and deductions and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes as well as interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period 

significant management judgment is also required in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part when it is morelikelythannot that all or some portion of specific deferred tax assets such as net operating losses or foreign tax credit carryforwards will not be realized a valuation allowance must be established for the amount of the deferred tax assets that cannot be realized we consider all available positive and negative evidence on a jurisdictionbyjurisdiction basis when assessing whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable we consider evidence such as our past operating results the existence of losses in recent years and our forecast of future taxable income at october 31 2018 the company maintains a valuation allowance mainly related to deferred tax assets for california research credits capital losses in the uk and net operating losses in the uk and netherlands we intend to maintain a valuation allowance in these jurisdictions until sufficient positive evidence exists to support their reversal 

the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax law and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions although the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes the use of a recognition and measurement model the determination of whether an uncertain tax position has met those thresholds will continue to require significant judgment by management in accordance with the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes for all us and other tax jurisdictions we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes and interest will be due the ultimate resolution of tax uncertainties may differ from what is currently estimated which could result in a material impact on income tax expense if our estimate of income tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment a further charge to expense would be required if events occur and the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being 

  

recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary we include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes in the consolidated statements of operations

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

at various times we use derivative financial instruments to limit exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates because derivative instruments are used solely as hedges and not for speculative trading purposes fluctuations in the market values of such derivative instruments are generally offset by reciprocal changes in the underlying economic exposures that the instruments are intended to hedge for further discussion of derivative financial instruments refer to note 13 derivatives 

currency exchange rate risk 

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks inherent in our sales commitments anticipated sales and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries we hedge future cash flows denominated in currencies other than the functional currency using sales and expense forecasts up to twelve months in advance our exposure to exchange rate risks is managed on an enterprisewide basis this strategy utilizes derivative financial instruments including option and forward contracts to hedge certain foreign currency exposures with the intent of offsetting gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposures with gains and losses on the derivative contracts hedging them we do not currently and do not intend to utilize derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes 

our operations generate nonfunctional currency cash flows such as revenue thirdparty vendor payments and intercompany payments in anticipation of these foreign currency cash flows and in view of the volatility of the currency market we enter into such foreign exchange contracts as described above to substantially mitigate our currency risk approximately 76 percent in 2018 and 71 percent of our revenues in each of 2017 and 2016 were generated in us dollars 

we performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10 percent adverse movement in foreign exchange rates to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above as of october 31 2018  and 2017 the analysis indicated that these hypothetical market movements would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

interest rate risk 

as of october 31 2018 we had 1800 million in principal amount of senior debt outstanding the carrying amount of the fixedrate senior notes was 1790 million and the related fair value based on quoted prices was 1802 million a change in interest rates on longterm debt impacts the fair value of the company’s fixedrate longterm debt but not the company’s earnings or cash flow because the interest on such debt is fixed generally the fair market value of fixedrate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 

as of october 31 2018 a hypothetical 10 percent increase in interest rates would have decreased the fair value of the company’s fixedrate longterm debt by approximately 37 million however since the company currently has no plans to repurchase its outstanding fixedrate instruments before their maturity nor do the investors in our fixedrate debt obligations have the right to demand we pay off these obligations prior to maturity the impact of market interest rate fluctuations on the company’s fixedrate longterm debt does not affect the company’s results of operations or stockholders’ equity

the following discussions of research and development marketing backlog intellectual property materials environmental and international operations include information common to each of our businesses 

research and development 

research and development rd expenditures were 498 million in fiscal 2017 425 million in fiscal 2016 and 387 million in fiscal 2015 we anticipate that we will continue to have significant rd expenditures in order to maintain our competitive position with a continuous flow of innovative highquality customer solutions products and services we are committed to investing in rd and have focused our development efforts on key strategic opportunities in order to align our business with available markets and position ourselves for growth 

our rd efforts focus on improvements to existing products and development to support new product introductions and complete customer solutions aligned to our industry we conduct rd in four principal areas enabling technologies system design simulation and measurement our rd seeks to improve on various technical competencies in electronics software systems and solution delivery rd investments are focused on delivering technology and solutions to market in the short term as well as building a strong foundation for future solutions over a longer time horizon 

marketing 

we have several ongoing programs to support the sale and distribution of our products and solutions and to inform existing and potential customers partners and distributors about the capabilities and benefits of our expansive product solution and service portfolio our marketing efforts promote the keysight business through participating in industry trade shows and technical conferences sponsoring technical seminars and webinars that highlight our solutions and advertising in digital media publications and physical locations additionally we write and distribute various forms of marketing collateral including brochures white papers application notes solutions briefs and articles for online and print journals finally we communicate to our existing and potential customers through our corporate website and various social media outlets such as linkedin facebook twitter and our corporate blog 

backlog 

backlog represents the amount of revenue expected from orders that have already been booked including orders for goods and services that have not been delivered to customers orders invoiced but not yet recognized as revenue and orders for goods that were shipped but not invoiced awaiting acceptance by customers 

at october 31 2017 our unfilled backlog was approximately 950 million as compared to approximately 807 million at october 31 2016 consistent with our strategy we are seeing an increase in solution sales which have a longer ordertorevenue conversion cycle however we expect that a majority of the unfilled backlog will be recognized as revenue within six months we believe backlog on any particular date while indicative of shortterm revenue performance is not necessarily a reliable indicator of medium or longterm revenue performance 

intellectual property 

we generate patent and other intellectual property rights covering significant inventions and other innovations in order to 

  

create a competitive advantage although we believe that our licenses patents and other intellectual property rights have value in general no single license patent or other intellectual property right is in itself material other than the keysight mark in addition our intellectual property rights may be challenged invalidated or circumvented or may otherwise not provide significant competitive advantage 

materials 

our manufacturing operations employ a wide variety of semiconductors electromechanical components and assemblies and raw materials such as plastic resins and sheet metal we purchase materials from thousands of suppliers on a global basis some of the parts that require custom design work are not readily available from alternate suppliers due to their unique design or the length of time necessary for design work our longterm relationships with suppliers allow us to proactively manage technology road maps and product discontinuance plans and monitor their financial health even so some suppliers may still extend their lead times limit supplies increase prices or cease to produce necessary parts for our products if these are unique components we may not be able to find a substitute quickly or at all to address the potential disruption in our supply chain we use a number of techniques including qualifying multiple sources of supply and redesign of products for alternative components in addition while we generally attempt to keep our inventory at minimal levels we do purchase incremental inventory as circumstances warrant to protect the supply chain 

environmental 

our rd manufacturing and distribution operations involve the use of hazardous substances and are regulated under international federal state and local laws governing health and safety and the environment we apply strict standards for protection of the environment and occupational health and safety to sites inside and outside the united states even if not subject to regulation imposed by foreign governments we believe that our properties and operations at our facilities comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and occupational health and safety laws however the risk of environmental liabilities cannot be completely eliminated and there can be no assurance that the application of environmental and health and safety laws will not require us to incur significant expenditures we are also regulated under a number of international federal state and local laws regarding recycling product packaging and product content requirements the environmental product contentdisposal and recycling laws are gradually becoming more stringent and may cause us to incur significant expenditures in the future 

some of our properties are undergoing remediation by hp inc hp for subsurface contaminations that were known at the time of agilent’s separation from hp in 1999 in connection with agilent’s separation from hp hp and agilent entered into an agreement pursuant to which hp agreed to retain the liability for this subsurface contamination perform the required remediation and indemnify agilent with respect to claims arising out of that contamination agilent has assigned its rights and obligations under this agreement to keysight in respect of facilities transferred to keysight in our separation from agilent on november 1 2014 the separation as a result hp has access to a limited number of our properties to perform remediation although hp agreed to minimize interference with onsite operations at such properties remediation activities and subsurface contamination may require us to incur unreimbursed costs and could harm onsite operations and the future use and value of the properties in connection with the separation agilent will indemnify us directly for any liabilities related thereto we cannot be sure that hp will continue to fulfill its remediation obligations or that agilent will continue to fulfill its indemnification obligations 

in connection with the separation agilent also agreed to indemnify us for any liability associated with contamination from past operations at all properties transferred from agilent to us we cannot be sure that agilent will fulfill its indemnification obligations 

we maintain a comprehensive environmental site liability insurance policy which may cover certain cleanup costs or legal claims related to environmental contamination this policy covers specified active inactive and divested locations 

international operations 

our net revenue originating outside the united states as a percentage of our total net revenue was approximately 67 percent in fiscal 2017 2016 and 2015 the majority of which was from customers other than foreign governments revenues from external customers are generally attributed to regions based upon the location of our sales representative 

longlived assets located outside of the united states as a percentage of our total longlived assets was approximately 66   percent in fiscal year 2017 and 57 percent in fiscal year 2016 with the increase primarily driven by acquisitions approximately 29 percent and 30 percent of our longlived assets were located in japan in fiscal years 2017 and 2016 respectively approximately 9 percent and 13 percent of our longlived assets were located in malaysia in fiscal years 2017 and 2016 respectively 

  

most of our sales in international markets are made by foreign sales subsidiaries in countries with low sales volumes sales are made through various representatives and distributors however we also sell into international markets directly from the united states 

our international business is subject to risks customarily encountered in foreign operations including interruption to transportation flows for delivery of parts to us and finished goods to our customers changes in a specific countrys or regions political or economic conditions trade protection measures import or export licensing requirements consequences from changes in tax laws and regulatory requirements difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations differing labor regulations differing protection of intellectual property and geopolitical turmoil including terrorism and war we are also exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in our sales commitments anticipated sales and expenses and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the local functional currency and may also become subject to interest rate risk inherent in any debt we incur or investment portfolios we hold there may be an increased risk of political unrest in regions where we have significant manufacturing operations such as southeast asia however we believe that our international diversification provides stability to our worldwide operations and reduces the impact on us of adverse economic changes in any single country financial information about our international operations is contained in note 20 segment information to our consolidated financial statements 

acquisition of material assets 

on april 18 2017 pursuant to the terms of an agreement and plan of merger dated january 30 2017 between keysight and ixia the merger agreement we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of ixia for 1622 million net of 72 million of cash acquired pursuant to an exchange offer for 1965 per share the merger consideration pursuant to the merger agreement any outstanding and unexercised ixia stock options with an exercise price below the merger consideration and any outstanding ixia restricted stock awards were cancelled and converted into the right to receive a cash payment equal to the merger consideration of 1965 per share minus the exercise price for the ixia stock options the vested portion of the awards associated with prior service of ixia employees represented approximately 47 million of the total consideration we funded the acquisition with a combination of cash and proceeds from debt and equity financings 

on august 31 2017 we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of scienlab for 60 million net of 2 million of cash acquired scienlab is a germanybased company that provides test solutions to automotive original equipment manufacturers and tier 1 suppliers in the automotive and energy markets this acquisition complements our portfolio allowing endtoend solutions for hybrid electric vehicles electric vehicles and battery test solutions that address emobility market dynamics we funded the acquisition using existing cash as a result of the acquisition scienlab has become a whollyowned subsidiary of keysight

 item 1a risk factors 

risks uncertainties and other factors that may affect future results 

risks related to our business 

depressed and uncertain general economic conditions may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

our business is sensitive to negative changes in general economic conditions both inside and outside the united states the continued economic downturn may adversely impact our business resulting in 

 in addition macroeconomic developments such as the recent downturn in europe the economic slowdown in asia and the results of the recent us and other national elections economic uncertainties caused by the result of the united kingdoms referendum advising for its exit from the european union could negatively affect our ability to conduct business in those geographies financial difficulties experienced by our suppliers and customers including distributors could result in product delays and inventory issues risks to accounts receivable could result in delays in collection and greater bad debt expense 

our operating results and financial condition could be harmed if the markets into which we sell our products decline or do not grow as anticipated 

visibility into our markets is limited our quarterly sales and operating results are highly dependent on the volume and timing of technologyrelated spending and orders received during the fiscal quarter which are difficult to forecast and may be cancelled by our customers in addition our revenues and earnings forecasts for future fiscal quarters are often based on the expected seasonality or cyclicality of our markets however the markets we serve do not always experience the seasonality or cyclicality that we expect any decline in our customers markets would likely result in a reduction in demand for our products and services the broader semiconductor market is one of the drivers for our business and therefore a decrease in the semiconductor market could harm our business also if our customers markets decline we may not be able to collect on outstanding amounts due to us such declines could harm our financial position results of operations cash flows and stock price and could limit our profitability also in such an environment pricing pressures could intensify since a significant portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed in nature due to sales rd and manufacturing costs if we were unable to respond quickly enough these pricing pressures could further reduce our operating margins 

if we do not introduce successful new products and services in a timely manner to address increased competition rapid technological changes and changing industry standards our products and services will become obsolete and our operating results will suffer 

we generally sell our products in industries that are characterized by increased competition through frequent new product and service introductions rapid technological changes and changing industry standards in addition many of the markets in which we operate are seasonal and cyclical without the timely introduction of new products services and enhancements our products and services will become technologically obsolete over time in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer the success of new products and services will depend on several factors including but not limited to our ability to 



  

dependence on contract manufacturing and outsourcing other portions of our supply chain may adversely affect our ability to bring products to market and damage our reputation dependence on outsourced information technology and other administrative functions may impair our ability to operate effectively 

as part of our efforts to streamline operations and to cut costs we outsource aspects of our manufacturing processes and other functions and continue to evaluate additional outsourcing if our contract manufacturers or other outsourcers fail to perform their obligations in a timely manner or at satisfactory quality levels our ability to bring products to market and our reputation could suffer for example during a market upturn our contract manufacturers may be unable to meet our demand requirements which may preclude us from fulfilling our customers orders on a timely basis the ability of these manufacturers to perform is largely outside of our control additionally changing or replacing our contract manufacturers or other outsourcees could cause disruptions or delays in addition we outsource significant portions of our information technology it and other administrative functions since it is critical to our operations any failure of our it providers to perform could impair our ability to operate effectively in addition to the risks outlined above problems with manufacturing or it outsourcing could result in lower revenues and unrealized efficiencies and could impact our results of operations and stock price much of our outsourcing takes place in developing countries and as a result may be subject to geopolitical uncertainty 

failure to adjust our purchases due to changing market conditions or failure to estimate our customers demand could adversely affect our income 

our income could be harmed if we are unable to adjust our purchases to market fluctuations including those caused by the seasonal or cyclical nature of the markets in which we operate the sale of our products and services are dependent to a large degree on customers whose industries are subject to seasonal or cyclical trends in the demand for their products for example the consumer electronics market is particularly volatile making demand difficult to anticipate during a market upturn we may not be able to purchase sufficient supplies or components to meet increasing product demand which could materially affect our results in the past we have seen a shortage of parts for some of our products in addition some of the parts that require custom design are not readily available from alternate suppliers due to their unique design or the length of time necessary for design work should a supplier cease manufacturing such a component we would be forced to reengineer our product in addition to discontinuing parts suppliers may also extend lead times limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors in order to secure components for the production of products we may continue to enter into noncancellable purchase commitments with vendors or at times make advance payments to suppliers which could impact our ability to adjust our inventory to declining market demands prior commitments of this type have resulted in an excess of parts when demand for electronic products has decreased if demand for our products is less than we expect we may experience additional excess and obsolete inventories and be forced to incur additional charges 

our operating results may suffer if our manufacturing capacity does not match the demand for our products 

because we cannot immediately adapt our production capacity and related cost structures to rapidly changing market conditions when demand does not meet our expectations our manufacturing capacity will likely exceed our production requirements if during a general market upturn or an upturn in our business we cannot increase our manufacturing capacity to meet product demand we will not be able to fulfill orders in a timely manner which could lead to order cancellations contract breaches or indemnification obligations this inability could materially and adversely limit our ability to improve our income margin and operating results by contrast if during an economic downturn we had excess manufacturing capacity then our fixed costs associated with excess manufacturing capacity would adversely affect our income margins and operating results 

industry consolidation and consolidation among our customer base may lead to increased competition and may harm our operating results 

there is potential for industry consolidation in our markets as companies attempt to strengthen or hold their market positions in an evolving industry companies could be acquired or may be unable to continue operations companies that are strategic alliance partners in some areas of our business may acquire or form alliances with our competitors thereby reducing their business with us we believe that industry consolidation may result in stronger competitors and could lead to more variability in our operating results and could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition furthermore particularly in the communications market rapid consolidation would lead to fewer customers with the effect that loss of a major customer could have a material impact on results not anticipated in a customer marketplace composed of more numerous participants 

additionally if there is consolidation among our customer base our customers may be able to command increased leverage in negotiating prices and other terms of sale which could adversely affect our profitability in addition if as a result of increased leverage customer pressures require us to reduce our pricing such that our gross margins are diminished we could decide not to sell our products under such less favorable terms which would decrease our revenue consolidation among our customer base may also lead to reduced demand for our products replacement of our products by the combined entity with those of our competitors and cancellations of orders each of which could harm our operating results 

  

economic political and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our results of operations 

because we sell our products worldwide our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally we anticipate that revenue from international operations will continue to represent a majority of our total revenue however there can be no assurances that our international sales will continue at existing levels or grow in accordance with our effort to increase foreign market penetration in addition many of our employees contract manufacturers suppliers job functions and manufacturing facilities are located outside the united states accordingly our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors including but not limited to 

 we centralize most of our accounting processes at two locations india and malaysia these processes include general accounting inventory cost accounting accounts payable and accounts receivables functions if conditions change in those countries it may adversely affect operations including impairing our ability to pay our suppliers our results of operations as well as our liquidity may be adversely affected and possible delays may occur in reporting financial results 

additionally we must comply with complex foreign and us laws and regulations such as the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials and anticompetition regulations violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties criminal sanctions restrictions on our business conduct and on our ability to offer our products in one or more countries and could also materially affect our brand ability to attract and retain employees international operations business and operating results although we actively maintain policies and procedures designed to ensure ongoing compliance with these laws and regulations there can be no assurance that our employees contractors or agents will not violate these policies and procedures 

in addition although a substantial amount of our products are priced and paid for in us dollars many of our products are priced in local currencies and a significant amount of certain types of expenses such as payroll utilities tax and marketing expenses are paid in local currencies our hedging programs are designed to reduce but not entirely eliminate within any given 12month period the impact of currency exchange rate movements including those caused by currency controls which could impact our business operating results and financial condition by resulting in lower revenue or increased expenses however for expenses beyond a 12month period our hedging strategy will not mitigate our exchange rate risk in addition our currency hedging programs involve thirdparty financial institutions as counterparties the weakening or failure of these counterparties may adversely affect our hedging programs and our financial condition through among other things a reduction in the number of available counterparties increasingly unfavorable terms or the failure of counterparties to perform under hedging contracts 

key customers or large orders may expose us to additional business and legal risks that could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition  

certain key customers have substantial purchasing power and leverage in negotiating contractual arrangements with us these customers may demand contract terms that differ considerably from our standard terms and conditions large orders may also include severe contractual liabilities for us if we fail to provide the quantity and quality of product at the required delivery times while we attempt to contractually limit our potential liability under such contracts we may have to agree to some or all of these types of provisions to secure these orders and to continue to grow our business such actions expose us to significant additional risks which could result in a material adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition 

our business will suffer if we are not able to retain and hire key personnel 

our future success depends partly on the continued service of our key research engineering sales marketing manufacturing executive and administrative personnel if we fail to retain and hire a sufficient number of these personnel we may not be able to maintain or expand our business the markets in which we operate are dynamic and we may need to respond with reorganizations workforce reductions and site closures from time to time we believe our pay levels are competitive within the regions that we 

  

operate however there is also intense competition for certain highly technical specialties in geographic areas in which we operate and it may become more difficult to retain key employees 

any inability to complete acquisitions on acceptable terms could negatively impact our growth rate and financial performance 

 our ability to grow revenues earnings and cash flow depends in part upon our ability to identify and successfully acquire and integrate businesses at appropriate prices and realize anticipated synergies and business performance appropriate targets for acquisition are difficult to identify and complete for a variety of reasons including but not limited to limited due diligence high valuations business and intellectual property evaluations other interested parties negotiations of the definitive documentation satisfaction of closing conditions the need to obtain antitrust or other regulatory approvals on acceptable terms and availability of funding the inability to close appropriate acquisitions on acceptable terms could adversely impact our growth rate revenue and financial performance 

our acquisitions strategic alliances joint ventures and divestitures may result in financial results that are different than expected 

in the normal course of business we may engage in discussions with third parties relating to possible acquisitions strategic alliances joint ventures and divestitures as a result of such transactions our financial results may differ from our own or the investment communitys expectations in a given fiscal quarter or over the long term if market conditions or other factors lead us to change our strategic direction we may not realize the expected value from such transactions further such transactions often have postclosing arrangements including but not limited to postclosing adjustments transition services escrows or indemnifications the financial results of which can be difficult to predict in addition acquisitions and strategic alliances may require us to integrate a different company culture management team and business infrastructure we may have difficulty developing manufacturing and marketing the products of a newly acquired company in a way that enhances the performance of our businesses or product lines to realize the value from expected synergies depending on the size and complexity of an acquisition the successful integration of the entity depends on a variety of factors including but not limited to 

 if we do not realize the expected benefits or synergies of such transactions our consolidated financial position results of operations cash flows and stock price could be negatively impacted 

in addition effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable and accurate financial reports and to effectively prevent fraud we are devoting significant resources and time to comply with the internal control over financial reporting requirements of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 however we cannot be certain that these measures will ensure that we design implement and maintain adequate control over our financial processes and reporting in the future especially in the context of acquisitions of other businesses any difficulties in the assimilation of acquired businesses into our control system could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations inferior internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our stock and our access to capital all of these efforts require varying levels of management resources which may divert our attention from other business operations 

we have outstanding debt and may incur other debt in the future which could adversely affect our financial condition liquidity and results of operations 

we currently have outstanding debt as well as availability to borrow under a revolving credit facility we may borrow additional amounts in the future and use the proceeds from any future borrowing for general corporate purposes future acquisitions expansion of our business or repurchases of our outstanding shares of common stock 

our incurrence of this debt and increases in our aggregate levels of debt may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition by among other things 

 our current revolving credit facility and term loan imposes restrictions on us including restrictions on our ability to create liens on our assets and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur indebtedness and requires us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios our ability to comply with these ratios may be affected by events beyond our control in addition the indenture governing our senior notes contains covenants that may adversely affect our ability to incur certain liens or engage in certain types 

  

of sale and leaseback transactions if we breach any of the covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders then subject to applicable cure periods our outstanding indebtedness could be declared immediately due and payable 

environmental contamination from past operations could subject us to unreimbursed costs and could harm onsite operations and the future use and value of the properties involved and environmental contamination caused by ongoing operations could subject us to substantial liabilities in the future 

some of our properties are undergoing remediation by hp inc hp for subsurface contaminations that were known at the time of agilents separation from hp in 1999 in connection with agilents separation from hp hp and agilent entered into an agreement pursuant to which hp agreed to retain the liability for this subsurface contamination perform the required remediation and indemnify agilent with respect to claims arising out of that contamination agilent has assigned its rights and obligations under this agreement to keysight in respect of facilities transferred to us in the separation as a result hp will have access to a limited number of our properties to perform remediation although hp agreed to minimize interference with onsite operations at such properties remediation activities and subsurface contamination may require us to incur unreimbursed costs and could harm onsite operations and the future use and value of the properties in connection with the separation agilent will indemnify us directly for any liabilities related thereto we cannot be sure that hp will continue to fulfill its remediation obligations or that agilent will continue to fulfill its indemnification obligations 

in connection with the separation from agilent agilent also agreed to indemnify us for any liability associated with contamination from past operations at all properties transferred from agilent to keysight we cannot be sure that agilent will fulfill its indemnification obligations 

our current manufacturing processes involve the use of substances regulated under various international federal state and local laws governing the environment as a result we may become subject to liabilities for environmental contamination and these liabilities may be substantial although our policy is to apply strict standards for environmental protection at our sites inside and outside the united states even if the sites outside the united states are not subject to regulations imposed by foreign governments we may not be aware of all conditions that could subject us to liability 

we and our customers are subject to various governmental regulations compliance with which may cause us to incur significant expenses and if we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with certain regulations we may be forced to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution and we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties 

we and our customers are subject to various significant international federal state and local regulations including but not limited to health and safety packaging product content labor and importexport regulations these regulations are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time we may be required to incur significant expenses to comply with these regulations or to remedy violations of these regulations any failure by us to comply with applicable government regulations could also result in cessation of our operations or portions of our operations product recalls or impositions of fines and restrictions on our ability to carry on or expand our operations if demand for our products is adversely affected or our costs increase our business would suffer 

our products and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies like the international standards organization as well as regulation by other agencies such as the us federal communications commission we also must comply with work safety rules if we fail to adequately address any of these regulations our businesses could be harmed 

third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property rights and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products or services 

from time to time third parties may claim that one or more of our products or services infringe their intellectual property rights we analyze and take action in response to such claims on a casebycase basis any dispute or litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and timeconsuming due to the complexity of our technology and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation and could divert our management and key personnel from business operations a claim of intellectual property infringement could cause us to enter into a costly or restrictive license agreement which may not be available under acceptable terms or at all require us to redesign certain of our products which would be costly and timeconsuming andor subject us to significant damages or an injunction against the development and sale of certain products or services in certain of our businesses we rely on thirdparty intellectual property licenses and we cannot ensure that these licenses will be available to us in the future on terms favorable to us or at all 

  

third parties may infringe our intellectual property rights and we may suffer competitive injury or expend significant resources enforcing our intellectual property rights 

our success depends in part on our proprietary technology including technology we obtained through acquisitions we rely on various intellectual property rights including patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets as well as confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish our proprietary rights if we do not enforce our intellectual property rights successfully our competitive position may suffer which could harm our operating results 

our pending patent copyright and trademark registration applications may not be allowed or competitors may challenge the validity or scope of our patents copyrights or trademarks in addition our patents copyrights trademarks and other intellectual property rights may not provide us with a significant competitive advantage in preparation for the separation and distribution we have applied for trademarks related to our new global brand name in various jurisdictions worldwide any successful opposition to our applications in material jurisdictions could impose material costs on us or make it more difficult to protect our brand different jurisdictions vary widely in the level of protection and priority they give to trademark and other intellectual property rights 

we may be required to spend significant resources monitoring our intellectual property rights and we may or may not be able to detect infringement of such rights by third parties our competitive position may be harmed if we cannot detect infringement and enforce our intellectual property rights in a timely manner or at all in some circumstances we may choose to not pursue enforcement due to a variety of reasons in addition competitors may avoid infringement by designing around our intellectual property rights or by developing noninfringing competing technologies intellectual property rights and our ability to enforce them may be unavailable or limited in some countries which could make it easier for competitors to capture market share and could result in lost revenues to the company furthermore some of our intellectual property is licensed to others which allows them to compete with us using that intellectual property 

we are or will be subject to ongoing tax examinations of our tax returns by the irs and other tax authorities an adverse outcome of any such audit or examination by the irs or other tax authority could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

we are or will be subject to ongoing tax examinations of our tax returns by the irs and other tax authorities in various jurisdictions we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from ongoing tax examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes these assessments can require considerable estimates and judgments intercompany transactions associated with the sale of inventory services intellectual property and cost sharing arrangements are complex and affect our tax liabilities the calculation of our tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in multiple jurisdictions the outcomes of any tax examinations could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition due to the complexity of tax contingencies the ultimate resolution of any tax matters related to operations may result in payments greater or less than amounts accrued 

our operations may be adversely impacted by changes in our business mix or changes in the tax legislative landscape 

our effective tax rate may be adversely impacted by among other things changes in the mix of our earnings among countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets and changes in tax laws we cannot give any assurance as to what our effective tax rate will be in the future because among other things there is uncertainty regarding the tax policies of the jurisdictions where we operate changes in tax laws such as tax reform in the united states or changes in tax laws resulting from the organization for economic cooperation and development’s “oecd” multijurisdictional plan of action to address “base erosion and profit shifting” and the taxation of the “digital economy” could impact our effective tax rate 

if tax incentives change or cease to be in effect our income taxes could increase significantly 

we benefit from tax incentives extended to certain of our foreign subsidiaries to encourage investment or employment several jurisdictions have granted us tax incentives that require renewal at various times in the future the most significant being singapore we do not expect incentives granted by other jurisdictions to have a material impact on our financial statements the singapore tax incentive requires that specific conditions be satisfied which include achieving thresholds of employment ownership of certain assets as well as specific types of investment activities within singapore we believe that we will satisfy such conditions in the future as needed but cannot guarantee that such conditions will be satisfied our singapore tax incentive is due for renewal in fiscal 2024 but we cannot guarantee that singapore will not revoke the tax incentive earlier 

       singapore announced potential changes to its ip incentive programs in its 2017 budget such potential changes could result in a reduction in tax incentive benefits and an early termination of or changes to our existing singapore incentive in 2021 no changes have been finalized and it is unclear to what extent if at all changes will be made to the tax incentives or any specific conditions we cannot guarantee that we will qualify for any new incentive regime or that such conditions will be satisfied 

  

our taxes could increase if the incentives are not renewed upon revocation or expiration if we cannot or do not wish to satisfy all or portions of the tax incentive conditions we may lose the related tax incentive and could be required to refund the benefits that the tax incentives previously provided as a result our effective tax rate could be higher than it would have been had we maintained the benefits of the tax incentives and could harm our operating results 

if we suffer a loss to our factories facilities or distribution system due to a catastrophic event our operations could be significantly harmed 

our factories facilities and distribution system are subject to catastrophic loss due to fire flood terrorism or other natural or manmade disasters in particular several of our facilities could be subject to a catastrophic loss caused by earthquake or other natural disasters due to their locations for example our production facilities headquarters and laboratories in california and our production facilities in japan are all located in areas with aboveaverage seismic activity if any of these facilities were to experience a catastrophic loss it could disrupt our operations delay production shipments and revenue and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility if such a disruption were to occur we could breach our agreements our reputation could be harmed and our business and operating results could be adversely affected in addition since we have consolidated our manufacturing facilities we are more likely to experience an interruption to our operations in the event of a catastrophe in any one location although we carry insurance for property damage and business interruption we do not carry insurance or financial reserves for interruptions or potential losses arising from earthquakes or terrorism also our thirdparty insurance coverage will vary from time to time in both type and amount depending on availability cost and our decision with respect to risk retention economic conditions and uncertainties in global markets may adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain thirdparty insurance if our thirdparty insurance coverage is adversely affected or to the extent we have elected to selfinsure we may be at a greater risk that our operations will be harmed by a catastrophic loss 

if we experience a significant disruption in or breach in security of our information technology systems our business could be adversely affected 

we rely on several centralized information technology systems to provide products and services maintain financial records process orders manage inventory process shipments to customers and operate other critical functions if we experience a prolonged system disruption in the information technology systems that involve our interactions with customers or suppliers it could result in the loss of sales and customers and significant incremental costs which could adversely affect our business in addition our information technology systems may be susceptible to damage disruptions or shutdowns due to power outages hardware failures computer viruses attacks by computer hackers telecommunication failures user errors catastrophes or other unforeseen events furthermore security breaches of our information technology systems could result in the misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to the company or our employees partners customers or suppliers which could result in significant financial or reputational damage to the company 

manmade problems such as cybersecurity attacks computer viruses or terrorism may disrupt our operations and harm our business reputation and operating results 

despite our implementation of network security measures our network may be vulnerable to cybersecurity attacks computer viruses breakins and similar disruptions cybersecurity attacks in particular are evolving and include but are not limited to malicious software attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

our daily business operations require us to retain sensitive data such as intellectual property proprietary business information and data related to customers suppliers and business partners within our networking infrastructure the ongoing maintenance and security of this information is pertinent to the success of our business operations and our strategic goals and organizations like keysight are susceptible to multiple variations of attacks on our networks on a daily basis 

our networking infrastructure and related assets may be subject to unauthorized access by hackers employee errors or other unforeseen activities such issues could result in the disruption of business processes network degradation and system downtime along with the potential that a third party will exploit our critical assets such as intellectual property proprietary business information and data related to our customers suppliers and business partners to the extent that such disruptions occur they may cause delays in the manufacture or shipment of our products and the cancellation of customer orders and as a result our business operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected resulting in a possible loss of business or brand reputation 

in addition the effects of war or acts of terrorism could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition the continued threat of terrorism and heightened security and military action in response to this threat or any future acts of terrorism may cause further disruption to the economy and create further uncertainties in the economy energy shortages such as gas or electricity shortages could have similar negative impacts to the extent that such disruptions or uncertainties result in delays or cancellations of customer orders or the manufacture or shipment of our products our business operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

  

our business and financial results may be adversely affected by various legal and regulatory proceedings 

we are subject to legal proceedings lawsuits and other claims in the normal course of business and could become subject to additional claims in the future some of which could be material the outcome of existing proceedings lawsuits and claims may differ from our expectations because the outcomes of litigation are often difficult to reliably predict various factors or developments can lead us to change current estimates of liabilities and related insurance receivables where applicable or permit us to make such estimates for matters previously not susceptible to reasonable estimates such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment a significant settlement significant regulatory developments or changes in applicable law a future adverse ruling settlement or unfavorable development could result in charges that could adversely affect our business operating results or financial condition 

we have substantial cash requirements in the united states although most of our cash is generated outside of the united states the failure to maintain a level of cash sufficient to address our cash requirements in the united states could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

although the cash generated in the united states from our operations including any cash and nonpermanently invested earnings repatriated to the united states is expected to cover our normal operating requirements and debt service requirements a substantial amount of additional cash may be required for special purposes such as the maturity of our current and future debt obligations any dividends that may be declared any future stock repurchase programs and any acquisitions if we encounter a significant need for liquidity domestically that we cannot fulfill through borrowings equity offerings or other internal or external sources the transfer of cash into the united states may incur an overall tax rate higher than our tax rates have been in the past and negatively impact aftertax earnings 

we may need additional financing in the future to meet our capital needs or to make opportunistic acquisitions and such financing may not be available on terms favorable to us if at all and may be dilutive to existing shareholders 

we may need to seek additional financing for our general corporate purposes for example we may need to increase our investment in rd activities or need funds to make acquisitions we may be unable to obtain any desired additional financing on terms favorable to us if at all if adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms we may be unable to fund our expansion successfully develop or enhance products or respond to competitive pressures any of which could negatively affect our business if we finance acquisitions by issuing additional convertible debt or equity securities our existing stockholders may experience share dilution which could affect the market price of our stock if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity securities our shareholders will experience dilution of their ownership interest if we raise additional funds by issuing debt we may be subject to further limitations on our operations and ability to pay dividends due to restrictive covenants 

adverse conditions in the global banking industry and credit markets may adversely impact the value of our cash investments or impair our liquidity 

our cash and cash equivalents are invested or held in a mix of money market funds time deposit accounts and bank demand deposit accounts disruptions in the financial markets may in some cases result in an inability to access assets such as money market funds that traditionally have been viewed as highly liquid any failure of our counterparty financial institutions or funds in which we have invested may adversely impact our cash and cash equivalent positions and in turn our results and financial condition 

future investment returns on pension assets may be lower than expected or interest rates may decline requiring us to make significant additional cash contributions to our future plans 

we sponsor several defined benefit pension plans that cover many of our salaried and hourly employees the federal pension protection act of 2006 requires that certain capitalization levels be maintained in each of the us plans and there may be similar funding requirements in the plans outside the united states because it is unknown what the investment return on and the fair value of our pension assets will be in future years or what interest rates and discount rates may be at any point in time no assurances can be given that applicable law will not require us to make future material plan contributions any such contributions could adversely affect our financial condition 

risks related to our common stock 

our share price may fluctuate significantly 

our common stock is listed on nyse under the ticker symbol “keys” the market price of our common stock may fluctuate widely depending on many factors some of which may be beyond our control including but not limited to 



  

 stock markets in general have experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company these broad market fluctuations could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 

in addition when the market price of a company’s shares drops significantly shareholders often institute securities class action lawsuits against the company a lawsuit against us could cause us to incur substantial costs and could divert the time and attention of management and other resources 

we do not currently pay dividends on our common stock 

we do not currently pay dividends on our common stock the payment of any dividends in the future and the timing and amount thereof to our stockholders fall within the discretion of our board of directors the boards decisions regarding the payment of dividends will depend on many factors such as our financial condition earnings capital requirements debt service obligations restrictive covenants in our debt industry practice legal requirements regulatory constraints and other factors that the board deems relevant we cannot guarantee that we will pay a dividend in the future or continue to pay any dividends if we commence paying dividends 

certain provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and of delaware law may prevent or delay an acquisition of the company which could decrease the trading price of our common stock 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain and delaware law contains provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by making such practices or bids unacceptably expensive to the bidder and to encourage prospective acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover these provisions include but are not limited to 



  

in addition because we have not chosen to be exempt from section 203 of the delaware general corporation law the dgcl this provision could also delay or prevent a change of control that some shareholders may favor section 203 provides that subject to limited exceptions persons that acquire or are affiliated with a person that acquires more than 15 of the outstanding voting stock of a delaware corporation an interested stockholder shall not engage in any business combination with that corporation including by merger consolidation or acquisitions of additional shares for a threeyear period following the date on which the person became an interested stockholder unless i prior to such time the board of directors of such corporation approved either the business combination or the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder ii upon consummation of the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder the interested stockholder owned at least 85 of the voting stock of such corporation at the time the transaction commenced excluding for purposes of determining the voting stock outstanding but not the outstanding voting stock owned by the interested stockholder the voting stock owned by directors who are also officers or held in employee benefit plans in which the employees do not have a confidential right to tender or vote stock held by the plan or iii on or subsequent to such time the business combination is approved by the board of directors of such corporation and authorized at a meeting of shareholders by the affirmative vote of at least twothirds of the outstanding voting stock of such corporation not owned by the interested stockholder 

we believe these provisions will protect our shareholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors and by providing our board of directors with more time to assess any acquisition proposal these provisions are not intended to make us immune from takeovers however these provisions will apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some shareholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that our board of directors determines is not in the best interests of the company and our shareholders these provisions may also prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates that the state courts in the state of delaware or if no state court located within the state of delaware has jurisdiction the federal court for the district of delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our shareholders which could discourage lawsuits against the company and our directors and officers 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provide that unless the board of directors otherwise determines the state courts in the state of delaware or if no state court located within the state of delaware has jurisdiction the federal court for the district of delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors or officers to the company or our shareholders any action asserting a claim against us or any of our directors or officers arising pursuant to any provision of the dgcl or keysights amended and restated certificate of incorporation or bylaws or any action asserting a claim against us or any of our directors or officers governed by the internal affairs doctrine this exclusive forum provision may limit the ability of our shareholders to bring a claim in a judicial forum that such shareholders find favorable for disputes with us or our directors or officers which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors and officers 

risks related to the acquisition of ixia 

we may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of the merger or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected we may also encounter significant unexpected difficulties in integrating the two businesses 

our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the merger will depend to a large extent on our ability to integrate our and ixia’s businesses the combination of two independent businesses is a complex costly and timeconsuming process as a result we will be required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating ixia’s business practices and operations with our existing business practices and operations the integration process may disrupt the businesses and if implemented ineffectively or if impacted by unforeseen negative economic or market conditions or other factors we may not realize the full anticipated benefits of the merger our failure to meet the challenges involved in integrating the two businesses to realize the anticipated benefits of the merger could cause an interruption of or a loss of momentum in our activities and could adversely affect our results of operations 

in addition the overall integration of the businesses may result in material unanticipated problems expenses liabilities competitive responses loss of customer relationships and diversion of managements attention the difficulties of combining the operations of the companies include but are not limited to 



  

 

many of these factors will be outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of managements time and energy which could materially impact the business financial condition and our results of operations in addition even if the operations of our business and ixia’s business are integrated successfully we may not realize the full benefits of the merger including the synergies cost savings or sales or growth opportunities that we expect these benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame or at all furthermore additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of the businesses all of these factors could decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the merger and negatively impact us as a result we cannot be certain that the combination of our and ixia’s businesses will result in the realization of the full benefits anticipated from the merger 

uncertainties associated with the merger may cause a loss of employees and may otherwise materially adversely affect the future business and operations of the combined company 

the combined company’s success after the merger will depend in part upon the ability of the combined company to retain executive officers and key employees in some of the fields in which we and ixia operate there are only a limited number of people in the job market who possess the requisite skills and it may be increasingly difficult for the combined company to hire personnel over time 

current and prospective employees of each company may experience uncertainty about their roles with the combined company following the merger in addition key employees may depart because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain with the combined company following the merger the loss of services of any key personnel or the inability to hire new personnel with the requisite skills could restrict the ability of the combined company to develop new products or enhance existing products in a timely manner to sell products to customers or to manage the business of the combined company effectively also the business financial condition and results of operations of the combined company could be materially adversely affected by the loss of any of its key employees by the failure of any key employee to perform in his or her current position or by the combined company’s inability to attract and retain skilled employees 

we and ixia will incur direct and indirect costs as a result of the merger 

we and ixia will incur substantial expenses in connection with and as a result of completing the merger and over a period of time following the completion of the merger we further expect to incur substantial expenses in connection with coordinating our businesses operations policies and procedures and ixia’s while we have assumed that a certain level of transaction expenses will be incurred factors beyond our control could affect the total amount or the timing of these expenses many of the expenses that will be incurred by their nature are difficult to estimate accurately 

risks related to the separation 

we will be subject to continuing contingent liabilities of agilent following the separation 

after the separation there are several significant areas where the liabilities of agilent may become our obligations for example under the internal revenue code and the related rules and regulations each corporation that was a member of the agilent us consolidated group during a taxable period or portion of a taxable period ending on or before the effective time of the distribution is severally liable for the us federal income tax liability of the entire agilent us consolidated group for that taxable period consequently if agilent is unable to pay the consolidated us federal income tax liability for a prior period we could be required to pay the entire amount of such tax which could be substantial and in excess of the amount allocated to it as agreed between us and agilent at the time of separation other provisions of federal law establish similar liability for other matters including laws governing taxqualified pension plans as well as other contingent liabilities 

there could be significant liability if the distribution is determined to be a taxable transaction 

a condition to the distribution is that agilent received an opinion of baker  mckenzie llp tax counsel to agilent regarding the qualification of the separation and the distribution as a reorganization within the meaning of sections 355a and 368a1d of the code the opinion relies on certain facts assumptions representations and undertakings from agilent and keysight including those regarding the past and future conduct of the companies respective businesses and other matters if any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings are incorrect or not satisfied agilent and its shareholders may not be able to rely on the opinion and could be subject to significant tax liabilities notwithstanding the opinion of tax counsel the irs could determine 

  

on audit that the distribution is taxable if it determines that any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion 

if the distribution were determined to be taxable for us federal income tax purposes agilent and its shareholders that are subject to us federal income tax could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities for example if the distribution failed to qualify for taxfree treatment agilent would for us federal income tax purposes be treated as if it had sold the keysight common stock in a taxable sale for its fair market value and agilents shareholders who are subject to us federal income tax would be treated as receiving a taxable distribution in an amount equal to the fair market value of the keysight common stock received in the distribution in addition if the separation and distribution failed to qualify for taxfree treatment under federal state and local tax law andor foreign tax law agilent and keysight could each incur significant tax liabilities under us federal state local andor foreign tax law 

under the agreement between agilent and keysight pertaining to tax matters as finalized at the time of separation we are generally required to indemnify agilent against taxes incurred by agilent that arise as a result of our taking or failing to take as the case may be certain actions that result in the distribution failing to meet the requirements of a taxfree distribution under section 355 of the code under the agreement between agilent and keysight as finalized at the time of separation we may also be required to indemnify agilent for other contingent tax liabilities which could materially adversely affect our financial position

years ended october 31 2017 2016 and 2015 

keysight’s total orders in 2017 were 3406 million an increase of 15 percent when compared to 2016 foreign currency movements had a negligible impact on the yearoveryear comparison orders associated with acquisitions accounted for 9 percentage points of order growth for the year ended october 31 2017 when compared to 2016 total orders in 2016 were 2953 million an increase of 3 percent when compared to 2015 foreign currency movements had an unfavorable impact of 1 percent on the yearoveryear comparison orders associated with acquisitions accounted for 5 percentage points of order growth for the year ended october 31 2016 when compared to 2015 

net revenue of 3189 million for the year ended october 31 2017 increased 9 percent when compared to 2016 foreign currency movements had a negligible impact on the yearoveryear comparison revenue associated with acquisitions accounted for 7 percentage points of revenue growth for the year ended october 31 2017 when compared to 2016 excluding acquisitions revenue grew yearoveryear with growth in the electronic industrial solutions group driven by semiconductor measurement and automotive and energy markets and growth in the services solutions group the communications solution group revenue was 

  

flat as gains in the commercial communications market were offset by declines in the aerospace defense and government market net revenue of 2918 million in 2016 increased 2 percent when compared to 2015 foreign currency movements had no impact on the yearoveryear comparison the revenue increase associated with acquisitions accounted for approximately 5 percentage points for the year ended october 31 2016 when compared to 2015 excluding acquisitions revenue declined yearoveryear as weakness in the smartphone supply chain and restructuring and consolidation activities in the industry offset strength in 5g technologies and data center expansion 

net income was 102 million in 2017 compared to net income of 335 million and 513 million in 2016 and 2015 respectively in 2017 2016 and 2015 we generated operating cash flows of 313 million 416 million and 376 million respectively the decline in net income for the year ended october 31 2017 is primarily driven by the unfavorable impact from amortization of acquisitionrelated balances 

in fiscal 2015 we initiated a phased program associated with our separation from agilent to resize and optimize our infrastructure from the one that had been established to serve a diversified technology company the focus of the first phase of the program was on the it infrastructure to support finance sales and human resources the second phase of the program which was initiated in the third quarter of fiscal 2016 primarily addressed the optimization of the it infrastructure to support the services business we recognized costs related to this program of 20 million 24 million and 20 million in the years ended october 31 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively we expect to recognize additional costs estimated to range from 2 million to 3 million through fiscal 2018 

impact of northern california wildfires 

during the week of october 8 2017 wildfires in northern california adversely impacted the keysight corporate headquarters site in santa rosa ca our headquarters was under mandatory evacuation for more than three weeks and while direct damage to our core facilities was limited our buildings did experience some smoke and other firerelated impacts cleaning and additional restoration efforts are ongoing in both production and nonproduction areas of the site to ensure business continuity the company has leased temporary office space that will support santa rosa employees who are not immediately reoccupying the site keysight is insured for the damage caused by the fire including business interruption insurance and though we do not expect the fire to have a net impact on our business results the disruption will impact the seasonality of revenue in the first half of fiscal 2018 

for the three and twelve months ended october 31 2017 we recognized costs of 16 million net of 2 million of estimated insurance recovery including the writeoff of damaged fixed assets unabsorbed overhead costs cleaning and other direct costs related to the impact of this event 

as we are still in the investigation phase we have only recognized an insurance receivable for known losses for which we believe insurance reimbursement is probable in excess of our selfinsured retention amount of 10 million in many cases our insurance coverage exceeds the amount of these covered losses but no gain contingencies have been recognized as our ability to realize those gains remains uncertain for financial reporting purposes we currently estimate that total losses and expenses related to the fire will range from 80 million to 110 million primarily including cleaning and recovery costs and believe that the expenses will be recoverable under our insurance policy there may be a difference in timing of costs incurred and the related insurance reimbursement 

outlook 

looking forward we believe our increased investments in rd combined with our completed acquisitions which have expanded of our technology portfolio and the size of our addressable market positions keysight for growth we remain focused on delivering value through innovative solutions targeted at faster growing markets where customers are investing in nextgeneration digital and electronic technologies internally we are continuously working to improve operational efficiency within and across all functions 

  

currency exchange rate exposure 

our revenues costs and expenses and monetary assets and liabilities are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our global operating and financing activities we hedge revenues expenses and balance sheet exposures that are not denominated in the functional currencies of our subsidiaries on a shortterm and anticipated basis the result of the hedging has been included in our consolidated statement of operations we experience some fluctuations within individual lines of the consolidated balance sheet and consolidated statement of operations because our hedging program is not designed to offset the currency movements in each category of revenues expenses monetary assets and liabilities our hedging program is designed to hedge currency movements on a relatively shortterm basis of up to a rolling twelvemonth period therefore we are exposed to currency fluctuations over the longer term to the extent that we are required to pay for all or portions of an acquisition price in foreign currencies we may enter into foreign exchange contracts to reduce the risk that currency movements will impact the us dollar cost of the transaction 

  

results from operationsyears ended october 31 2017 2016 and 2015 

orders and net revenue 

in general recorded orders represent firm purchase commitments from our customers with established terms and conditions for products and services that will be delivered within six months consistent with our strategy we are seeing an increase in solution sales which have a longer ordertorevenue conversion cycle however the majority of recorded orders will be delivered within six months 

revenue reflects the delivery and acceptance of the products and services as defined on the customer’s terms and conditions cancellations are recorded in the period received from the customer and historically have not been material

net revenue 

the following table provides the percent change in revenue for the years ended october 31 2017 and 2016 by geographic region including and excluding the impact of currency changes as compared to the respective prior year 



net revenue of 3189 million for the year ended october 31 2017 increased 9 percent when compared to 2016 foreign currency movements had a negligible impact on the yearoveryear comparison revenue associated with acquisitions accounted for 7 percentage points of revenue growth for the year ended october 31 2017 when compared to 2016 net revenue of 2918 million for the year ended october 31 2016 increased 2 percent when compared to 2015 foreign currency movements 

  

had a negligible impact on the yearoveryear comparison revenue associated with acquisitions accounted for 5 percentage points of revenue growth for the year ended october 31 2016 when compared to 2015 

revenue from the communications solutions group represented approximately 54 percent of total revenue in 2017 and was flat when compared to 2016 the communications solutions group contribution to total revenue growth was negligible in 2017 with growth in japan and asia pacific excluding japan offset by declines in the americas and europe when compared to 2016 the communications solutions group revenue remained flat as strength in 5g technologies and data center technologies was offset by decline in the aerospace defense and government market in 2016 the communications solutions group represented approximately 60 percent of total revenue and increased 3 percent when compared to 2015 the communications solutions group contributed 1 percentage point to total revenue growth in 2016 with growth in europe japan and asia pacific excluding japan while the americas revenue was flat when compared to 2015 excluding revenue from anite the communications solutions group revenue declined yearoveryear as weakness in the smartphone supply chain and restructuring and consolidation activities in the industry offset strength in 5g technologies and data center expansion 

revenue from the electronic industrial solutions group represented approximately 27 percent of total revenue in 2017 and grew 8 percent yearoveryear when compared to the same period last year driven by strong growth in semiconductor measurement and automotive and energy markets the electronic industrial solutions group contributed 2 percentage points to total revenue growth in 2017 with growth in asia pacific excluding japan and europe partially offset by declines in japan while revenue from the americas remained flat revenue from the electronic industrial solutions group represented approximately 26 percent of total revenue in 2016 and grew 2 percent yearoveryear when compared to the same period last year the electronic industrial solutions group contributed 1 percentage point to total revenue growth in 2016 with growth in asia pacific excluding japan and japan partially offset by declines in europe and the americas 

revenue from the ixia solutions group represented approximately 6 percent of total revenue in 2017 revenue from the ixia solutions group contributed 7 percentage points to total revenue growth in 2017 

revenue from the services solutions group represented approximately 13 percent of total revenue in 2017 and grew 4 percent when compared yearoveryear the services solutions group contribution to the total revenue growth was negligible in 2017 with growth in all regions revenue from the services solutions group represented approximately 14 percent of total revenue in 2016 and was flat when compared yearoveryear the services solutions group contribution to total revenue growth was negligible in 2016 with growth in the americas and japan partially offset by decline in asia pacific excluding japan while europe was flat 

backlog 

backlog represents the amount of revenue expected from orders that have already been booked including orders for goods and services that have not been delivered to customers orders invoiced but not yet recognized as revenue and orders for goods that were shipped but not invoiced awaiting acceptance by customers 

at october 31 2017 our unfilled backlog was approximately 950 million as compared to approximately 807 million at october 31 2016 consistent with our strategy we are seeing an increase in solution sales which have a longer ordertorevenue conversion cycle however we expect that a majority of the unfilled backlog will be recognized as revenue within six months we believe backlog on any particular date while indicative of shortterm revenue performance is not necessarily a reliable indicator of medium or longterm revenue performance 

  

costs and expenses 





gross margin declined 2 percentage points in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily driven by the unfavorable impacts from amortization of acquisitionrelated assets firerelated costs at our corporate headquarters an increase in peoplerelated costs and an increase in warranty expense due to a lower compare as a result of a onetime reduction in the standard warranty accrual during the three months ended july 31 2016 gross margin remained flat in 2016 compared to 2015 as the favorable impacts from a higher percentage of revenue from software and rd solutions lower inventory and warranty charges were offset by unfavorable impacts from acquisitionrelated intangible amortization 

excess and obsolete inventory charges were 16 million in 2017 17 million in 2016 and 28 million in 2015 sales of previously writtendown inventory were 1 million in 2017 2 million in 2016 and 2 million in 2015 

research and development expense increased 17 percent in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily driven by the addition of ixia to the cost structure an increase in peoplerelated costs acquisitionrelated compensation costs and our continued investment in research and development programs as a percentage of total revenue research and development expenses increased 1 percentage point to 16 percent in 2017 from 15 percent in 2016 research and development expense increased 10 percent in 2016 compared to 2015 due to increased expenses associated with acquired companies and our continued investment in research and development programs as a percentage of total revenue research and development expenses increased 1 percentage point to 15 percent in 2016 from 14 percent in 2015 we expect investment in research and development to continue at current levels and have focused our development efforts on strategic growth opportunities 

selling general and administrative expenses increased 28 percent for 2017 compared to the same period last year primarily driven by the addition of ixia to our cost structure increases in amortization of acquisitionrelated assets acquisition and integration costs acquisitionrelated compensation costs investments in sales resources peoplerelated costs and the unfavorable impact from firerelated costs at our corporate headquarters and restructuringrelated costs selling general and administrative expenses increased 4 percent for 2016 compared to the same period last year primarily driven by increased expenses associated with acquired companies higher field selling costs higher intangible amortization and higher separationrelated costs partially offset by the favorable impact from foreign currency movements and lower sharebased compensation expense 

other operating expense income net for 2017 was income of 84 million which primarily includes a 68 million gain from a settlement related to our japan pension fund and rental income other operating expense income net for 2016 was income of 25 million which primarily includes rental income 

operating margin decreased 6 percentage points in 2017 when compared to 2016 primarily driven by increases in amortization of acquisitionrelated assets acquisition and integration costs investments in sales resources and peoplerelated costs partially offset by favorable impact from higher revenue and revenue mix operating margin decreased 1 percentage point in 2016 when compared to 2015 primarily driven by the impacts of acquisitionrelated intangible amortization higher integration costs and the addition of the anite cost structure partially offset by favorable impacts from foreign currency movements and lower sharebased compensation expense 

as of october 31 2017 our headcount was approximately 12600 compared to 10300 in 2016 the increase is primarily driven by acquisition of ixia 

  

interest expense 

interest expense for the year ended october 31 2017 and 2016 was 80 million and 47 million respectively and relates to interest on our senior notes issued in october 2014 and april 2017 the increase in interest expense for the year ended october 31 2017 is primarily due to costs related to a bridge loan facility that expired in april interest expense and amortization of debt issuance costs on 700 million of senior notes issued in april 2017 and new borrowings under a senior unsecured term loan and revolving credit facility the new debt issuances provided partial funding for the acquisition of ixia 

income taxes 



for 2017 the effective tax rate was 43 percent which is higher than the us statutory rate primarily due to the payment of a prior year malaysia tax assessment of 68 million including tax and penalties which we are currently in the process of appealing to the special commissioners of income tax “scit” in malaysia 

for 2016 the effective tax rate was 8 percent which is lower than the us statutory rate primarily due to a higher percentage of earnings in the nonus jurisdictions taxed at lower statutory tax rates also the tax rate was lower than the us statutory rate due to the net tax benefit of 45 million resulting from the repatriation of earnings from japan which includes a us tax expense of 27 million offset by 72 million of foreign tax credits recorded in connection with the repatriation 

for 2015 the effective tax rate was a benefit of 32 percent which is lower than the us statutory rate primarily due to the retroactive benefit of two tax incentives in singapore approved during 2015 also the tax rate was lower than the us statutory rate due to a higher percentage of earnings in the nonus jurisdictions taxed at lower statutory tax rates 

we benefit from tax incentives in several different jurisdictions most significantly in singapore and several jurisdictions have granted tax incentives that require renewal at various times in the future the tax incentives provide lower rates of taxation on certain classes of income and require various thresholds of investment and employment or specific types of income in those jurisdictions the tax incentives are due for renewal between 2024 and 2025 the impact of the tax incentives decreased income taxes by 49 million 34 million and 250 million in 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively 

in accordance with the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes for all us and other tax jurisdictions we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes and interest will be due if our estimate of income tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment a further charge to expense would be required if events occur and the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary we include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes in the consolidated statements of operations accrued interest and penalties are included on the related tax liability line in the consolidated balance sheet 

for the majority of our entities the open tax years for the irs state and most foreign audit authorities are from august 1 2014 through the current tax year for certain foreign entities the tax years generally remain open at most back to the year 2007 given the number of years and numerous matters that remain subject to examination in various tax jurisdictions we are unable to estimate the range of possible changes to the balance of our unrecognized tax benefits 

the company is being audited in malaysia for the 2008 tax year although this tax year predates our spinoff from agilent pursuant to the agreement between agilent and keysight pertaining to tax matters as finalized at the time of separation for certain entities including malaysia any historical tax liability is the responsibility of keysight in the fourth quarter of this year keysight paid income taxes and penalties of 68 million on gains related to intellectual property rights although we are currently in the process of appealing to the special commissioners of income tax “scit” in malaysia the company believes there are numerous defenses to the current assessment the statute of limitations for the 2008 tax year in malaysia is closed and the income in question is exempt from tax in malaysia the company is disputing this assessment and pursuing all avenues to resolve this issue favorably for the company 

on december 15 2017 the conference committee comprised of representatives of both the us house of representatives and the us senate approved proposed us tax reform legislation entitled tax cuts and jobs act the tax cuts and jobs act will become law if passed by both the us house of representatives and the us senate and signed by the us president if this tax 

  

reform is enacted as currently drafted it will have numerous impacts on our financial statements for example we would expect impacts to tax expense deferred tax assets and liabilities these impacts would primarily result from the proposed deemed repatriation of foreign earnings as well as the proposed reduction in the us corporate tax rate in addition the current version of the tax cuts and jobs act contains numerous complex provisions impacting us multinational companies and we continue to review and assess the proposed legislative language and its potential impact to keysight 

segment overview 

in fiscal 2016 we completed an organizational change to align our organization with the industries we serve which resulted in three reportable operating segments communications solutions group electronic industrial solutions group and services solutions group the communications solutions group serves customers spanning the worldwide commercial communications end market which includes internet infrastructure and the aerospace defense and government end market the electronic industrial solutions group provides test and measurement solutions across a broad set of electronic industrial end markets the services solutions group provides repair calibration and consulting services and remarkets used keysight equipment on april 18 2017 we completed the acquisition of ixia which became our fourth reportable segment the ixia solutions group “isg” the group provides testing visibility and security solutions strengthening applications across physical and virtual networks for enterprises service providers and network equipment manufacturers in addition our global team of experts provides startup assistance consulting optimization and application support across all of our end markets

services solutions group 

the services solutions group provides repair calibration and consulting services and remarkets used keysight equipment in addition to providing repair and calibration support for keysight equipment we also calibrate nonkeysight equipment the group serves the same markets as keysight’s communications solutions and electronic industrial solutions groups providing industryspecific services to deliver complete keysight solutions and help customers reduce their total cost of ownership for their design and test equipment this segment was formerly reported as the company’s customer support and services segment 

net revenue 



the services solutions group revenue in 2017 grew 4 percent compared to 2016 acquisitions accounted for approximately 1 percentage point of total revenue growth an increase in revenue from sales of used equipment and calibration services was partially offset by a decline in revenue from repair services revenue grew in all regions led by strong growth in asia pacific excluding japan and the americas services solutions group revenue in 2016 remained flat compared to 2015 acquisitions accounted for approximately 2 percentage points of total revenue growth an increase in revenue from calibration services and used equipment was partially offset by a decline in revenue from repair services growth in the americas and japan was partially offset by a decline in asia pacific excluding japan while europe remained flat 

gross margin and operating margin 

the following table shows the services solutions group margins expenses and income from operations for 2017  versus 2016  and 2016  versus 2015  





gross margin in 2017 was flat compared to 2016 primarily driven by higher volume and favorable revenue mix offset by higher expenses associated with the investments we are making in additional capacity to expand our multivendor calibration and asset management services gross margin in 2016 decreased 2 percentage points compared to 2015 primarily driven by flat volume 

  

and higher expenses associated with the investments we are making in additional capacity to expand our multivendor calibration and asset management services 

research and development expenses for the services solutions group represent the segment’s share of centralized investment research and development expenses declined 67 percent when compared to 2016 and declined 40 percent in 2016 when compared to 2015 primarily driven by a change in the services solutions group’s share of centralized investments in research and development 

for 2017 selling general and administrative expense increased 7 percent compared to 2016 due to increased investment in sales resources higher peoplerelated costs and acquisitions selling general and administrative expense increased 5 percent in 2016 compared to 2015 due to higher field selling costs an increase in infrastructurerelated costs and acquisitions

income from operations 

income from operations for 2017 increased 5 million on a corresponding revenue increase of 17 million income from operations for 2016 decreased 9 million on a corresponding revenue increase of 1 million 

operating margin increased 1 percentage point in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily driven by higher revenue and lower share in rd expenses partially offset by increased investment in sales resources operating margin decreased 2 percentage points in 2016 compared to 2015 driven by flat revenue lower gross margins higher infrastructurerelated costs and field selling costs 

financial condition 

liquidity and capital resources 

our financial position as of october 31 2017 consisted of cash and cash equivalents of 818 million as compared to 783 million as of october 31 2016

we believe our cash and cash equivalents cash generated from operations and ability to access capital markets and credit lines will satisfy for at least the next twelve months our liquidity requirements both globally and domestically including the following working capital needs capital expenditures business acquisitions contractual obligations commitments principal and interest payments on debt and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations 

 net cash provided by operating activities 

cash flows from operating activities can fluctuate significantly from period to period as working capital needs and the timing of payments for income taxes restructuring activities pension funding variable pay and other items impact reported cash flows

in 2015 we invested 7 million in preferred stock of a privately held radio frequency microstructure company accounted for using the cost method 

net cash used in financing activities 

cash flows related to financing activities consist primarily of cash flows associated with the issuance of common stock proceeds from and repayments of borrowings issuance of common stock under employee stock plans treasury stock repurchases and debt issuance cost net cash provided by financing activities in 2017 was 1440 million compared to cash used of 25 million in 2016 and cash used of 19 million in 2015 primarily due to proceeds used to fund the acquisition of ixia including the issuance of longterm debt of 1069 million shortterm borrowings of 212 million and the issuance of common stock under public offering of 444 million net of issuance costs we repaid 323 million of the borrowings in 2017 including 182 million of the revolving facility 140 million of the term loan and a 1 million shortterm loan acquired with the acquisition of scienlab in addition during 2017 we issued common stock under employee stock plans of 51 million compared to 43 million during 2016 and 26 million during 2015

off balance sheet arrangements and other 

we have contractual commitments for noncancellable operating leases see note 17 commitments and contingencies to our consolidated financial statements for further information on our noncancellable operating leases 

our liquidity is affected by many factors some of which are based on normal ongoing operations of our business and some of which arise from fluctuations related to global economics and markets our cash balances are generated and held in many locations throughout the world local government regulations may restrict our ability to move cash balances to meet cash needs under certain circumstances we do not currently expect such regulations and restrictions to impact our ability to pay vendors and conduct operations throughout our global organization 

  

contractual commitments 

our cash flows from operations are dependent on a number of factors including fluctuations in our operating results accounts receivable collections inventory management and the timing of tax and other payments as a result the impact of contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be analyzed in conjunction with such factors 

the following table summarizes our total contractual obligations at october 31 2017 in millions the amounts presented in the table do not reflect 41 million of liabilities for uncertain tax positions as of october 31 2017 we are unable to accurately predict when these amounts will be realized or released however it is reasonably possible that there could be significant changes to our unrecognized tax benefits in the next 12 months due to either the expiration of a statute of limitations or a tax audit settlement 



interest on senior notes we have contractual obligations for interest payments on our senior notes interest rates and payment dates are detailed above under longterm debt 

operating leases commitments under operating leases relate primarily to leasehold property see note 17 commitments and contingencies 

commitments to contract manufacturers and suppliers we purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products during the normal course of business we issue purchase orders with estimates of our requirements several months ahead of the delivery dates our agreements with these suppliers usually provide us with the option to cancel reschedule and adjust our requirements based on business needs prior to firm orders being placed purchase orders outstanding with delivery dates within 30 days are typically noncancellable the majority of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements are firm noncancellable and unconditional commitments we expect to fulfill most of our purchase commitments for inventory within one year 

in addition to the commitments to contract manufacturers and suppliers referenced above we record a liability for firm noncancellable and unconditional purchase commitments for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with our policy relating to excess inventory as of october 31 2017 the liability for our excess firm noncancellable and unconditional purchase commitments was 10 million compared to 9 million as of october 31 2016 these amounts are included in other accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet 

retirement plans commitments under the retirement plans relate to expected contributions to be made to our nonus defined benefit plans for the next year only contributions beyond the next year are impractical to estimate 

we also have benefit payments due under our defined benefit retirement plans and postretirement benefit plan that are not required to be funded in advance but are paid in the same period that benefits are provided see item 8financial statements and supplementary data note 15 retirement plans and postretirement benefit plans for additional information 

other purchase commitments   other purchase commitments relate to contracts with professional services suppliers we can typically cancel these contracts within 90 days without penalties for those contracts that are not cancellable within 90 days without penalties we disclose the amounts we are obligated to pay to a supplier under each contract in that period before such contract can be canceled as of october 31 2017  our contractual obligations with these suppliers was approximately 42 million within the next fiscal year as compared to approximately 35 million as of october 31 2016 

we had no material offbalance sheet arrangements as of october 31 2017 or october 31 2016 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable although these estimates are based on managements best knowledge of current events and actions that may impact the company in the future actual results may be different from the estimates an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur could materially change the financial statements our critical accounting policies are those that affect our financial statements materially and involve difficult subjective or complex judgments by management those policies are revenue recognition inventory valuation sharebased compensation retirement and postretirement plan assumptions valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets warranty restructuring and accounting for income taxes 

revenue recognition we enter into agreements to sell products hardware andor software services and other arrangements multipleelement arrangements that include combinations of products and services revenue from product sales net of trade discounts and allowances is recognized provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured delivery is considered to have occurred when title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer for products or when the service has been provided revenue is reduced for estimated product returns when appropriate for sales that include customerspecified acceptance criteria revenue is recognized after the acceptance criteria have been met for products that include installation if the installation meets the criteria to be considered a separate element product revenue is recognized upon delivery and recognition of installation revenue occurs when the installation is complete otherwise neither the product nor the installation revenue is recognized until the installation is complete revenue from services is deferred and recognized over the contractual period or as services are rendered we allocate revenue to each element in our multipleelement arrangements based upon their relative selling prices we determine the selling price for each deliverable based on a selling price hierarchy the selling price for a deliverable is based on our vendor specific objective evidence vsoe if available thirdparty evidence tpe if vsoe is not available or estimated selling price esp if neither vsoe nor tpe is available revenue from the sale of software products that are not required to deliver the tangible products essential functionality are accounted for under software revenue recognition rules revenue allocated to each element is then recognized when the basic revenue recognition criteria for that element have been met the amount of product revenue recognized is affected by our judgments as to whether an arrangement includes multiple elements 

we use vsoe of selling price in the selling price allocation in all instances where it exists vsoe of selling price for products and services is determined when a substantial majority of the selling prices fall within a reasonable range when sold separately tpe of selling price can be established by evaluating largely interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone sales to similarly situated customers as our products contain a significant element of proprietary technology and the solution offered differs substantially from that of competitors it is difficult to obtain the reliable standalone competitive pricing necessary to establish tpe esp represents the best estimate of the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a standalone basis we determine esp for a product or service by using historical selling prices which reflect multiple factors including but not limited to customer type geography market conditions competitive landscape gross margin objectives and pricing practices the determination of esp is made through consultation with and approval by management we may modify or develop new pricing practices and strategies in the future as these pricing strategies evolve changes may occur in esp the aforementioned factors may result in a different allocation of revenue to the deliverables in multipleelement arrangements which may change the pattern and timing of revenue recognition for these elements but will not change the total revenue recognized for the arrangement 

inventory valuation we assess the valuation of our inventory on a periodic basis and make adjustments to the value for estimated excess and obsolete inventory based upon estimates about future demand and actual usage such estimates are difficult to make under most economic conditions the excess balance determined by this analysis becomes the basis for our excess inventory charge our excess inventory review process includes analysis of sales forecasts managing product rollovers and working with manufacturing to maximize recovery of excess inventory if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management additional writedowns may be required if actual market conditions are more favorable than anticipated inventory previously written down may be sold to customers resulting in lower cost of sales and higher income from operations than expected in that period 

sharebased compensation we account for sharebased awards in accordance with the provisions of the authoritative accounting guidance which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all sharebased payment awards made to our employees and directors the fair value of sharebased awards for employee stock option awards was estimated using the blackscholes option pricing model awards granted under the ltp program are based on a variety of targets such as total shareholder return tsr or financial metrics such as operating margin cost synergies and others the awards based on tsr 

  

were valued using a monte carlo simulation model and those based on financial metrics were valued based on the market price of keysight’s common stock on the date of grant both the blackscholes and monte carlo simulation fair value models require the use of highly subjective and complex assumptions including the option’s expected life and the price volatility of the underlying stock the estimated fair value of restricted stock awards is determined based on the market price of keysight’s common stock on the date of grant we did not grant any option awards in 2017 and 2016 for the year ended october 31 2015 we used the average historical volatility of eleven  peer companies to estimate the volatility for our stock option awards we considered our ability to find traded options of peer companies in the current market with similar terms and prices to our options in estimating the expected life of our options we considered the historical option exercise behavior of our executives which we believe is representative of future behavior 

retirement and postretirement benefit plan assumptions   retirement and postretirement benefit plan costs are a significant cost of doing business they represent obligations that will ultimately be settled sometime in the future and therefore are subject to estimation pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the employees average expected future service to keysight based on the terms of the plans and investment and funding decisions to estimate the impact of these future payments and our decisions concerning funding of these obligations we are required to make assumptions using actuarial concepts within the framework of accounting principles generally accepted in the us two critical assumptions are the discount rate and the expected longterm return on plan assets other important assumptions include expected future salary increases expected future increases to benefit payments expected retirement dates employee turnover retiree mortality rates and investment portfolio composition we evaluate these assumptions at least annually 

the discount rate is used to determine the present value of future benefit payments at the measurement date which is october 31 for both us and nonus plans the us discount rates as of october 31 2017 and 2016 were determined based on the results of matching expected plan benefit payments with cash flows from a hypothetically constructed bond portfolio the nonus discount rates as of october 31 2017  and 2016 were determined using spot rates along the yield curve to calculate disaggregated discount rates in addition we used this method to calculate two components of the periodic benefit cost service cost and interest cost if we changed our discount rate by 1 percent the impact would be 4 million on us net periodic benefit cost and 7 million on nonus net periodic benefit cost lower discount rates increase the present value of the liability and subsequent year pension expense higher discount rates decrease the present value of the liability and subsequent year pension expense 

the company uses alternate methods of amortization as allowed by the authoritative guidance that amortizes the actuarial gains and losses on a consistent basis for the years presented for us plans gains and losses are amortized over the average future working lifetime for most nonus plans and us postretirement benefit plans gains and losses are amortized using a separate layer for each years gains and losses the expected longterm return on plan assets is estimated using current and expected asset allocations as well as historical and expected returns plan assets are valued at fair value if we changed our estimated return on assets by 1 percent the impact would be 6 million on us net periodic benefit cost and 13 million on nonus net periodic benefit cost 

goodwill and other intangible assets   we review goodwill for impairment annually during our fourth fiscal quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable as defined in the authoritative guidance a reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment we aggregated components of an operating segment that have similar economic characteristics into our reporting units at the time of an acquisition we assign goodwill to the reporting unit that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination 

companies have the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether performing the twostep quantitative test is necessary if an entity believes as a result of its qualitative assessment that it is morelikelythannot that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount the quantitative impairment test will be required otherwise no further testing will be required 

the guidance includes examples of events and circumstances that might indicate that a reporting units fair value is less than its carrying amount these examples include macroeconomic conditions such as deterioration in the entitys operating environment or industry or market considerations entityspecific events such as increasing costs declining financial performance or loss of key personnel or other events such as an expectation that a reporting unit will be sold or a sustained decrease in the stock price on either an absolute basis or relative to peers the qualitative indicators replace those previously used to determine whether an interim goodwill impairment test is required if it is determined as a result of the qualitative assessment that it is morelikelythannot that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount the provisions of authoritative guidance require that we perform a twostep impairment test on goodwill in the first step we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value the second step if necessary measures the amount of impairment by applying fairvaluebased tests to the individual assets and liabilities within each reporting unit 

in 2016 we implemented changes in our organizational structure designed to align our organization with the industries we 

  

serve which resulted in the formation of three reportable operating segments that are also our reporting units on april 18 2017 we completed the acquisition of ixia which became our fourth reportable operating segment in 2017 we assessed goodwill impairment by performing a qualitative test for our four reporting units based on the results of our testing it was determined that it is morelikelythannot that the fair values of the reporting units are greater than their carrying values there was no impairment of goodwill during the years ended october 31 2017 2016 and 2015 each quarter we review the events and circumstances to determine if goodwill impairment is indicated 

other intangible assets consist primarily of developed technologies proprietary knowhow trademarks customer relationships noncompete agreements and backlog and are amortized using the straightline method over estimated useful lives ranging from 3  months to 10  years no impairments of purchased intangible assets were recorded during the years ended october 31 2017 2016 and 2015 

we review other intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of these assets are no longer appropriate the authoritative accounting guidance allows a qualitative approach for testing indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment similar to the impairment testing guidance for goodwill it allows the option to first assess qualitative factors events and circumstances that could have affected the significant inputs used in determining the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset the qualitative factors assist in determining whether it is morelikelythannot that the indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired an organization may choose to bypass the qualitative assessment for any indefinitelived intangible asset in any period and proceed directly to calculating its fair value our indefinitelived intangible assets are inprocess research and development iprd intangible assets in 2017 we assessed impairment by performing a qualitative test and recorded an impairment charge of 7 million related to the cancellation of an iprd project there were no impairments in fiscal years 2016 and 2015 

warranty our standard warranty term for most of our products from the date of delivery is typically three years we accrue for standard warranty costs based on historical trends in warranty charges the accrual is reviewed regularly and periodically adjusted to reflect changes in warranty cost estimates estimated warranty charges are recorded within cost of products at the time related product revenue is recognized 

we also sell extended warranties that provide warranty coverage beyond the standard warranty term revenue associated with extended warranties is deferred and recognized over the extended coverage period 

restructuring the main component of our restructuring plan is related to workforce reductions workforce reduction charges are accrued when payment of benefits becomes probable and the amounts can be estimated if the amounts and timing of cash flows from restructuring activities are significantly different from what we have estimated the actual amount of restructuring and other related charges could be materially different either higher or lower than those we have recorded 

accounting for income taxes we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits benefits and deductions and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes as well as interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period 

significant management judgment is also required in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part when it is morelikelythannot that all or some portion of specific deferred tax assets such as net operating losses or foreign tax credit carryforwards will not be realized a valuation allowance must be established for the amount of the deferred tax assets that cannot be realized we consider all available positive and negative evidence on a jurisdictionbyjurisdiction basis when assessing whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable we consider evidence such as our past operating results the existence of losses in recent years and our forecast of future taxable income at october 31 2017 the company maintains a valuation allowance mainly related to deferred tax assets for capital losses in the uk california research credits and net operating losses in the uk and netherlands we intend to maintain a valuation allowance in these jurisdictions until sufficient positive evidence exists to support their reversal 

we have provided for all us federal income and foreign withholding taxes on the undistributed earnings of some of our foreign subsidiaries for the portion of earnings we do not intend to reinvest permanently for the amount of foreign earnings that we consider reinvested permanently should we decide to remit this income to the us in a future period our provision for income taxes will increase materially in that period 

the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax law and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions although the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes the use of a recognition and measurement model the determination of whether an uncertain tax position has met those thresholds will continue to require significant judgment by management in accordance with the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income 

  

taxes for all us and other tax jurisdictions we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes and interest will be due the ultimate resolution of tax uncertainties may differ from what is currently estimated which could result in a material impact on income tax expense if our estimate of income tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment a further charge to expense would be required if events occur and the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary we include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes in the consolidated statements of operations

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

at various times we use derivative financial instruments to limit exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates because derivative instruments are used solely as hedges and not for speculative trading purposes fluctuations in the market values of such derivative instruments are generally offset by reciprocal changes in the underlying economic exposures that the instruments are intended to hedge for further discussion of derivative financial instruments refer to note 13 derivatives 

currency exchange rate risk 

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks inherent in our sales commitments anticipated sales and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries we hedge future cash flows denominated in currencies other than the functional currency using sales and expense forecasts up to twelve months in advance our exposure to exchange rate risks is managed on an enterprisewide basis this strategy utilizes derivative financial instruments including option and forward contracts to hedge certain foreign currency exposures with the intent of offsetting gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposures with gains and losses on the derivative contracts hedging them we do not currently and do not intend to utilize derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes 

our operations generate nonfunctional currency cash flows such as revenue thirdparty vendor payments and intercompany payments in anticipation of these foreign currency cash flows and in view of the volatility of the currency market we enter into such foreign exchange contracts as described above to substantially mitigate our currency risk approximately 71 percent of our revenues in 2017 and 2016 and 75 percent of our revenues in 2015 were generated in us dollars 

we performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10 percent adverse movement in foreign exchange rates to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above as of october 31 2017  and 2016 the analysis indicated that these hypothetical market movements would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

interest rate risk 

as of october 31 2017 we had 2060 million in principal amount of senior debt outstanding the carrying amount of the fixedrate senior notes was 1799 million and the related fair value based on quoted prices was 1890 million a change in interest rates on longterm debt impacts the fair value of the company’s fixedrate longterm debt but not the company’s earnings or cash flow because the interest on such debt is fixed generally the fair market value of fixedrate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 

as of october 31 2017 a hypothetical 10 percent increase in interest rates would have decreased the fair value of the company’s fixedrate longterm debt by approximately 36 million however since the company currently has no plans to repurchase its outstanding fixedrate instruments before their maturity nor do the investors in our fixedrate debt obligations have the right to demand we pay off these obligations prior to maturity the impact of market interest rate fluctuations on the company’s fixedrate longterm debt does not affect the company’s results of operations or stockholders’ equity

the following discussions of research and development backlog intellectual property materials environmental and international operations include information common to each of our businesses 

research and development 

research and development rd expenditures were 387 million in fiscal 2015 361 million in fiscal 2014 and 375 million in fiscal 2013 we anticipate that we will continue to have significant rd expenditures in order to maintain our competitive position with a continuous flow of innovative highquality products and services we are committed to investing in rd and have focused our development efforts on key strategic opportunities in order to align our business with available markets and position ourselves to grow in our markets 

       our rd efforts focus on potential new products and product improvements covering a wide variety of technologies we conduct rd in four principal areas applied rd in enabling technologies communications simulation and measurement our rd seeks to improve on various technical competencies in electronics software systems and solutions in each of these rd fields we conduct rd that is focused on specific product development for release in the shortterm as well as other rd that is intended to be the foundation for future products over a longer time horizon product development rd investments support new product introductions improvements to existing products and development of products to meet future market opportunities 

  

backlog 

backlog represents the amount of revenue expected from orders that have already been booked including orders for goods and services that have not been delivered to customers orders invoiced but not yet recognized as revenue and orders for goods that were shipped but not invoiced awaiting acceptance by customers 

at october 31 2015 our unfilled backlog was approximately 779 million as compared to approximately 781 million at october 31 2014 we expect that a majority of the unfilled backlog will be recognized as revenue within six months on average our backlog represents approximately three months of revenue we believe backlog on any particular date while indicative of shortterm revenue performance is not necessarily a reliable indicator of medium or longterm revenue performance 

intellectual property 

we generate patent and other intellectual property rights covering significant inventions and other innovations in order to create a competitive advantage although we believe that our licenses patents and other intellectual property rights have value in general no single license patent or other intellectual property right is in itself material other than the keysight mark in addition our intellectual property rights may be challenged invalidated or circumvented or may otherwise not provide significant competitive advantage 

materials 

our manufacturing operations employ a wide variety of semiconductors electromechanical components and assemblies and raw materials such as plastic resins and sheet metal we purchase materials from thousands of suppliers on a global basis some of the parts that require custom design work are not readily available from alternate suppliers due to their unique design or the length of time necessary for design work our longterm relationships with suppliers allow us to proactively manage technology road maps and product discontinuance plans and monitor their financial health even so some suppliers may still extend their lead times limit supplies increase prices or cease to produce necessary parts for our products if these are unique components we may not be able to find a substitute quickly or at all to address the potential disruption in our supply chain we use a number of techniques including qualifying multiple sources of supply and redesign of products for alternative components in addition while we generally attempt to keep our inventory at minimal levels we do purchase incremental inventory as circumstances warrant to protect the supply chain 

environmental 

our rd manufacturing and distribution operations involve the use of hazardous substances and are regulated under international federal state and local laws governing health and safety and the environment we apply strict standards for protection of the environment and occupational health and safety to sites inside and outside the united states even if not subject to regulation imposed by foreign governments we believe that our properties and operations at our facilities comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and occupational health and safety laws however the risk of environmental liabilities cannot be completely eliminated and there can be no assurance that the application of environmental and health and safety laws will not require us to incur significant expenditures we are also regulated under a number of international federal state and local laws regarding recycling product packaging and product content requirements the environmental product contentdisposal and recycling laws are gradually becoming more stringent and may cause us to incur significant expenditures in the future 

some of our properties are undergoing remediation by hewlettpackard company hp for subsurface contaminations that were known at the time of agilent’s separation from hp in 1999 in connection with agilent’s separation from hp hp and agilent entered into an agreement pursuant to which hp agreed to retain the liability for this subsurface contamination perform the required remediation and indemnify agilent with respect to claims arising out of that contamination agilent has assigned its rights and obligations under this agreement to keysight in respect of facilities transferred to keysight in the separation as a result hp has access to a limited number of our properties to perform remediation although hp agreed to minimize interference with onsite operations at such properties remediation activities and subsurface contamination may require us to incur unreimbursed costs and could harm onsite operations and the future use and value of the properties in connection with the separation agilent will indemnify us directly for any liabilities related thereto we cannot be sure that hp will continue to fulfill its remediation obligations or that agilent will continue to fulfill its indemnification obligations 

in connection with the separation agilent also agreed to indemnify us for any liability associated with contamination from past operations at all properties transferred from agilent to us we cannot be sure that agilent will fulfill its indemnification obligations 

we maintain a comprehensive environmental site liability insurance policy which may cover certain cleanup costs or legal claims related to environmental contamination this policy covers specified active inactive and divested locations 

  

international operations 

our net revenue originating outside the united states as a percentage of our total net revenue was approximately 65 percent in fiscal 2015 64 percent in fiscal 2014 and 67 percent in fiscal 2013 the majority of which was from customers other than foreign governments revenues from external customers are generally attributed to regions based upon the location of our sales representative 

longlived assets located outside of the united states as a percentage of our total longlived assets was approximately 62 percent in fiscal year 2015 and 64 percent in fiscal year 2014 approximately 22 and 26 percent of our longlived assets were located in japan in fiscal years 2015 and 2014 respectively approximately 12 and 14 percent of our longlived assets were located in malaysia in fiscal years 2015 and 2014 respectively 

most of our sales in international markets are made by foreign sales subsidiaries in countries with low sales volumes sales are made through various representatives and distributors however we also sell into international markets directly from the united states 

our international business is subject to risks customarily encountered in foreign operations including interruption to transportation flows for delivery of parts to us and finished goods to our customers changes in a specific countrys or regions political or economic conditions trade protection measures import or export licensing requirements consequences from changes in tax laws and regulatory requirements difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations differing labor regulations differing protection of intellectual property and geopolitical turmoil including terrorism and war we are also exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in our sales commitments anticipated sales and expenses and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the local functional currency and may also become subject to interest rate risk inherent in any debt we incur or investment portfolios we hold there may be an increased risk of political unrest in regions where we have significant manufacturing operations such as southeast asia however we believe that our international diversification provides stability to our worldwide operations and reduces the impact on us of adverse economic changes in any single country financial information about our international operations is contained in note 21 segment information to our combined and consolidated financial statements

 item 1a risk factors 

risks uncertainties and other factors that may affect future results 

risks related to our business 

depressed and uncertain general economic conditions may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

our business is sensitive to negative changes in general economic conditions both inside and outside the united states the continued economic downturn may adversely impact our business resulting in 

 our operating results and financial condition could be harmed if the markets into which we sell our products decline or do not grow as anticipated 

visibility into our markets is limited our quarterly sales and operating results are highly dependent on the volume and timing of technologyrelated spending and orders received during the fiscal quarter which are difficult to forecast and may be cancelled by our customers in addition our revenues and earnings forecasts for future fiscal quarters are often based on the expected seasonality or cyclicality of our markets however the markets we serve do not always experience the seasonality or cyclicality that we expect any decline in our customers markets would likely result in a reduction in demand for our products and services the broader semiconductor market is one of the drivers for our business and therefore a decrease in the semiconductor market could harm our business also if our customers markets decline we may not be able to collect on outstanding amounts due to us such declines could harm our financial position results of operations cash flows and stock price and could limit our profitability also in such an environment pricing pressures could intensify since a significant portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed in nature due to sales rd and manufacturing costs if we were unable to respond quickly enough these pricing pressures could further reduce our operating margins 

if we do not introduce successful new products and services in a timely manner to address increased competition rapid technological changes and changing industry standards our products and services will become obsolete and our operating results will suffer 

we generally sell our products in industries that are characterized by increased competition through frequent new product and service introductions rapid technological changes and changing industry standards in addition many of the markets in which we operate are seasonal and cyclical without the timely introduction of new products services and enhancements our products and services will become technologically obsolete over time in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer the success of new products and services will depend on several factors including our ability to 

 dependence on contract manufacturing and outsourcing other portions of our supply chain may adversely affect our ability to bring products to market and damage our reputation dependence on outsourced information technology and other administrative functions may impair our ability to operate effectively 

as part of our efforts to streamline operations and to cut costs we outsource aspects of our manufacturing processes and other functions and continue to evaluate additional outsourcing if our contract manufacturers or other outsourcers fail to perform their obligations in a timely manner or at satisfactory quality levels our ability to bring products to market and our reputation could suffer for example during a market upturn our contract manufacturers may be unable to meet our demand requirements which may preclude us from fulfilling our customers orders on a timely basis the ability of these manufacturers to perform is largely outside of our control additionally changing or replacing our contract manufacturers or other outsourcees could cause disruptions or delays in addition we outsource significant portions of our information technology it and other administrative 

  

functions since it is critical to our operations any failure of our it providers to perform could impair our ability to operate effectively in addition to the risks outlined above problems with manufacturing or it outsourcing could result in lower revenues and unrealized efficiencies and could impact our results of operations and stock price much of our outsourcing takes place in developing countries and as a result may be subject to geopolitical uncertainty 

failure to adjust our purchases due to changing market conditions or failure to estimate our customers demand could adversely affect our income 

our income could be harmed if we are unable to adjust our purchases to market fluctuations including those caused by the seasonal or cyclical nature of the markets in which we operate the sale of our products and services are dependent to a large degree on customers whose industries are subject to seasonal or cyclical trends in the demand for their products for example the consumer electronics market is particularly volatile making demand difficult to anticipate during a market upturn we may not be able to purchase sufficient supplies or components to meet increasing product demand which could materially affect our results in the past we have seen a shortage of parts for some of our products in addition some of the parts that require custom design are not readily available from alternate suppliers due to their unique design or the length of time necessary for design work should a supplier cease manufacturing such a component we would be forced to reengineer our product in addition to discontinuing parts suppliers may also extend lead times limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors in order to secure components for the production of products we may continue to enter into noncancellable purchase commitments with vendors or at times make advance payments to suppliers which could impact our ability to adjust our inventory to declining market demands prior commitments of this type have resulted in an excess of parts when demand for communications and electronics products has decreased if demand for our products is less than we expect we may experience additional excess and obsolete inventories and be forced to incur additional charges 

our operating results may suffer if our manufacturing capacity does not match the demand for our products 

because we cannot immediately adapt our production capacity and related cost structures to rapidly changing market conditions when demand does not meet our expectations our manufacturing capacity will likely exceed our production requirements if during a general market upturn or an upturn in our business we cannot increase our manufacturing capacity to meet product demand we will not be able to fulfill orders in a timely manner which could lead to order cancellations contract breaches or indemnification obligations this inability could materially and adversely limit our ability to improve our income margin and operating results by contrast if during an economic downturn we had excess manufacturing capacity then our fixed costs associated with excess manufacturing capacity would adversely affect our income margins and operating results 

economic political and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our results of operations 

because we sell our products worldwide our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally we anticipate that revenue from international operations will continue to represent a majority of our total revenue in addition many of our employees contract manufacturers suppliers job functions and manufacturing facilities are located outside the united states accordingly our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors including 

 we centralize most of our accounting processes at two locations india and malaysia these processes include general accounting inventory cost accounting accounts payable and accounts receivables functions if conditions change in those countries it may adversely affect operations including impairing our ability to pay our suppliers our results of operations as well as our liquidity may be adversely affected and possible delays may occur in reporting financial results 

additionally we must comply with complex foreign and us laws and regulations such as the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials and anticompetition regulations violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties criminal sanctions restrictions on our 

  

business conduct and on our ability to offer our products in one or more countries and could also materially affect our brand ability to attract and retain employees international operations business and operating results although we plan to implement policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations there can be no assurance that our employees contractors or agents will not violate these policies and procedures 

in addition although a substantial amount of our products are priced and paid for in us dollars many of our products are priced in local currencies and a significant amount of certain types of expenses such as payroll utilities tax and marketing expenses are paid in local currencies our hedging programs are designed to reduce but not entirely eliminate within any given 12month period the impact of currency exchange rate movements including those caused by currency controls which could impact our business operating results and financial condition by resulting in lower revenue or increased expenses however for expenses beyond a 12month period our hedging strategy will not mitigate our exchange rate risk in addition our currency hedging programs involve thirdparty financial institutions as counterparties the weakening or failure of these counterparties may adversely affect our hedging programs and our financial condition through among other things a reduction in the number of available counterparties increasingly unfavorable terms or the failure of counterparties to perform under hedging contracts 

significant key customers or large orders may expose us to additional business and legal risks that could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition  

certain significant key customers have substantial purchasing power and leverage in negotiating contractual arrangements with us these customers may demand contract terms that differ considerably from our standard terms and conditions large orders may also include severe contractual liabilities for us if we fail to provide the quantity and quality of product at the required delivery times while we attempt to contractually limit our potential liability under such contracts we may have to agree to some or all of these types of provisions to secure these orders and to continue to grow our business such actions expose us to significant additional risks which could result in a material adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition 

our business will suffer if we are not able to retain and hire key personnel 

our future success depends partly on the continued service of our key research engineering sales marketing manufacturing executive and administrative personnel if we fail to retain and hire a sufficient number of these personnel we may not be able to maintain or expand our business the markets in which we operate are dynamic and we may need to respond with reorganizations workforce reductions and site closures from time to time we believe our pay levels are competitive within the regions that we operate however there is also intense competition for certain highly technical specialties in geographic areas in which we operate and it may become more difficult to retain key employees 

environmental contamination from past operations could subject us to unreimbursed costs and could harm onsite operations and the future use and value of the properties involved and environmental contamination caused by ongoing operations could subject us to substantial liabilities in the future 

some of our properties are undergoing remediation by hewlettpackard company hp for subsurface contaminations that were known at the time of agilents separation from hp in 1999 in connection with agilents separation from hp hp and agilent entered into an agreement pursuant to which hp agreed to retain the liability for this subsurface contamination perform the required remediation and indemnify agilent with respect to claims arising out of that contamination agilent has assigned its rights and obligations under this agreement to keysight in respect of facilities transferred to us in the separation as a result hp will have access to a limited number of our properties to perform remediation although hp agreed to minimize interference with onsite operations at such properties remediation activities and subsurface contamination may require us to incur unreimbursed costs and could harm onsite operations and the future use and value of the properties in connection with the separation agilent will indemnify us directly for any liabilities related thereto we cannot be sure that hp will continue to fulfill its remediation obligations or that agilent will continue to fulfill its indemnification obligations 

in connection with the separation from agilent agilent also agreed to indemnify us for any liability associated with contamination from past operations at all properties transferred from agilent to keysight we cannot be sure that agilent will fulfill its indemnification obligations 

our current manufacturing processes involve the use of substances regulated under various international federal state and local laws governing the environment as a result we may become subject to liabilities for environmental contamination and these liabilities may be substantial although our policy is to apply strict standards for environmental protection at our sites inside and outside the united states even if the sites outside the united states are not subject to regulations imposed by foreign governments we may not be aware of all conditions that could subject us to liability 

  

we and our customers are subject to various governmental regulations compliance with which may cause us to incur significant expenses and if we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with certain regulations we may be forced to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution and we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties 

we and our customers are subject to various significant international federal state and local regulations including but not limited to health and safety packaging product content labor and importexport regulations these regulations are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time we may be required to incur significant expenses to comply with these regulations or to remedy violations of these regulations any failure by us to comply with applicable government regulations could also result in cessation of our operations or portions of our operations product recalls or impositions of fines and restrictions on our ability to carry on or expand our operations if demand for our products is adversely affected or our costs increase our business would suffer 

our products and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies like the international standards organization as well as regulation by other agencies such as the us federal communications commission we also must comply with work safety rules if we fail to adequately address any of these regulations our businesses could be harmed 

third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property rights and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products or services 

from time to time third parties may claim that one or more of our products or services infringe their intellectual property rights we analyze and take action in response to such claims on a casebycase basis any dispute or litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and timeconsuming due to the complexity of our technology and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation and could divert our management and key personnel from business operations a claim of intellectual property infringement could cause us to enter into a costly or restrictive license agreement which may not be available under acceptable terms or at all require us to redesign certain of our products which would be costly and timeconsuming andor subject us to significant damages or an injunction against the development and sale of certain products or services in certain of our businesses we rely on thirdparty intellectual property licenses and we cannot ensure that these licenses will be available to us in the future on terms favorable to us or at all 

third parties may infringe our intellectual property rights and we may suffer competitive injury or expend significant resources enforcing our intellectual property rights 

our success depends in part on our proprietary technology including technology we obtained through acquisitions we rely on various intellectual property rights including patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets as well as confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish our proprietary rights if we do not enforce our intellectual property rights successfully our competitive position may suffer which could harm our operating results 

our pending patent copyright and trademark registration applications may not be allowed or competitors may challenge the validity or scope of our patents copyrights or trademarks in addition our patents copyrights trademarks and other intellectual property rights may not provide us with a significant competitive advantage in preparation for the separation and distribution we have applied for trademarks related to our new global brand name in various jurisdictions worldwide any successful opposition to our applications in material jurisdictions could impose material costs on us or make it more difficult to protect our brand different jurisdictions vary widely in the level of protection and priority they give to trademark and other intellectual property rights 

we may be required to spend significant resources monitoring our intellectual property rights and we may or may not be able to detect infringement of such rights by third parties our competitive position may be harmed if we cannot detect infringement and enforce our intellectual property rights in a timely manner or at all in some circumstances we may choose to not pursue enforcement due to a variety of reasons in addition competitors may avoid infringement by designing around our intellectual property rights or by developing noninfringing competing technologies intellectual property rights and our ability to enforce them may be unavailable or limited in some countries which could make it easier for competitors to capture market share and could result in lost revenues to the company furthermore some of our intellectual property is licensed to others which allows them to compete with us using that intellectual property 

we are or will be subject to ongoing tax examinations of our tax returns by the irs and other tax authorities an adverse outcome of any such audit or examination by the irs or other tax authority could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

we are or will be subject to ongoing tax examinations of our tax returns by the irs and other tax authorities in various jurisdictions we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from ongoing tax examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes these assessments can require considerable estimates and judgments intercompany transactions associated with the sale of inventory services intellectual property and cost sharing arrangements are complex and affect our tax liabilities the calculation of our tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and 

  

regulations in multiple jurisdictions the outcomes of any tax examinations could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition due to the complexity of tax contingencies the ultimate resolution of any tax matters related to operations postseparation may result in payments greater or less than amounts accrued 

our operations may be adversely impacted by changes in our business mix or changes in the tax legislative landscape 

our effective tax rate may be adversely impacted by among other things changes in the mix of our earnings among countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets and changes in tax laws we cannot give any assurance as to what our effective tax rate will be in the future because among other things there is uncertainty regarding the tax policies of the jurisdictions where we operate changes in tax laws such as tax reform in the united states or changes in tax laws resulting from the organization for economic cooperation and development’s “oecd” multijurisdictional plan of action to address “base erosion and profit shifting” could impact our effective tax rate 

if tax incentives change or cease to be in effect our income taxes could increase significantly 

we benefit from tax incentives extended to our foreign subsidiaries to encourage investment or employment several jurisdictions have granted or are anticipated to grant us tax incentives that require renewal at various times in the future the most significant being singapore we do not expect incentives granted by other jurisdictions to have a material impact on our financial statements the singapore tax incentive requires that specific conditions be satisfied which include achieving thresholds of employment ownership of certain assets as well as specific types of investment activities within singapore we believe that we will satisfy such conditions in the future 

our taxes could increase if the incentives are not renewed upon expiration if we cannot or do not wish to satisfy all or portions of the tax incentive conditions we may lose the related tax incentive and could be required to refund the benefits that the tax incentives previously provided as a result our effective tax rate could be higher than it would have been had we maintained the benefits of the tax incentives 

if we suffer a loss to our factories facilities or distribution system due to a catastrophic event our operations could be significantly harmed 

our factories facilities and distribution system are subject to catastrophic loss due to fire flood terrorism or other natural or manmade disasters in particular several of our facilities could be subject to a catastrophic loss caused by earthquake or other natural disasters due to their locations for example our production facilities headquarters and laboratories in california and our production facilities in japan are all located in areas with aboveaverage seismic activity if any of these facilities were to experience a catastrophic loss it could disrupt our operations delay production shipments and revenue and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility if such a disruption were to occur we could breach our agreements our reputation could be harmed and our business and operating results could be adversely affected in addition since we have consolidated our manufacturing facilities we are more likely to experience an interruption to our operations in the event of a catastrophe in any one location although we carry insurance for property damage and business interruption we do not carry insurance or financial reserves for interruptions or potential losses arising from earthquakes or terrorism also our thirdparty insurance coverage will vary from time to time in both type and amount depending on availability cost and our decision with respect to risk retention economic conditions and uncertainties in global markets may adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain thirdparty insurance if our thirdparty insurance coverage is adversely affected or to the extent we have elected to selfinsure we may be at a greater risk that our operations will be harmed by a catastrophic loss 

if we experience a significant disruption in or breach in security of our information technology systems our business could be adversely affected 

we rely on several centralized information technology systems to provide products and services maintain financial records process orders manage inventory process shipments to customers and operate other critical functions if we experience a prolonged system disruption in the information technology systems that involve our interactions with customers or suppliers it could result in the loss of sales and customers and significant incremental costs which could adversely affect our business in addition our information technology systems may be susceptible to damage disruptions or shutdowns due to power outages hardware failures computer viruses attacks by computer hackers telecommunication failures user errors catastrophes or other unforeseen events furthermore security breaches of our information technology systems could result in the misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to the company or our employees partners customers or suppliers which could result in significant financial or reputational damage to the company 

our business and financial results may be adversely affected by various legal and regulatory proceedings 

we are subject to legal proceedings lawsuits and other claims in the normal course of business and could become subject to additional claims in the future some of which could be material the outcome of existing proceedings lawsuits and claims may 

  

differ from our expectations because the outcomes of litigation are often difficult to reliably predict various factors or developments can lead us to change current estimates of liabilities and related insurance receivables where applicable or permit us to make such estimates for matters previously not susceptible to reasonable estimates such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment a significant settlement significant regulatory developments or changes in applicable law a future adverse ruling settlement or unfavorable development could result in charges that could adversely affect our business operating results or financial condition 

our acquisitions strategic alliances joint ventures and divestitures may result in financial results that are different than expected 

in the normal course of business we may engage in discussions with third parties relating to possible acquisitions strategic alliances joint ventures and divestitures as a result of such transactions our financial results may differ from our own or the investment communitys expectations in a given fiscal quarter or over the long term if market conditions or other factors lead us to change our strategic direction we may not realize the expected value from such transactions further such transactions often have postclosing arrangements including but not limited to postclosing adjustments transition services escrows or indemnifications the financial results of which can be difficult to predict in addition acquisitions and strategic alliances may require us to integrate a different company culture management team and business infrastructure we may have difficulty developing manufacturing and marketing the products of a newly acquired company in a way that enhances the performance of our businesses or product lines to realize the value from expected synergies depending on the size and complexity of an acquisition the successful integration of the entity depends on a variety of factors including 

 if we do not realize the expected benefits or synergies of such transactions our combined and consolidated financial position results of operations cash flows and stock price could be negatively impacted   

in addition effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable and accurate financial reports and to effectively prevent fraud we are devoting significant resources and time to comply with the internal control over financial reporting requirements of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 however we cannot be certain that these measures will ensure that we design implement and maintain adequate control over our financial processes and reporting in the future especially in the context of acquisitions of other businesses any difficulties in the assimilation of acquired businesses into our control system could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations inferior internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our stock and our access to capital all of these efforts require varying levels of management resources which may divert our attention from other business operations 

we have substantial cash requirements in the united states although most of our cash is generated outside of the united states the failure to maintain a level of cash sufficient to address our cash requirements in the united states could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

although the cash generated in the united states from our operations including any cash and nonpermanently invested earnings repatriated to the united states is expected to cover our normal operating requirements and debt service requirements a substantial amount of additional cash may be required for special purposes such as the maturity of our current and future debt obligations any dividends that may be declared any future stock repurchase programs and any acquisitions if we encounter a significant need for liquidity domestically that we cannot fulfill through borrowings equity offerings or other internal or external sources the transfer of cash into the united states may incur an overall tax rate higher than our tax rates have been in the past and negatively impact aftertax earnings 

we have outstanding debt and may incur other debt in the future which could adversely affect our financial condition liquidity and results of operations 

we currently have outstanding debt as well as availability to borrow under a revolving credit facility we may borrow additional amounts in the future and use the proceeds from any future borrowing for general corporate purposes future acquisitions expansion of our business or repurchases of our outstanding shares of common stock 

our incurrence of this debt and increases in our aggregate levels of debt may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition by among other things 

 18 

  

our current revolving credit facility imposes restrictions on us including restrictions on our ability to create liens on our assets and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur indebtedness and requires us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios our ability to comply with these ratios may be affected by events beyond our control in addition the indenture governing our senior notes contains covenants that may adversely affect our ability to incur certain liens or engage in certain types of sale and leaseback transactions if we breach any of the covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders then subject to applicable cure periods our outstanding indebtedness could be declared immediately due and payable 

we may need additional financing in the future to meet our capital needs or to make opportunistic acquisitions and such financing may not be available on terms favorable to us if at all and may be dilutive to existing shareholders 

we may need to seek additional financing for our general corporate purposes for example we may need to increase our investment in rd activities or need funds to make acquisitions we may be unable to obtain any desired additional financing on terms favorable to us if at all if adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms we may be unable to fund our expansion successfully develop or enhance products or respond to competitive pressures any of which could negatively affect our business if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity securities our shareholders will experience dilution of their ownership interest if we raise additional funds by issuing debt we may be subject to further limitations on our operations and ability to pay dividends due to restrictive covenants 

adverse conditions in the global banking industry and credit markets may adversely impact the value of our cash investments or impair our liquidity 

our cash and cash equivalents are invested or held in a mix of money market funds time deposit accounts and bank demand deposit accounts disruptions in the financial markets may in some cases result in an inability to access assets such as money market funds that traditionally have been viewed as highly liquid any failure of our counterparty financial institutions or funds in which we have invested may adversely impact our cash and cash equivalent positions and in turn our results and financial condition 

future investment returns on pension assets may be lower than expected or interest rates may decline requiring us to make significant additional cash contributions to our future plans 

we sponsor several defined benefit pension plans that cover many of our salaried and hourly employees the federal pension protection act of 2006 requires that certain capitalization levels be maintained in each of the us plans and there may be similar funding requirements in the plans outside the united states because it is unknown what the investment return on pension assets will be in future years or what interest rates may be at any point in time no assurances can be given that applicable law will not require us to make future material plan contributions any such contributions could adversely affect our financial condition 

risks related to the separation 

our historical financial information is not necessarily representative of the results that we would have achieved as a separate publiclytraded company and may not be a reliable indicator of our future results 

the historical information about the company prior to fiscal year 2015 refers to our business as operated by and integrated with agilent our historical financial information prior to fiscal year 2015 included in this form 10k is derived from the consolidated financial statements and accounting records of agilent accordingly the historical financial information does not necessarily reflect the financial condition results of operations or cash flows that we would have achieved as a separate publiclytraded company during the periods presented or those that we will achieve in the future primarily as a result of the factors described below 

 other significant changes may occur in our cost structure management financing and business operations as a result of operating as a company separate from agilent for additional information about the past financial performance of our business

potential indemnification liabilities to agilent pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the separation and distribution agreement provides for among other things indemnification obligations designed to make us financially responsible for any liabilities associated with assets used by our business our failure to pay perform or otherwise promptly discharge any such liabilities or contracts in accordance with their respective terms whether prior to at or after the distribution any guarantee indemnification obligation surety bond or other credit support agreement arrangement commitment or understanding by agilent for our benefit unless they are liabilities related to assets used in the agilent business any breach by us of the separation agreement or any of the ancillary agreements or any action by us in contravention of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws and any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading with respect to all information contained in the registration statement or any other disclosure document that describes the separation or the distribution or the company and its subsidiaries or primarily relates to the transactions contemplated by the separation and distribution agreement subject to certain exceptions if we are required to indemnify agilent under the circumstances set forth in the separation and distribution agreement we may be subject to substantial liabilities 

in connection with our separation from agilent agilent will indemnify us for certain liabilities however there can be no assurance that the indemnity will be sufficient to insure us against the full amount of such liabilities or that agilents ability to satisfy its indemnification obligation will not be impaired in the future 

pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement and certain other agreements with agilent agilent agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities however third parties could also seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that agilent has agreed to retain and there can be no assurance that the indemnity from agilent will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities or that agilent will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations in addition agilents insurers may attempt to deny us coverage for liabilities associated with certain occurrences of indemnified liabilities prior to the separation moreover even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from agilent or such insurance providers any amounts for which we are held liable we may be temporarily required to bear these losses each of these risks could negatively affect our business financial position results of operations and cash flows 

we will be subject to continuing contingent liabilities of agilent following the separation 

after the separation there are several significant areas where the liabilities of agilent may become our obligations for example under the internal revenue code and the related rules and regulations each corporation that was a member of the agilent us consolidated group during a taxable period or portion of a taxable period ending on or before the effective time of the distribution is severally liable for the us federal income tax liability of the entire agilent us consolidated group for that taxable period consequently if agilent is unable to pay the consolidated us federal income tax liability for a prior period we could be required to pay the entire amount of such tax which could be substantial and in excess of the amount allocated to it under the tax matters agreement between us and agilent other provisions of federal law establish similar liability for other matters including laws governing taxqualified pension plans as well as other contingent liabilities 

there could be significant liability if the distribution is determined to be a taxable transaction 

a condition to the distribution is that agilent received an opinion of baker  mckenzie llp tax counsel to agilent regarding the qualification of the separation and the distribution as a reorganization within the meaning of sections 355a and 368a1d of the code the opinion relies on certain facts assumptions representations and undertakings from agilent and keysight including those regarding the past and future conduct of the companies respective businesses and other matters if any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings are incorrect or not satisfied agilent and its shareholders may not be able to rely on the opinion and could be subject to significant tax liabilities notwithstanding the opinion of tax counsel the irs could determine on audit that the distribution is taxable if it determines that any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion 

if the distribution were determined to be taxable for us federal income tax purposes agilent and its shareholders that are subject to us federal income tax could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities for example if the distribution failed to qualify for taxfree treatment agilent would for us federal income tax purposes be treated as if it had sold the keysight common stock in a taxable sale for its fair market value and agilents shareholders who are subject to us federal income tax would be treated as receiving a taxable distribution in an amount equal to the fair market value of the keysight common stock received in the distribution in addition if the separation and distribution failed to qualify for taxfree treatment under federal 

  

state and local tax law andor foreign tax law agilent and under the tax matters agreement described below keysight could incur significant tax liabilities under us federal state local andor foreign tax law 

under the tax matters agreement between agilent and keysight we are generally required to indemnify agilent against taxes incurred by agilent that arise as a result of our taking or failing to take as the case may be certain actions that result in the distribution failing to meet the requirements of a taxfree distribution under section 355 of the code under the tax matters agreement between agilent and keysight we may also be required to indemnify agilent for other contingent tax liabilities which could materially adversely affect our financial position 

we may not be able to engage in certain corporate transactions for a twoyear period after the separation 

to preserve the taxfree treatment for us federal income tax purposes to agilent of the separation and distribution under the tax matters agreement that we have entered into with agilent we are restricted from taking any action that prevents the separation and distribution from being taxfree for us federal income tax purposes under the tax matters agreement for the twoyear period following the distribution we are prohibited except in certain circumstances from entering into acquisition merger liquidation sale and stock redemption transactions with respect to our stock if such transactions taken as a whole would result in one or more persons acquiring forty percent 40 or more of the outstanding keysight stock 

these restrictions may limit our ability to pursue certain strategic transactions or other transactions that we may believe to be in the best interests of our shareholders or that might increase the value of our business in addition under the tax matters agreement we may be required to indemnify agilent against any such tax liabilities as a result of the acquisition of keysights stock or assets even if we did not participate in or otherwise facilitate the acquisition 

certain of our executive officers and directors may have actual or potential conflicts of interest because of their equity interest in agilent 

the ownership by our executive officers and some of our directors of common shares of agilent may create or may create the appearance of conflicts of interest because of their current or former positions with agilent certain of our executive officers and directors own agilent common shares the individual holdings of common shares may be significant for some of these persons compared to these persons total assets even though our board of directors consist of a majority of directors who are independent and our executive officers ceased to be employees of agilent upon the separation continuing ownership of agilent common shares by our executive officers and some of our directors could create or appear to create potential conflicts of interest if keysight and agilent pursue the same corporate opportunities or face decisions that could have different implications for keysight and agilent 

the onetime and ongoing costs of the spinoff may be greater than we expected 

we have and will continue to incur costs in connection with our transition to being a standalone public company that relate primarily to accounting tax legal and other professional costs financing costs in connection with obtaining our financing as a standalone company compensation such as modifications to certain incentive awards as a result of spinoff recruiting and relocation costs associated with hiring our senior management personnel and costs to separate assets and information systems these costs whether incurred before or after the spinoff may be greater than anticipated and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

risks related to our common stock 

our share price may fluctuate significantly 

our common stock is listed on nyse under the ticker symbol “keys” the market price of our common stock may fluctuate widely depending on many factors some of which may be beyond our control including 

 21 

  

 stock markets in general have experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company these broad market fluctuations could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 

in addition when the market price of a company’s shares drops significantly shareholders often institute securities class action lawsuits against the company a lawsuit against us could cause us to incur substantial costs and could divert the time and attention of management and other resources 

we cannot guarantee the payment of dividends on our common stock or the timing or amount of any such dividends 

we do not currently expect to pay dividends on our common stock the payment of any dividends in the future and the timing and amount thereof to our shareholders will fall within the discretion of our board of directors the boards decisions regarding the payment of dividends will depend on many factors such as our financial condition earnings capital requirements debt service obligations restrictive covenants in our debt industry practice legal requirements regulatory constraints and other factors that the board deems relevant we cannot guarantee that we will pay a dividend in the future or continue to pay any dividends if we commence paying dividends 

certain provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and of delaware law may prevent or delay an acquisition of the company which could decrease the trading price of our common stock 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain and delaware law contains provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by making such practices or bids unacceptably expensive to the bidder and to encourage prospective acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover these provisions include among others 

 in addition because we have not chosen to be exempt from section 203 of the delaware general corporation law the dgcl this provision could also delay or prevent a change of control that some shareholders may favor section 203 provides that subject to limited exceptions persons that acquire or are affiliated with a person that acquires more than 15 of the outstanding voting stock of a delaware corporation an interested stockholder shall not engage in any business combination with that corporation including by merger consolidation or acquisitions of additional shares for a threeyear period following the date on which the person became an interested stockholder unless i prior to such time the board of directors of such corporation approved either the business combination or the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder ii upon consummation of the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder the interested stockholder owned at least 85 of the voting stock of such corporation at the time the transaction commenced excluding for purposes of 

  

determining the voting stock outstanding but not the outstanding voting stock owned by the interested stockholder the voting stock owned by directors who are also officers or held in employee benefit plans in which the employees do not have a confidential right to tender or vote stock held by the plan or iii on or subsequent to such time the business combination is approved by the board of directors of such corporation and authorized at a meeting of shareholders by the affirmative vote of at least twothirds of the outstanding voting stock of such corporation not owned by the interested stockholder 

we believe these provisions will protect our shareholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors and by providing our board of directors with more time to assess any acquisition proposal these provisions are not intended to make us immune from takeovers however these provisions will apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some shareholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that our board of directors determines is not in the best interests of the company and our shareholders these provisions may also prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors 

in addition an acquisition or further issuance of our stock could trigger the application of section 355e of the code under the tax matters agreement we would be required to indemnify agilent for the resulting tax and this indemnity obligation might discourage delay or prevent a change of control that some shareholders may consider favorable 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates that the state courts in the state of delaware or if no state court located within the state of delaware has jurisdiction the federal court for the district of delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our shareholders which could discourage lawsuits against the company and our directors and officers 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provide that unless the board of directors otherwise determines the state courts in the state of delaware or if no state court located within the state of delaware has jurisdiction the federal court for the district of delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors or officers to the company or our shareholders any action asserting a claim against us or any of our directors or officers arising pursuant to any provision of the dgcl or keysights amended and restated certificate of incorporation or bylaws or any action asserting a claim against us or any of our directors or officers governed by the internal affairs doctrine this exclusive forum provision may limit the ability of our shareholders to bring a claim in a judicial forum that such shareholders find favorable for disputes with us or our directors or officers which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors and officers

basis of presentation and separation from agilent 

keysight technologies inc we us keysight or the company incorporated in delaware on december 6 2013 is a measurement company providing core electronic design and test solutions to communications and electronics industries our fiscal year end is october 31 unless otherwise stated all years and dates refer to our fiscal year 

  

on november 1 2014 keysight technologies inc “we” our “keysight” or the company” became an independent publiclytraded company through the distribution by agilent technologies inc agilent of 100 percent of the outstanding common stock of keysight to agilents shareholders the separation each agilent shareholder of record as of the close of business on october 22 2014 received one share of keysight common stock for every two shares of agilent common stock held on the record date keysight was incorporated in delaware on december 6 2013 and is comprised of agilents former electronic measurement business keysights registration statement on form 10 was declared effective by the us securities and exchange commission on october 6 2014 keysights common stock began trading regularway under the ticker symbol keys on the new york stock exchange on november 3 2014 

agilent transferred substantially all of the assets and liabilities and operations of the electronic measurement business to keysight in august 2014 the capitalization combined f inancial statements prior to the capitalization were prepared on a standalone basis derived from agilent’s consolidated financial statements and accounting records including expenses that were allocated to us using estimates that we consider to be a reasonable reflection of the utilization of services provided to or benefits received by us 

following the capitalization the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company and our subsidiaries for the first half of fiscal year 2015 agilent provided some services on a transitional basis for a fee which were partially offset by other operating income from keysight services provided to agilent these services were received or provided under a transition services agreement the net costs associated with the transition services agreement were not materially different than the historical costs that were allocated to us related to these same services 

we are incurring other incremental costs as an independent publicly traded company as compared to the costs historically allocated to us by agilent these incremental costs are estimated to be approximately 15 million on an annual pretax basis in addition for the years ended october 31 2015 and 2014 we recognized nonrecurring separation and related costs of 20 million and 78 million respectively we expect to recognize additional nonrecurring separation and related costs which are currently estimated to range from 12 million to 17 million through fiscal 2016 these costs are expected to include primarily costs related to infrastructure resizing and optimization

years ended october 31 2015 2014 and 2013 

total orders in 2015 were 2853 million a decrease of 4 percent when compared to 2014 order declines in aerospace and defense and communications markets were partially offset by a slight increase in industrial computer and semiconductor market foreign currency movements had an unfavorable impact of 4 percentage points on the year‑over‑year comparison orders associated with acquisitions accounted for 1 percentage point of order growth for the year ended october 31 2015 when compared to 2014 orders of 2963 million in 2014 increased 3 percent when compared to 2013 with growth in all markets 

net revenue of 2856 million in 2015 decreased 3 percent when compared to 2014 with communications market contributing 2 percentage points of the decrease and industrial computer and semiconductor market contributing 1 percentage point of the decrease while aerospace and defense market revenue was flat foreign currency movements had an unfavorable impact of 4 percentage points on the year over year comparison the revenue increase associated with acquisitions accounted for approximately 1 percentage point for the year ended october 31 2015 when compared to 2014 net revenue of 2933 million in 2014 increased 2 percent when compared to 2013 with industrial computer and semiconductor market contributing 2 percentage points of the increase and communications market contributing 1 percentage point of the increase partially offset by a decline in aerospace and defense market revenue foreign currency movements had an unfavorable impact of 1 percentage point on the year over year comparison 

  

net income was 513 million in 2015 compared to net income of 392 million in 2014 and 457 million in 2013 in 2015 2014 and 2013 we generated operating cash flows of 376 million 563 million and 566 million respectively 

looking forward we believe the longterm growth rate of our markets is 2 to 3 percent although current macroeconomic indicators remain mixed we intend to leverage our unique formula of hardware plus software plus people to create value for our customers and shareholders our focus is on delivering value through innovative electronic design and test solutions as well as improving our operational efficiency as an independent company 

we accelerated our efforts in both wireless communications and software by acquiring anite in august 2015 this acquisition expands our solutions offering in wireless communications design and test specifically into the software layer for design and validation and provides an adjacent market opportunity in network test 

restructuring activities 

we initiated a targeted workforce reduction program in july 2015 that is expected to reduce keysights total headcount by approximately 104 employees representing approximately 1 percent of our global workforce the timing and scope of workforce reductions will vary based on local legal requirements this is a targeted workforce management program designed to restructure our operations and cost structure for optimization of resources and cost savings in the current year we recognized 8 million of expense associated with the headcount reduction under this workforce reduction program as of october 31 2015 approximately 70 employees have left and 5 million was paid in severance under the above actions 

we also announced a preretirement notification program for retirementeligible employees to provide early notice of their planned retirement in return for severance benefits the program is entirely voluntary and can be initiated only by an employee approximately 160 employees of our total workforce opted for early retirement under this program as of october 31 2015 in the current year we recognized 8 million of expense associated with the headcount reductions and paid 6 million in severance under the preretirement notification program 

when completed these programs are expected to result in operational efficiency and net annual savings of approximately 18 million while maintaining our focus on growing the business as of october 31 2015 we have a remaining accrual of 6 million under these plans we expect to complete a majority of these actions by the end of first quarter of fiscal year 2016

currency exchange rate exposure 

our revenues costs and expenses and monetary assets and liabilities are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our global operating and financing activities we hedge revenues expenses and balance sheet exposures that are not denominated in the functional currencies of our subsidiaries on a shortterm and anticipated basis the result of the hedging has been included in our combined and consolidated statement of operations we experience some fluctuations within individual lines of the consolidated balance sheet and combined and consolidated statement of operations because our hedging program is not designed to offset the currency movements in each category of revenues expenses monetary assets and liabilities our hedging program is designed to hedge currency movements on a relatively shortterm basis of up to a rolling twelve month period therefore we are exposed to currency fluctuations over the longer term to the extent that we are required to pay for all or portions of an acquisition price in foreign currencies we may enter into foreign exchange contracts to reduce the risk that currency movements will impact the us dollar cost of the transaction

backlog 

backlog represents the amount of revenue expected from orders that have already been booked including orders for goods and services that have not been delivered to customers orders invoiced but not yet recognized as revenue and orders for goods that were shipped but not invoiced awaiting acceptance by customers 

at october 31 2015 our unfilled backlog was approximately 779 million as compared to approximately 781 million at october 31 2014 for the measurement solutions business our backlog was approximately 653 million at october 31 2015 as compared to approximately 627 million at october 31 2014 within our customer services and support business our backlog was approximately 126 million at october 31 2015 as compared to approximately 154 million at october 31 2014 the reduction in the customer services and support business backlog in fiscal 2015 was primarily due to a change in our standard warranty term which increased from one to three years for most of our products in the second quarter of fiscal 2013 revenue associated with extended warranties which provide coverage beyond the standard warranty term is deferred and amortized over the extended period of coverage as a result of the extension of the standard warranty term backlog associated with extended warranties has declined threeyear warranty is now included as part of the total solution and the value is captured as part of the initial sales price 

we expect that a majority of the backlog will be recognized as revenue within six months on average our backlog represents approximately three months of revenue we believe backlog on any particular date while indicative of shortterm revenue performance is not necessarily a reliable indicator of medium or longterm revenue performance 

costs and expenses 





gross margin remained flat in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to lower depreciation warranty and inventory charges offset by lower volume gross margin declined 1 percentage point in 2014 compared to 2013 on slightly higher revenue higher inventory charges and pricing pressure in the wireless manufacturing market were the primary reasons for the lower gross margin 

excess and obsolete inventory charges were 28 million in 2015 33 million in 2014 and 21 million in 2013 sales of previously writtendown inventory were 2 million in 2015 and 1 million in 2014 and 2013 

research and development expense increased 7 percent in 2015 compared to 2014 the increased expenditure was due to our continued investment in research and development programs and increased costs due to the acquisitions partially offset by the favorable impact of currency movements as a percentage of total revenue research and development expenses increased 2 percentage points to 14 percent in 2015 from 12 percent in 2014 we expect investment in research and development to continue at current levels and have focused our development efforts on strategic growth opportunities research and development expenses declined 4 percent in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to lower infrastructurerelated expenses reductions in development spending variable and incentive pay and infrastructurerelated expenses and the favorable impact of currency movements were partially offset by investments in acquisitions and wage increases 

selling general and administrative expenses were flat in 2015 when compared to 2014 primarily driven by lower separation costs and favorable impact of currency movements offset by increases in sharebased compensation restructuring programs and increased costs due to acquisitions primarily anite selling general and administrative expenses increased 5 percent in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to higher costs related to nonrecurring preseparation transaction costs and an increase in marketing expenses partially offset by reductions in infrastructure costs and the favorable impact of currency movements 

  

other operating expense income net for 2015 was 18 million which includes primarily rental income 

operating margins declined 1 percentage point in 2015 compared to 2014 on lower revenue volume and increases in research and development expenses restructuring programs acquisition and integration related expenses offset by decline in separation costs and the favorable impact of foreign currency operating margins declined 1 percentage point in 2014 compared to 2013 driven primarily by onetime separation costs 

as of october 31 2015 our headcount was approximately 10250 compared to 9600 in 2014 primarily as a result of the acquisition of anite 

interest expense 

interest expense for the year ended october 31 2015 and 2014 was 46 million and 3 million respectively and relates to interest on our senior notes issued in october 2014 

income taxes 



for 2015 the effective tax rate was a benefit of 32 percent which is lower than the us statutory rate primarily due to the retroactive benefit of two tax incentives in singapore approved during 2015 also the tax rate was lower than the us statutory rate due to the mix of earnings in the nonus jurisdictions taxed at lower statutory tax rates 

for 2014 the effective tax rate was 18 percent the 18 percent effective tax is lower than the us statutory rate primarily due to the mix of earnings in nonus jurisdictions taxed at lower statutory tax rates in particular singapore where we benefited from tax incentives for the first three quarters of 2014 which resulted in 40 million lower income tax expense the 2014 rate was also favorably impacted by a 55 million benefit from a prior year reserve release which was offset by 62 million of tax expense as a result of the repatriation of foreign earnings 

for 2013 the effective tax rate was 9 percent the 9 percent effective tax is lower than the us statutory rate primarily due to the mix of earnings in nonus jurisdictions taxed at lower statutory tax rates in particular singapore where we benefited from tax incentives 

we benefit from tax incentives in several different jurisdictions most significantly in singapore and several jurisdictions have granted or are anticipated to grant us tax incentives that require renewal at various times in the future the tax incentives provide lower rates of taxation on certain classes of income and require various thresholds of investments and employment or specific types of income in those jurisdictions the tax incentives are due for renewal between 2016 and 2023 the impact of the tax incentives decreased income taxes by 250 million 40 million and 68 million in 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively 

in accordance with the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes for all us and other tax jurisdictions we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes and interest will be due if our estimate of income tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment a further charge to expense would be required if events occur and the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary we include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes in the combined and consolidated statements of operations 

for the majority of our entities the open tax years for the irs state and most foreign audit authorities are from august 1 2014 through the current tax year for certain historical agilent foreign entities that keysight retained as part of the separation the tax years generally remain open back to the year 2005 for certain entities acquired during 2015 the tax years also remain open back to the year 2005 given the number of years and numerous matters that remain subject to examination in various tax jurisdictions we are unable to estimate the range of possible changes to the balance of our unrecognized tax benefits 

  

for fiscal 2014 and prior we have calculated our taxes on a separate return basis however the amounts recorded for fiscal 2014 and prior are not necessarily representative of the amounts that would have been reflected in the financial statements had we been an entity that operated independently of agilent consequently our results after our separation from agilent may be materially different from our historical results 

segment overview 

we have two reportable operating segments measurement solutions and customer support and services the measurement solutions segment is primarily the hardware and associated software businesses serving the electronic measurement market the customer support and services segment provides hardware repair and calibration and the resale of used instrument equipment 

the profitability of each of the segments is measured after excluding restructuring and asset impairment charges investment gains and losses interest income interest expense acquisition and integration costs separation and related costs acquisitionrelated fair value adjustments and noncash amortization in 2015 we began excluding sharebased compensation expense in addition to the items noted above to derive segment profitability prior year numbers have been revised to reflect the change 

measurement solutions business 

our measurement solutions business provides electronic measurement instruments and systems with related software and software design tools that are used in the design development manufacture installation deployment and operation of electronics equipment we provide startup assistance consulting optimization and application support throughout our customer’s product lifecycle our electronic design and test solutions serve the following markets communications aerospace and defense and industrial computer and semiconductor 

net revenue 



measurement solutions net revenue in 2015 decreased 3 percent compared to 2014 and was flat excluding the impact of currency fluctuations the decline is driven primarily by lower revenue from the communications market which contributed 2 percentage points to the decline and the industrial computer and semiconductor market which contributed 1 percentage point to the decline while aerospace and defense market revenue was flat revenue from the anite acquisition added approximately 1 percentage point to the revenue increase for the year ended october 31 2015 measurement solutions net revenue in 2014 increased 2 percent compared to 2013 with modest growth in the industrial computer and semiconductor market contributing 2 percentage points to the increase and the communications market contributing 1 percentage point to the increase partially offset by a decline in aerospace and defense market revenue 

gross margin and operating margin 

the following table shows the measurement solutions business margins expenses and income from operations for 2015  versus 2014  and 2014  versus 2013  





  

gross margin in 2015 increased 2 percentage points when compared to 2014 primarily due to lower depreciation warranty and inventory charges gross margin in 2014 decreased 1 percentage point when compared to 2013 primarily due to higher inventory charges and pricing pressure in the wireless manufacturing market 

research and development expenses increased 7 percent in 2015 compared to 2014 increased expenditures were due to our continued investment in research and development programs and increased costs due to the anite acquisition partially offset by the favorable impact of currency movements research and development expenses decreased 2 percent in 2014 compared to 2013 driven primarily by lower infrastructure costs we expect investment in research and development to continue at current levels and have focused our development efforts on strategic growth opportunities 

selling general and administrative expenses increased 1 percent in 2015 compared to 2014 driven primarily by the increased costs related to the anite acquisition higher infrastructurerelated costs and advertising and marketing expenses which are partially offset by lower peoplerelated costs and favorable currency movements selling general and administrative expenses decreased 2 percent in 2014 compared to 2013 decreases in infrastructure costs were partially offset by increases in marketing and discretionary spending 

operating margin remained flat in 2015 compared to 2014 as higher gross margin was offset by increases in operating expenses primarily due to increased costs related to the anite acquisition and investments in rd programs operating margin increased by 1 percentage point in 2014 compared to 2013 on higher revenue and lower operating expenses 

income from operations 

income from operations in 2015 decreased by 21 million or 4 percent on revenue decline of 72 million income from operations in 2014 increased by 24 million or 5 percent on a revenue increase of 40 million 

customer support and services business 

our customer support and services business provides hardware repair and calibration services and facilitates the resale of used equipment our customer support and services business enables our customers to maximize the value from their electronic measurement equipment and strengthens customer loyalty providing these services assures a high level of instrument performance and availability while minimizing the cost of ownership and downtime 

net revenue 



customer support and services net revenue in 2015 remained flat compared to 2014 growth in calibration services and remarketing sales of used equipment was offset by declines in the equipment repair business due to a reduction in extended warranty revenue as a result of extension of the standard warranty term from one to three years as discussed previously under backlog customer support and services net revenue in 2014 increased 1 percent compared to 2013 growth in calibration services and remarketing sales of used equipment was partially offset by declines in the equipment repair business due to a reduction in extended warranty revenue as a result of extension of the standard warranty term from one to three years 

  

gross margin and operating margin 

the following table shows the customer support and services business margins expenses and income from operations for 2015  versus 2014  and 2014  versus 2013  





gross margins in 2015 decreased 3 percentage points compared to 2014 primarily due to an increase in people related costs higher infrastructurerelated costs and an unfavorable service mix gross margins in 2014 decreased 2 percentage points compared to 2013 increased costs for extended warranty contracts and the service mix change with increased calibrations were the primary reasons for the lower gross margin 

research and development expenses for customer support and services represent the segment’s share of centralized investment research and development expenses were flat in both 2015 and 2014 as compared to respective prior year 

selling general and administrative expenses increased 12 percent in 2015 compared to 2014 due to increases in infrastructurerelated costs and higher field selling costs selling general and administrative expenses were flat in 2014 compared to 2013 

operating margins decreased by 5 percentage points in 2015 compared to 2014 driven by flat revenues higher infrastructurerelated costs and field selling costs operating margins decreased by 2 percentage points in 2014 compared to 2013 revenue growth was more than offset by the reductions in gross margins 

income from operations 

income from operations in 2015 decreased by 21 million or 22 percent on a revenue increase of 1 million income from operations in 2014 increased by 6 million or 6 percent on a revenue increase of 5 million 

financial condition 

liquidity and capital resources 

our financial position as of october 31 2015 consisted of cash and cash equivalents of 483 million as compared to 810 million as of october 31 2014 

as of october 31 2015 approximately 338 million of our cash and cash equivalents was held outside of the us in our foreign subsidiaries much of the nonus cash will be needed for nonus growth and expansion however some nonus cash could be repatriated to the us under current law such repatriation would be subject to us federal and state income taxes less applicable foreign tax credits we continue to be in discussions with agilent regarding the allocation of certain deferred tax liability balances related to foreign unremitted earnings in accordance with the separation agreements excess foreign tax credits associated with unremitted earnings are not recorded as an asset as they do not represent a separate deferred asset until earnings are remitted we utilize a variety of funding strategies in an effort to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed all significant international locations have access to internal funding through an offshore cashpool for working capital needs in addition to temporary local overdraft and shortterm working capital lines of credit 

     on august 13 2015 we acquired all share capital of anite for a cash price of approximately 558 million net of 43 million of cash acquired as a result of the acquisition anite has become a whollyowned subsidiary of keysight keysight funded the acquisition using existing cash the acquisition has been accounted for in accordance with the authoritative accounting guidance and the results of anite are included in keysights consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition 

  

      we believe our cash and cash equivalents cash generated from operations and ability to access capital markets and credit lines will satisfy for at least the next twelve months our liquidity requirements both globally and domestically including the 

following working capital needs capital expenditures business acquisitions contractual obligations commitments principal and interest payments on debt and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations 

net cash provided by operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities was 376 million in 2015 as compared to 563 million provided in 2014 and 566 million provided in 2013 as compared to 2014 the 187 million decrease in operating cash flow was primarily due to cash flows associated with separation from agilent and becoming an independent company including payments to agilent of 28 million in 2015 as compared to payments from agilent of 23 million in 2014 interest payments of 46 million in 2015 as compared to zero in 2014 pension contributions of 48 million as compared to zero in 2014 and income tax payments of 40 million in 2015 as compared to 4 million  in 2014  

key working capital accounts accounts receivable accounts payable and inventory had net cash outflows of 27 million in 2015 24 million in 2014 and 33 million in 2013 

we did not contribute to our us defined benefit plans in 2015 agilent contributed 15 million on our behalf to the us multiemployer plans on our behalf in each of 2014 and 2013 we contributed 48 million to the nonus defined benefit plans in 2015 and agilent contributed 41 million and 45 million on our behalf to the nonus multiemployer plans in 2014 and 2013 respectively there were no contributions to the us postretirement benefit plan or the us multiemployer postretirement health care plan in 2015 2014 and 2013 at the capitalization the assets and liabilities of the multiemployer plans that were allocable to keysight employees were transferred to keysight plans therefore the plans were no longer considered multiemployer plans 

net cash used in investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities in 2015 was 671 million as compared to cash used of 82 million in 2014 and 85 million in 2013 purchases of property plant and equipment were 92 million in 2015 70 million in 2014 and 69 million in 2013 cash used for acquisitions of businesses and intangible assets net of cash acquired was 574 million in 2015 11 million in 2014 and 1 million in 2013 in 2015 we invested 7 million in preferred stock of a privately held radio frequency microstructure company we are accounting for this investment using the cost method we purchased investments of 15 million in 2013 as compared to zero in 2014 proceeds from the sale of investment securities were 1 million in 2015 and zero in each of the fiscal years 2014 and 2013 

net cash provided byused in financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities in 2015 was 19 million compared to 335 million provided in 2014 and 481 million used in 2013 financing activities in the twelve months ended october 31 2015 reflects 26 million of proceeds from issuance of common stock under employee stock option plans and 49 million of cash returned to agilent in accordance with the separation and distribution agreement we issued senior notes of 11 billion and made a repayment of capital of 940 million to agilent in the year ended october 31 2014 

credit facility 

on september 15 2014 we entered into a fiveyear credit agreement which provides for a 300 million unsecured credit facility that will expire on november 1 2019 on july 21 2015 we entered into an accession agreement increasing the credit facility from 300 million to 450 million the company may use amounts borrowed under the facility for general corporate purposes as of october 31 2015 the company had no borrowings outstanding under the facility we were in compliance with the covenants of the credit facility during the year ended october 31 2015 

as a result of the anite acquisition we have an overdraft facility of 39 million £25 million that will expire on july 31 2016 as of october 31 2015 the company had no borrowings outstanding under the facility we were in compliance with the covenants of the credit facility from the date of acquisition to october 31 2015   

  

shortterm debt 

on july 10 2014 our wholly owned subsidiary in india entered into a shortterm loan agreement with a financial institution which provided up to 50 million of unsecured borrowings on july 25 2014 we borrowed 35 million against the loan agreement at an interest rate of 995 percent per annum the loan was repaid in fiscal 2014 and as of october 31 2014 no balance was outstanding

off balance sheet arrangements and other 

we have contractual commitments for noncancellable operating leases see note 18 commitments and contingencies to our combined and consolidated financial statements for further information on our noncancellable operating leases 

our liquidity is affected by many factors some of which are based on normal ongoing operations of our business and some of which arise from fluctuations related to global economics and markets our cash balances are generated and held in many locations throughout the world local government regulations may restrict our ability to move cash balances to meet cash needs under certain circumstances we do not currently expect such regulations and restrictions to impact our ability to pay vendors and conduct operations throughout our global organization 

contractual commitments 

our cash flows from operations are dependent on a number of factors including fluctuations in our operating results accounts receivable collections inventory management and the timing of tax and other payments as a result the impact of contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be analyzed in conjunction with such factors 

the following table summarizes our total contractual obligations at october 31 2015 in millions the amounts presented in the table do not reflect 21 million of liabilities for uncertain tax positions as of october 31 2015 we are unable to accurately predict when these amounts will be realized or released however it is reasonably possible that there could be significant changes to our unrecognized tax benefits in the next 12 months due to either the expiration of a statute of limitations or a tax audit settlement 



interest on senior notes we have contractual obligations for interest payments on our senior notes interest rates and payment dates are detailed above under longterm debt 

operating leases commitments under operating leases relate primarily to leasehold property see note 18 commitments and contingencies 

commitments to contract manufacturers and suppliers we purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products during the normal course of business we issue purchase orders with estimates of our requirements several months ahead of the delivery dates our agreements with these suppliers usually provide us with the option to cancel reschedule and adjust our requirements based on business needs prior to firm orders being placed purchase orders outstanding with delivery dates within 30 days are typically noncancellable approximately 88 percent 

  

of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements are firm noncancellable and unconditional commitments we expect to fulfill most of our purchase commitments for inventory within one year 

in addition to the commitments to contract manufacturers and suppliers referenced above we record a liability for firm noncancellable and unconditional purchase commitments for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with our policy relating to excess inventory as of october 31 2015 the liability for our excess firm noncancellable and unconditional purchase commitments was 8 million compared to 5 million as of october 31 2014 and 2013 these amounts are included in other accrued liabilities in our combined and consolidated balance sheet 

retirement plans commitments under the retirement plans relate to expected contributions to be made to our nonus defined benefit plans and to our postretirement medical plans for the next year only contributions beyond the next year are impractical to estimate 

we also have benefit payments due under our defined benefit retirement plans and postretirement benefit plan that are not required to be funded in advance but are paid in the same period that benefits are provided see item 8financial statements and supplementary data note 16 retirement plans and postretirement pension plan for additional information 

other purchase commitments     other purchase commitments relate to contracts with professional services suppliers we can typically cancel these contracts within 90 days without penalties for those contracts that are not cancellable within 90 days without penalties we are disclosing the amounts we are obligated to pay to a supplier under each contract in that period before such contract can be canceled as of october 31 2015  our contractual obligations with these suppliers was approximately 51 million within the next fiscal year as compared to approximately 33 million as of october 31 2014 

we had no material offbalance sheet arrangements as of october 31 2015 or october 31 2014 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our combined and consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable although these estimates are based on managements best knowledge of current events and actions that may impact the company in the future actual results may be different from the estimates an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur could materially change the financial statements our critical accounting policies are those that affect our financial statements materially and involve difficult subjective or complex judgments by management those policies are revenue recognition inventory valuation allocation methods and allocated expenses from agilent sharebased compensation retirement and postretirement plan assumptions valuation of goodwill and purchased intangible assets restructuring and accounting for income taxes 

revenue recognition we enter into agreements to sell products hardware andor software services and other arrangements multipleelement arrangements that include combinations of products and services revenue from product sales net of trade discounts and allowances is recognized provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured delivery is considered to have occurred when title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer for products or when the service has been provided revenue is reduced for estimated product returns when appropriate for sales that include customerspecified acceptance criteria revenue is recognized after the acceptance criteria have been met for products that include installation if the installation meets the criteria to be considered a separate element product revenue is recognized upon delivery and recognition of installation revenue occurs when the installation is complete otherwise neither the product nor the installation revenue is recognized until the installation is complete revenue from services is deferred and recognized over the contractual period or as services are rendered we allocate revenue to each element in our multipleelement arrangements based upon their relative selling prices we determine the selling price for each deliverable based on a selling price hierarchy the selling price for a deliverable is based on our vendor specific objective evidence vsoe if available thirdparty evidence tpe if vsoe is not available or estimated selling price esp if neither vsoe nor tpe is available revenue from the sale of software products that are not required to deliver the tangible products essential functionality are accounted for under software revenue recognition rules revenue allocated to each element is then recognized when the basic revenue recognition criteria for that element have been met the amount of product revenue recognized is affected by our judgments as to whether an arrangement includes multiple elements 

we use vsoe of selling price in the selling price allocation in all instances where it exists vsoe of selling price for products and services is determined when a substantial majority of the selling prices fall within a reasonable range when sold separately 

  

tpe of selling price can be established by evaluating largely interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone sales to similarly situated customers as our products contain a significant element of proprietary technology and the solution offered differs substantially from that of competitors it is difficult to obtain the reliable standalone competitive pricing necessary to establish tpe esp represents the best estimate of the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a standalone basis we determine esp for a product or service by using historical selling prices which reflect multiple factors including but not limited to customer type geography market conditions competitive landscape gross margin objectives and pricing practices the determination of esp is made through consultation with and approval by management we may modify or develop new pricing practices and strategies in the future as these pricing strategies evolve changes may occur in esp the aforementioned factors may result in a different allocation of revenue to the deliverables in multipleelement arrangements which may change the pattern and timing of revenue recognition for these elements but will not change the total revenue recognized for the arrangement 

inventory valuation we assess the valuation of our inventory on a periodic basis and make adjustments to the value for estimated excess and obsolete inventory based upon estimates about future demand and actual usage such estimates are difficult to make under most economic conditions the excess balance determined by this analysis becomes the basis for our excess inventory charge our excess inventory review process includes analysis of sales forecasts managing product rollovers and working with manufacturing to maximize recovery of excess inventory if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management additional writedowns may be required if actual market conditions are more favorable than anticipated inventory previously written down may be sold to customers resulting in lower cost of sales and higher income from operations than expected in that period 

allocations prior to the capitalization agilent allocated certain costs such as sharebased compensation expense and retirement and postretirement benefit plan expense relating to our employees and agilents corporate and shared services employees these expenses were subject to certain underlying assumptions mentioned below 

sharebased compensation we account for sharebased awards in accordance with the provisions of the authoritative accounting guidance which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all sharebased payment awards made to our employees and directors the fair value of sharebased awards for employee stock option awards was estimated using the blackscholes option pricing model shares granted under the ltp program were valued using a monte carlo simulation model both the blackscholes and monte carlo simulation fair value models require the use of highly subjective and complex assumptions including the option’s expected life and the price volatility of the underlying stock the estimated fair value of restricted stock awards is determined based on the market price of keysight’s common stock on the date of grant prior to the separation it was determined based on the market price of agilent’s common stock on the date of grant adjusted for expected dividend yield we used the average historical volatility of eleven peer companies to estimate the volatility for our stock option awards we considered our ability to find traded options of peer companies in the current market with similar terms and prices to our options for the year ended october 31 2014 and 2013 we used the historical volatility of agilent stock to estimate the volatility for stock option awards in estimating the expected life of our options we considered the historical option exercise behavior of our executives which we believe is representative of future behavior a 10 percent increase in our estimated volatility from 31 percent to 41 percent for our most recent employee stock option grant would generally increase the value of an award and the associated compensation cost by approximately 26 percent if no other factors were changed 

retirement and postretirement benefit plan assumptions   prior to the capitalization our combined and consolidated statements of operations include expense that was allocated to us based on keysight employees participating in these plans and our share of agilents corporate and shared services employee costs we consider the expense allocation methodology and results to be reasonable for all periods presented at the capitalization we established defined benefit retirement and postretirement plans for our current and former employees the defined benefit retirement and postretirement obligations relating to those participants in these plans were transferred from agilent’s plans to our defined benefit plans a proportionate share of the defined benefit plan assets was allocated from the agilent pension trust in each applicable country to a newly established keysight pension trust the share of assets allocated to us was in the same proportion as the projected benefit obligation of our participants to the total projected benefit obligation of agilent 

retirement and postretirement benefit plan costs are a significant cost of doing business they represent obligations that will ultimately be settled sometime in the future and therefore are subject to estimation pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the employees average expected future service to keysight based on the terms of the plans and investment and funding decisions to estimate the impact of these future payments and our decisions concerning funding of these obligations we are required to make assumptions using actuarial concepts within the framework of accounting principles generally accepted in the us two critical assumptions are the discount rate and the expected longterm return on plan assets other important assumptions include expected future salary increases expected future increases to benefit payments expected retirement dates employee turnover retiree mortality rates and investment portfolio composition we evaluate these assumptions at least annually 

  

the discount rate is used to determine the present value of future benefit payments at the measurement date which is october 31 for both us and nonus plans the us discount rates at october 31 2015 and 2014 were determined based on the results of matching expected plan benefit payments with cash flows from a hypothetically constructed bond portfolio the nonus discount rates at october 31 2015  were determined using spot rates along the yield curve to calculate disaggregated discount rates in addition we used this method to calculate two components of the periodic benefit cost service cost and interest cost the nonus discount rates at october 31 2014 were generally based on published rates for highquality corporate bonds if we changed our discount rate by 1 percent the impact would be 4 million on us net periodic benefit cost and 13 million on nonus net periodic benefit cost lower discount rates increase the present value of the liability and subsequent year pension expense higher discount rates decrease the present value of the liability and subsequent year pension expense 

the company uses alternate methods of amortization as allowed by the authoritative guidance that amortizes the actuarial gains and losses on a consistent basis for the years presented for us plans gains and losses are amortized over the average future working lifetime for most nonus plans and us postretirement benefit plans gains and losses are amortized using a separate layer for each years gains and losses the expected longterm return on plan assets is estimated using current and expected asset allocations as well as historical and expected returns plan assets are valued at fair value if we changed our estimated return on assets by 1 percent the impact would be 6 million on us net periodic benefit cost and 13 million on nonus net periodic benefit cost 

goodwill and other intangible assets   we review goodwill for impairment annually during our fourth fiscal quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable as defined in the authoritative guidance a reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment we aggregated components of an operating segment that have similar economic characteristics into our reporting units at the time of an acquisition we assign goodwill to the reporting unit that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination 

companies have the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether performing the twostep quantitative test is necessary if an entity believes as a result of its qualitative assessment that it is morelikelythannot ie  50 chance that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount the quantitative impairment test will be required otherwise no further testing will be required 

the guidance includes examples of events and circumstances that might indicate that a reporting units fair value is less than its carrying amount these examples include macroeconomic conditions such as deterioration in the entitys operating environment or industry or market considerations entityspecific events such as increasing costs declining financial performance or loss of key personnel or other events such as an expectation that a reporting unit will be sold or a sustained decrease in the stock price on either an absolute basis or relative to peers the qualitative indicators replace those previously used to determine whether an interim goodwill impairment test is required if it is determined as a result of the qualitative assessment that it is morelikelythannot that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount the provisions of authoritative guidance require that we perform a twostep impairment test on goodwill in the first step we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value the second step if necessary measures the amount of impairment by applying fairvaluebased tests to the individual assets and liabilities within each reporting unit 

historically we conducted our business in a single operating segment and reporting unit in fiscal 2014 in conjunction with the planned separation we implemented changes in our organizational structure which resulted in the formation of two reportable operating segments in fiscal year 2015 we assessed goodwill impairment for our two reporting units which consisted of our two segments measurement solutions and customer support and services we performed a qualitative test of goodwill impairment for both reporting units as of september 30 2015 based on the results of our testing it was determined that it is morelikelythannot that the fair value of the reporting units are greater than their carrying amounts there was no impairment of goodwill during the years ended october 31 2015 2014 and 2013 each quarter we review the events and circumstances to determine if goodwill impairment is indicated 

other intangible assets consist primarily of developed technologies proprietary knowhow trademarks and customer relationships and are amortized using the straightline method over estimated useful lives ranging from 6  months to 15  years no impairments of purchased intangible assets were recorded during the years ended october 31 2015 2014 and 2013 

we review other intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of these assets are no longer appropriate the authoritative accounting guidance allows a qualitative approach for testing indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment similar to the impairment testing guidance for goodwill it allows the option to first assess qualitative factors events and circumstances that could have affected the significant inputs used in determining the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset the qualitative factors assist in determining whether it is morelikelythannot ie  50 chance that the indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired an organization may choose to bypass the qualitative assessment for any indefinitelived intangible asset in any 

  

period and proceed directly to calculating its fair value our indefinitelived intangible assets are iprd intangible assets due to specific cancellation of an iprd project we recorded an impairment of 1 million in 2013 there were no impairments in fiscal years 2015 and 2014 in all other instances we used the qualitative test and concluded that it was morelikelythannot that all other indefinitelived assets were not impaired 

warranty our standard warranty term for most of our products from the date of delivery is typically three years which increased from one year in the second quarter of fiscal 2013 we accrue for standard warranty costs based on historical trends in warranty charges as a percentage of net product revenue the accrual is reviewed regularly and periodically adjusted to reflect changes in warranty cost estimates estimated warranty charges are recorded within cost of products at the time related product revenue is recognized 

we also sell extended warranties that provide warranty coverage beyond the standard warranty term revenue associated with extended warranties is deferred and recognized over the extended coverage period 

restructuring the main component of our restructuring plan is related to workforce reductions workforce reduction charges are accrued when payment of benefits becomes probable and the amounts can be estimated if the amounts and timing of cash flows from restructuring activities are significantly different from what we have estimated the actual amount of restructuring and other related charges could be materially different either higher or lower than those we have recorded 

accounting for income taxes we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits benefits and deductions and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes as well as interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period 

significant management judgment is also required in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part when it is morelikelythannot that all or some portion of specific deferred tax assets such as net operating losses or foreign tax credit carryforwards will not be realized a valuation allowance must be established for the amount of the deferred tax assets that cannot be realized we consider all available positive and negative evidence on a jurisdictionbyjurisdiction basis when assessing whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable we consider evidence such as our past operating results the existence of losses in recent years and our forecast of future taxable income at october 31 2015 the company maintains a valuation allowance mainly related to deferred tax assets for acquired capital losses in the uk we intend to maintain a valuation allowance in these jurisdictions until sufficient positive evidence exists to support its reversal 

we have provided for all us federal income and foreign withholding taxes on the undistributed earnings of some of our foreign subsidiaries for the portion of earnings we do not intend to reinvest permanently for the amount of foreign earnings that we consider reinvested permanently should we decide to remit this income to the us in a future period our provision for income taxes will increase materially in that period 

the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax law and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions although the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes the use of a recognition and measurement model the determination of whether an uncertain tax position has met those thresholds will continue to require significant judgment by management in accordance with the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes for all us and other tax jurisdictions we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes and interest will be due the ultimate resolution of tax uncertainties may differ from what is currently estimated which could result in a material impact on income tax expense if our estimate of income tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment a further charge to expense would be required if events occur and the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary we include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes in the combined and consolidated statements of operations 

for fiscal 2014 and prior we have calculated our taxes on a separate return basis however the amounts recorded for fiscal 2014 and prior are not necessarily representative of the amounts that would have been reflected in the financial statements had we been an entity that operated independent of agilent consequently our results after our separation from agilent may be materially different from our historical results

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

at various times we use derivative financial instruments to limit exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates because derivative instruments are used solely as hedges and not for speculative trading purposes fluctuations in the market values of such derivative instruments are generally offset by reciprocal changes in the underlying economic exposures that the instruments are intended to hedge for further discussion of derivative financial instruments refer to note 14 derivatives 

currency exchange rate risk 

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks inherent in our sales commitments anticipated sales and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries we hedge future cash flows denominated in currencies other than the functional currency using sales and expense forecasts up to twelve months in advance our exposure to exchange rate risks is managed on an enterprisewide basis this strategy utilizes derivative financial instruments including option and forward contracts to hedge certain foreign currency exposures with the intent of offsetting gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposures with gains and losses on the derivative contracts hedging them we do not currently and do not intend to utilize derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes 

our operations generate nonfunctional currency cash flows such as revenues thirdparty vendor payments and intercompany payments in anticipation of these foreign currency cash flows and in view of the volatility of the currency market we enter into such foreign exchange contracts as described above to substantially mitigate our currency risk approximately 75 percent of our revenues in 2015 74 percent of our revenues in 2014 and 75 percent of our revenues in 2013 were generated in us dollars 

we performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10 percent adverse movement in foreign exchange rates to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above as of october 31 2015  and 2014 the analysis indicated that these hypothetical market movements would not have a material effect on our combined and consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

interest rate risk 

as of october 31 2015 we had 1100 million in principal amount of fixedrate senior notes outstanding the carrying amount of the senior notes was 1099 million and the related fair value based on quoted prices was 1091 million a change in interest rates on longterm debt impacts the fair value of the company’s fixedrate longterm debt but not the company’s earnings or cash flow because the interest on such debt is fixed generally the fair market value of fixedrate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 

as of october 31 2015 a hypothetical 10 percent increase in interest rates would have decreased the fair value of the company’s fixedrate longterm debt by approximately 26 million however since the company currently has no plans to repurchase its outstanding fixedrate instruments before their maturity nor do the investors in our fixedrate debt obligations have the right to demand we pay off these obligations prior to maturity the impact of market interest rate fluctuations on the company’s fixedrate longterm debt does not affect the company’s results of operations or stockholders’ equity

we compete with regional and country‑specific test instrument service providers and government measurement laboratories that are not original equipment manufacturers our primary competitors are trescal limited tektronix instrument calibration services and ceprei laboratories due to differing country and regulatory accreditation standards the services provided may vary greatly 

our refurbished instruments business faces competition from other electronic measurement instrument competitors with trade‑in programs and from numerous rental companies equipment dealers brokers and resellers 

the following discussions of research and development backlog intellectual property materials environmental and international operations include information common to each of our businesses 

research and development 

research and development rd expenditures were 361 million in 2014  375 million in 2013 and  377 million in 2012 we anticipate that we will continue to have significant rd expenditures in order to maintain our competitive position with a continuing flow of innovative highquality products and services we remain committed to investing in research and development and have focused our development efforts on key strategic opportunities in order to align our business with available markets and position ourselves to grow in our markets 

       our rd efforts focus on potential new products and product improvements covering a wide variety of technologies none of which is individually significant to our operations we conduct four types of rd applied research in enabling technologies communications simulation and measurement our research seeks to improve on various technical competencies in electronics software systems and solutions in each of these research fields we conduct research that is focused on specific product development for release in the shortterm as well as other research that is intended to be the foundation for future products over a longer time horizon product development research investments support new product introductions improvements to existing products and development of products to meet future market opportunities due to the breadth of research and development projects across all of our businesses there are a number of drivers of this expense 

backlog 

backlog represents the amount of revenue expected from orders that have already been booked including orders for goods and services that have not been delivered to customers orders invoiced but not yet recognized as revenue and orders for goods that were shipped but not invoiced awaiting acceptance by customers 

at october 31 2014 our unfilled backlog was approximately 781 million as compared to approximately 761 million at october 31 2013 we expect that a majority of the unfilled backlog will be recognized as revenue within six months on average our unfilled backlog represents approximately three months worth of revenue we believe backlog on any particular date while indicative of shortterm revenue performance is not necessarily a reliable indicator of medium or longterm revenue performance 

intellectual property 

we generate patent and other intellectual property rights covering significant inventions and other innovations in order to create a competitive advantage although we believe that our licenses patents and other intellectual property rights have value in general no single license patent or other intellectual property right is in itself material other than the keysight mark in addition our intellectual property rights may be challenged invalidated or circumvented or may otherwise not provide significant competitive advantage 

  

materials 

our manufacturing operations employ a wide variety of semiconductors electromechanical components and assemblies and raw materials such as plastic resins and sheet metal we purchase materials from thousands of suppliers on a global basis some of the parts that require custom design work are not readily available from alternate suppliers due to their unique design or the length of time necessary for design work our longterm relationships with suppliers allow us to proactively manage technology road maps and product discontinuance plans and monitor their financial health even so some suppliers may still extend their lead times limit supplies increase prices or cease to produce necessary parts for our products if these are unique components we may not be able to find a substitute quickly or at all to address the potential disruption in our supply chain we use a number of techniques including qualifying multiple sources of supply and redesign of products for alternative components in addition while we generally attempt to keep our inventory at minimal levels we do purchase incremental inventory as circumstances warrant to protect the supply chain 

environmental 

our rd manufacturing and distribution operations involve the use of hazardous substances and are regulated under international federal state and local laws governing health and safety and the environment we apply strict standards for protection of the environment and occupational health and safety to sites inside and outside the united states even if not subject to regulation imposed by foreign governments we believe that our properties and operations at our facilities comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and occupational health and safety laws however the risk of environmental liabilities cannot be completely eliminated and there can be no assurance that the application of environmental and health and safety laws will not require us to incur significant expenditures we are also regulated under a number of international federal state and local laws regarding recycling product packaging and product content requirements the environmental product contentdisposal and recycling laws are gradually becoming more stringent and may cause us to incur significant expenditures in the future 

some of our properties are undergoing remediation by hewlettpackard company hp for subsurface contaminations that were known at the time of agilent’s separation from hp in 1999 in connection with agilent’s separation from hp hp and agilent entered into an agreement pursuant to which hp agreed to retain the liability for this subsurface contamination perform the required remediation and indemnify agilent with respect to claims arising out of that contamination agilent has assigned its rights and obligations under this agreement to keysight in respect of facilities transferred to keysight in the separation as a result hp has access to a limited number of our properties to perform remediation although hp agreed to minimize interference with onsite operations at such properties remediation activities and subsurface contamination may require us to incur unreimbursed costs and could harm onsite operations and the future use and value of the properties in connection with the separation agilent will indemnify us directly for any liabilities related thereto we cannot be sure that hp will continue to fulfill its remediation obligations or that agilent will continue to fulfill its indemnification obligations 

in connection with the separation agilent will also indemnify us for any liability associated with contamination from past operations at all properties transferred from agilent to us we cannot be sure that agilent will fulfill its indemnification obligations 

we maintain a comprehensive environmental site liability insurance policy which may cover certain cleanup costs or legal claims related to environmental contamination this policy covers specified active inactive and divested locations 

international operations 

our net revenue originating outside the united states as a percentage of our total net revenue was approximately 64 percent in fiscal 2014 67 percent in fiscal 2013 and 63 percent in fiscal 2012 the majority of which was from customers other than foreign governments revenues from external customers are generally attributed to regions based upon the location of our sales representative 

longlived assets located outside of the united states as a percentage of our total longlived assets was approximately 64 percent in fiscal year 2014 and 63 percent in fiscal year 2013 approximately 26 and 23  percent of our longlived assets were located in japan in fiscal years 2014 and 2013 respectively approximately 14 and 18 percent of our longlived assets were located in malaysia in fiscal years 2014 and 2013 respectively 

most of our sales in international markets are made by foreign sales subsidiaries in countries with low sales volumes sales are made through various representatives and distributors however we also sell into international markets directly from the united states 

our international business is subject to risks customarily encountered in foreign operations including interruption to transportation flows for delivery of parts to us and finished goods to our customers changes in a specific countrys or regions political or economic conditions trade protection measures import or export licensing requirements consequences from changes 

  

in tax laws and regulatory requirements difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations differing labor regulations differing protection of intellectual property and geopolitical turmoil including terrorism and war we are also exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in our sales commitments anticipated sales and expenses and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the local functional currency and may also become subject to interest rate risk inherent in any debt we incur or investment portfolios we hold there may be an increased risk of political unrest in regions where we have significant manufacturing operations such as southeast asia however we believe that our international diversification provides stability to our worldwide operations and reduces the impact on us of adverse economic changes in any single country financial information about our international operations is contained in note 20 segment information to our combined and consolidated financial statements

 item 1a risk factors 

risks uncertainties and other factors that may affect future results 

risks related to our business 

depressed and uncertain general economic conditions may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

our business is sensitive to negative changes in general economic conditions both inside and outside the united states the continued economic downturn may adversely impact our business resulting in 

 our operating results and financial condition could be harmed if the markets into which we sell our products decline or do not grow as anticipated 

visibility into our markets is limited our quarterly sales and operating results are highly dependent on the volume and timing of technologyrelated spending and orders received during the fiscal quarter which are difficult to forecast and may be cancelled by our customers in addition our revenues and earnings forecasts for future fiscal quarters are often based on the expected seasonality or cyclicality of our markets however the markets we serve do not always experience the seasonality or cyclicality that we expect any decline in our customers markets would likely result in a reduction in demand for our products and services 

  

the broader semiconductor market is one of the drivers for our business and therefore a decrease in the semiconductor market could harm our business also if our customers markets decline we may not be able to collect on outstanding amounts due to us such declines could harm our financial position results of operations cash flows and stock price and could limit our profitability also in such an environment pricing pressures could intensify since a significant portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed in nature due to sales rd and manufacturing costs if we were unable to respond quickly enough these pricing pressures could further reduce our operating margins 

if we do not introduce successful new products and services in a timely manner to address increased competition rapid technological changes and changing industry standards our products and services will become obsolete and our operating results will suffer 

we generally sell our products in industries that are characterized by increased competition through frequent new product and service introductions rapid technological changes and changing industry standards in addition many of the markets in which we operate are seasonal and cyclical without the timely introduction of new products services and enhancements our products and services will become technologically obsolete over time in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer the success of new products and services will depend on several factors including our ability to 

 dependence on contract manufacturing and outsourcing other portions of our supply chain may adversely affect our ability to bring products to market and damage our reputation dependence on outsourced information technology and other administrative functions may impair our ability to operate effectively 

as part of our efforts to streamline operations and to cut costs we outsource aspects of our manufacturing processes and other functions and continue to evaluate additional outsourcing if our contract manufacturers or other outsourcers fail to perform their obligations in a timely manner or at satisfactory quality levels our ability to bring products to market and our reputation could suffer for example during a market upturn our contract manufacturers may be unable to meet our demand requirements which may preclude us from fulfilling our customers orders on a timely basis the ability of these manufacturers to perform is largely outside of our control additionally changing or replacing our contract manufacturers or other outsourcees could cause disruptions or delays in addition we outsource significant portions of our information technology it and other administrative functions since it is critical to our operations any failure to perform on the part of our it providers could impair our ability to operate effectively in addition to the risks outlined above problems with manufacturing or it outsourcing could result in lower revenues and unrealized efficiencies and could impact our results of operations and stock price much of our outsourcing takes place in developing countries and as a result may be subject to geopolitical uncertainty 

failure to adjust our purchases due to changing market conditions or failure to estimate our customers demand could adversely affect our income 

our income could be harmed if we are unable to adjust our purchases to market fluctuations including those caused by the seasonal or cyclical nature of the markets in which we operate the sale of our products and services are dependent to a large degree on customers whose industries are subject to seasonal or cyclical trends in the demand for their products for example the consumer electronics market is particularly volatile making demand difficult to anticipate during a market upturn we may not be able to purchase sufficient supplies or components to meet increasing product demand which could materially affect our results in the past we have seen a shortage of parts for some of our products in addition some of the parts that require custom design are not readily available from alternate suppliers due to their unique design or the length of time necessary for design work should a supplier cease manufacturing such a component we would be forced to reengineer our product in addition to discontinuing parts suppliers may also extend lead times limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors in order to secure components for the production of products we may continue to enter into noncancellable purchase commitments with vendors or at times make advance payments to suppliers which could impact our ability to adjust our inventory to declining market demands prior commitments of this type have resulted in an excess of parts when demand for communications and electronics products has decreased if demand for our products is less than we expect we may experience additional excess and obsolete inventories and be forced to incur additional charges 

  

our operating results may suffer if our manufacturing capacity does not match the demand for our products 

because we cannot immediately adapt our production capacity and related cost structures to rapidly changing market conditions when demand does not meet our expectations our manufacturing capacity will likely exceed our production requirements if during a general market upturn or an upturn in our business we cannot increase our manufacturing capacity to meet product demand we will not be able to fulfill orders in a timely manner which could lead to order cancellations contract breaches or indemnification obligations this inability could materially and adversely limit our ability to improve our income margin and operating results by contrast if during an economic downturn we had excess manufacturing capacity then our fixed costs associated with excess manufacturing capacity would adversely affect our income margins and operating results 

economic political and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our results of operations 

because we sell our products worldwide our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally we anticipate that revenue from international operations will continue to represent a majority of our total revenue in addition many of our employees contract manufacturers suppliers job functions and manufacturing facilities are located outside the united states accordingly our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors including 

 we centralize most of our accounting processes at two locations india and malaysia these processes include general accounting inventory cost accounting accounts payable and accounts receivables functions if conditions change in those countries it may adversely affect operations including impairing our ability to pay our suppliers our results of operations as well as our liquidity may be adversely affected and possible delays may occur in reporting financial results 

additionally we must comply with complex foreign and us laws and regulations such as the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials and anticompetition regulations violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties criminal sanctions restrictions on our business conduct and on our ability to offer our products in one or more countries and could also materially affect our brand ability to attract and retain employees international operations business and operating results although we plan to implement policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations there can be no assurance that our employees contractors or agents will not violate these policies and procedures 

in addition although a substantial amount of our products are priced and paid for in us dollars many of our products are priced in local currencies and a significant amount of certain types of expenses such as payroll utilities tax and marketing expenses are paid in local currencies our hedging programs are designed to reduce but not always entirely eliminate within any given 12month period the impact of currency exchange rate movements including those caused by currency controls which could impact our business operating results and financial condition by resulting in lower revenue or increased expenses however for expenses beyond a 12month period our hedging strategy will not mitigate our exchange rate risk in addition our currency hedging programs involve thirdparty financial institutions as counterparties the weakening or failure of these counterparties may adversely affect our hedging programs and our financial condition through among other things a reduction in the number of available counterparties increasingly unfavorable terms or the failure of counterparties to perform under hedging contracts 

significant key customers or large orders may expose us to additional business and legal risks that could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition  

certain significant key customers have substantial purchasing power and leverage in negotiating contractual arrangements with us these customers may demand contract terms that differ considerably from our standard terms and conditions large orders may also include severe contractual liabilities for us if we fail to provide the quantity and quality of product at the required delivery times while we attempt to contractually limit our potential liability under such contracts we may have to agree to some or all of these types of provisions to secure these orders and to continue to grow our business such actions expose us to significant additional risks which could result in a material adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition 

  

our business will suffer if we are not able to retain and hire key personnel 

our future success depends partly on the continued service of our key research engineering sales marketing manufacturing executive and administrative personnel if we fail to retain and hire a sufficient number of these personnel we may not be able to maintain or expand our business the markets in which we operate are dynamic and we may need to respond with reorganizations workforce reductions and site closures from time to time we believe our pay levels are competitive within the regions that we operate however there is also intense competition for certain highly technical specialties in geographic areas in which we operate and it may become more difficult to retain key employees 

environmental contamination from past operations could subject us to unreimbursed costs and could harm onsite operations and the future use and value of the properties involved and environmental contamination caused by ongoing operations could subject us to substantial liabilities in the future 

some of our properties are undergoing remediation by hp for subsurface contaminations that were known at the time of agilents separation from hp in 1999 in connection with agilents separation from hp hp and agilent entered into an agreement pursuant to which hp agreed to retain the liability for this subsurface contamination perform the required remediation and indemnify agilent with respect to claims arising out of that contamination agilent has assigned its rights and obligations under this agreement to keysight in respect of facilities transferred to us in the separation as a result hp will have access to a limited number of our properties to perform remediation although hp agreed to minimize interference with onsite operations at such properties remediation activities and subsurface contamination may require us to incur unreimbursed costs and could harm onsite operations and the future use and value of the properties in connection with the separation agilent will indemnify us directly for any liabilities related thereto we cannot be sure that hp will continue to fulfill its remediation obligations or that agilent will continue to fulfill its indemnification obligations 

in connection with the separation agilent also agreed to indemnify us for any liability associated with contamination from past operations at all properties transferred from agilent to keysight we cannot be sure that agilent will fulfill its indemnification obligations 

our current manufacturing processes involve the use of substances regulated under various international federal state and local laws governing the environment as a result we may become subject to liabilities for environmental contamination and these liabilities may be substantial although our policy is to apply strict standards for environmental protection at our sites inside and outside the united states even if the sites outside the united states are not subject to regulations imposed by foreign governments we may not be aware of all conditions that could subject us to liability 

we and our customers are subject to various governmental regulations compliance with which may cause us to incur significant expenses and if we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with certain regulations we may be forced to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution and we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties 

we and our customers are subject to various significant international federal state and local regulations including but not limited to health and safety packaging product content labor and importexport regulations these regulations are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time we may be required to incur significant expenses to comply with these regulations or to remedy violations of these regulations any failure by us to comply with applicable government regulations could also result in cessation of our operations or portions of our operations product recalls or impositions of fines and restrictions on our ability to carry on or expand our operations if demand for our products is adversely affected or our costs increase our business would suffer 

our products and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies like the international standards organization as well as regulation by other agencies such as the us federal communications commission we also must comply with work safety rules if we fail to adequately address any of these regulations our businesses could be harmed 

third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property rights and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products or services 

from time to time third parties may claim that one or more of our products or services infringe their intellectual property rights we analyze and take action in response to such claims on a casebycase basis any dispute or litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and timeconsuming due to the complexity of our technology and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation and could divert our management and key personnel from business operations a claim of intellectual property infringement could cause us to enter into a costly or restrictive license agreement which may not be available under acceptable terms or at all require us to redesign certain of our products which would be costly and timeconsuming andor subject us to significant damages or an injunction against the development and sale of certain products or services in certain of our businesses we rely on thirdparty intellectual property licenses and we cannot ensure that these licenses will be available to us in the future on terms favorable to us or at all 

  

third parties may infringe our intellectual property rights and we may suffer competitive injury or expend significant resources enforcing our intellectual property rights 

our success depends in part on our proprietary technology including technology we obtained through acquisitions we rely on various intellectual property rights including patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets as well as confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish our proprietary rights if we do not enforce our intellectual property rights successfully our competitive position may suffer which could harm our operating results 

our pending patent copyright and trademark registration applications may not be allowed or competitors may challenge the validity or scope of our patents copyrights or trademarks in addition our patents copyrights trademarks and other intellectual property rights may not provide us with a significant competitive advantage in preparation for the separation and distribution we have applied for trademarks related to our new global brand name in various jurisdictions worldwide any successful opposition to our applications in material jurisdictions could impose material costs on us or make it more difficult to protect our brand different jurisdictions vary widely in the level of protection and priority they give to trademark and other intellectual property rights 

we may be required to spend significant resources monitoring our intellectual property rights and we may or may not be able to detect infringement of such rights by third parties our competitive position may be harmed if we cannot detect infringement and enforce our intellectual property rights in a timely manner or at all in some circumstances we may choose to not pursue enforcement due to a variety of reasons in addition competitors may avoid infringement by designing around our intellectual property rights or by developing noninfringing competing technologies intellectual property rights and our ability to enforce them may be unavailable or limited in some countries which could make it easier for competitors to capture market share and could result in lost revenues to the company furthermore some of our intellectual property is licensed to others which allows them to compete with us using that intellectual property 

we are or will be subject to ongoing tax examinations of our tax returns by the irs and other tax authorities an adverse outcome of any such audit or examination by the irs or other tax authority could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

we are or will be subject to ongoing tax examinations of our tax returns by the irs and other tax authorities in various jurisdictions we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from ongoing tax examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes these assessments can require considerable estimates and judgments intercompany transactions associated with the sale of inventory services intellectual property and cost sharing arrangements are complex and affect our tax liabilities the calculation of our tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in multiple jurisdictions the outcomes of any tax examinations could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition due to the complexity of tax contingencies the ultimate resolution of any tax matters related to operations postseparation may result in payments greater or less than amounts accrued 

our effective tax rate may be adversely impacted by among other things changes in the mix of our earnings among countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets and changes in tax laws we cannot give any assurance as to what our effective tax rate will be in the future because of among other things uncertainty regarding the tax policies of the jurisdictions where we operate in addition we may be impacted by changes in tax laws including tax rate changes changes to the laws related to the treatment and remittance of foreign earnings new tax laws and subsequent interpretations of tax law in the united states and other jurisdictions 

if tax incentives change or cease to be in effect our income taxes could increase significantly 

we benefit from tax incentives extended to our foreign subsidiaries to encourage investment or employment several jurisdictions have granted or are anticipated to grant us tax incentives that require renewal at various times in the future the most significant being in singapore we do not expect incentives granted by other tax authorities to have a material impact on the financial statements the specific conditions of the tax incentives with singapore are being negotiated and have not been finally agreed however we expect that these conditions will be different from those currently agreed between agilent and singapore and will include achieving different thresholds of employment ownership of certain assets as well as specific types of investment activities within singapore we believe that we will satisfy such conditions in the future 

our taxes could increase if the incentives are not granted or renewed upon expiration if we cannot or do not wish to satisfy all or portions of the tax incentive conditions we may lose the related tax incentive and could be required to refund tax incentives previously realized as a result our effective tax rate could be higher than it would have been had we maintained the benefits of the tax incentives 

  

if we suffer a loss to our factories facilities or distribution system due to a catastrophic event our operations could be significantly harmed 

our factories facilities and distribution system are subject to catastrophic loss due to fire flood terrorism or other natural or manmade disasters in particular several of our facilities could be subject to a catastrophic loss caused by earthquake or other natural disasters due to their locations for example our production facilities headquarters and laboratories in california and our production facilities in japan are all located in areas with aboveaverage seismic activity if any of these facilities were to experience a catastrophic loss it could disrupt our operations delay production shipments and revenue and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility if such a disruption were to occur we could breach our agreements our reputation could be harmed and our business and operating results could be adversely affected in addition since we have consolidated our manufacturing facilities we are more likely to experience an interruption to our operations in the event of a catastrophe in any one location although we carry insurance for property damage and business interruption we do not carry insurance or financial reserves for interruptions or potential losses arising from earthquakes or terrorism also our thirdparty insurance coverage will vary from time to time in both type and amount depending on availability cost and our decision with respect to risk retention economic conditions and uncertainties in global markets may adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain thirdparty insurance if our thirdparty insurance coverage is adversely affected or to the extent we have elected to selfinsure we may be at a greater risk that our operations will be harmed by a catastrophic loss 

as we build our information technology infrastructure and transition our data to our own system if we experience a significant disruption in or breach in security of our information technology systems or if we fail to implement new systems and software successfully our business could be adversely affected 

we are in the process of transitioning from agilent’s information technology system to our own system during the first half of fiscal year 2015 we rely on several centralized information technology systems to provide products and services maintain financial records process orders manage inventory process shipments to customers and operate other critical functions if we cannot transition effectively from agilent’s existing system and were to experience a prolonged system disruption in the information technology systems that involve our interactions with customers or suppliers it could result in the loss of sales and customers and significant incremental costs which could adversely affect our business in addition our information technology systems may be susceptible to damage disruptions or shutdowns due to power outages hardware failures computer viruses attacks by computer hackers telecommunication failures user errors catastrophes or other unforeseen events furthermore security breaches of our information technology systems could result in the misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to the company or our employees partners customers or suppliers which could result in significant financial or reputational damage to the company 

our business and financial results may be adversely affected by various legal and regulatory proceedings 

we are subject to legal proceedings lawsuits and other claims in the normal course of business and could become subject to additional claims in the future some of which could be material the outcome of existing proceedings lawsuits and claims may differ from our expectations because the outcomes of litigation are often difficult to reliably predict various factors or developments can lead us to change current estimates of liabilities and related insurance receivables where applicable or permit us to make such estimates for matters previously not susceptible to reasonable estimates such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment a significant settlement significant regulatory developments or changes in applicable law a future adverse ruling settlement or unfavorable development could result in charges that could adversely affect our business operating results or financial condition 

our acquisitions strategic alliances joint ventures and divestitures may result in financial results that are different than expected 

in the normal course of business we may engage in discussions with third parties relating to possible acquisitions strategic alliances joint ventures and divestitures as a result of such transactions our financial results may differ from our own or the investment communitys expectations in a given fiscal quarter or over the long term if market conditions or other factors lead us to change our strategic direction we may not realize the expected value from such transactions further such transactions often have postclosing arrangements including but not limited to postclosing adjustments transition services escrows or indemnifications the financial results of which can be difficult to predict in addition acquisitions and strategic alliances may require us to integrate a different company culture management team and business infrastructure we may have difficulty developing manufacturing and marketing the products of a newly acquired company in a way that enhances the performance of our businesses or product lines to realize the value from expected synergies depending on the size and complexity of an acquisition the successful integration of the entity depends on a variety of factors including 

 17 

  

if we do not realize the expected benefits or synergies of such transactions our combined and consolidated financial position results of operations cash flows and stock price could be negatively impacted 

in addition effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable and accurate financial reports and to effectively prevent fraud we anticipate devoting significant resources and time to comply with the internal control over financial reporting requirements of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 however we cannot be certain that these measures will ensure that we design implement and maintain adequate control over our financial processes and reporting in the future especially in the context of acquisitions of other businesses any difficulties in the assimilation of acquired businesses into our control system could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations inferior internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our stock and our access to capital all of these efforts require varying levels of management resources which may divert our attention from other business operations 

we have substantial cash requirements in the united states although most of our cash is generated outside of the united states the failure to maintain a level of cash sufficient to address our cash requirements in the united states could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

although the cash generated in the united states from our operations including any cash and nonpermanently invested earnings repatriated to the united states is expected to cover our normal operating requirements and debt service requirements a substantial amount of additional cash may be required for special purposes such as the maturity of our current and future debt obligations any dividends that may be declared any future stock repurchase programs and any acquisitions if we encounter a significant need for liquidity domestically or at a particular location that we cannot fulfill through borrowings equity offerings or other internal or external sources we may incur unfavorable tax and earnings consequences these adverse consequences would occur for example if the transfer of cash into the united states is taxed and no foreign tax credit is available to offset the us tax liability resulting in higher taxes foreign exchange ceilings imposed by local governments and the sometimes lengthy approval processes that foreign governments require for international cash transfers may delay our internal cash transfers from time to time these factors may cause us to have an overall tax rate higher than our tax rates have been in the past our business operating results financial condition and strategic initiatives could be adversely impacted if we are unable to address our us cash requirements through the efficient and timely repatriations of overseas cash or other sources of cash obtained at a cost and on other terms acceptable to us 

we have outstanding debt and may incur other debt in the future which could adversely affect our financial condition liquidity and results of operations 

we currently have outstanding debt as well as availability to borrow under a revolving credit facility we may borrow additional amounts in the future and use the proceeds from any future borrowing for general corporate purposes future acquisitions expansion of our business or repurchases of our outstanding shares of common stock 

our incurrence of this debt and increases in our aggregate levels of debt may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition by among other things 

 our current revolving credit facility imposes restrictions on us including restrictions on our ability to create liens on our assets and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur indebtedness and requires us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios our ability to comply with these ratios may be affected by events beyond our control in addition the indenture governing our senior notes contains covenants that may adversely affect our ability to incur certain liens or engage in certain types of sale and leaseback transactions if we breach any of the covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders then subject to applicable cure periods our outstanding indebtedness could be declared immediately due and payable 

we may need additional financing in the future to meet our capital needs or to make opportunistic acquisitions and such financing may not be available on terms favorable to us if at all and may be dilutive to existing shareholders 

we may need to seek additional financing for our general corporate purposes for example we may need to increase our investment in rd activities or need funds to make acquisitions we may be unable to obtain any desired additional financing on terms favorable to us if at all if adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms we may be unable to fund our expansion successfully develop or enhance products or respond to competitive pressures any of which could negatively affect our business if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity securities our shareholders will experience dilution of their ownership interest if we raise additional funds by issuing debt we may be subject to further limitations on our operations and ability to pay dividends due to restrictive covenants 

  

adverse conditions in the global banking industry and credit markets may adversely impact the value of our cash investments or impair our liquidity 

as of the distribution we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately 810 million invested or held in a mix of money market funds time deposit accounts and bank demand deposit accounts disruptions in the financial markets may in some cases result in an inability to access assets such as money market funds that traditionally have been viewed as highly liquid any failure of our counterparty financial institutions or funds in which we have invested may adversely impact our cash and cash equivalent positions and in turn our results and financial condition 

future investment returns on pension assets may be lower than expected or interest rates may decline requiring us to make significant additional cash contributions to our future plans 

we sponsor several defined benefit pension plans that cover many of our salaried and hourly employees the federal pension protection act of 2006 requires that certain capitalization levels be maintained in each of the us plans and there may be similar funding requirements in the plans outside the united states because it is unknown what the investment return on pension assets will be in future years or what interest rates may be at any point in time no assurances can be given that applicable law will not require us to make future material plan contributions any such contributions could adversely affect our financial condition 

risks related to the separation 

we have no history of operating as an independent company and our historical financial information is not necessarily representative of the results that we would have achieved as a separate publiclytraded company and may not be a reliable indicator of our future results 

the historical information about the company prior to fiscal year 2015 refers to our business as operated by and integrated with agilent our historical financial information included in this form 10k is derived from the consolidated financial statements and accounting records of agilent accordingly the historical financial information does not necessarily reflect the financial condition results of operations or cash flows that we would have achieved as a separate publiclytraded company during the periods presented or those that we will achieve in the future primarily as a result of the factors described below 

 other significant changes may occur in our cost structure management financing and business operations as a result of operating as a company separate from agilent for additional information about the past financial performance of our business and the basis of presentation of the historical combined and consolidated financial statements see selected historical combined and consolidated financial data managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and the historical financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this form 10k 

potential indemnification liabilities to agilent pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the separation and distribution agreement provides for among other things indemnification obligations designed to make us financially responsible for any liabilities associated with assets used by our business our failure to pay perform or otherwise promptly discharge any such liabilities or contracts in accordance with their respective terms whether prior to at or after the 

  

distribution any guarantee indemnification obligation surety bond or other credit support agreement arrangement commitment or understanding by agilent for our benefit unless they are liabilities related to assets used in the agilent business any breach by us of the separation agreement or any of the ancillary agreements or any action by us in contravention of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws and any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading with respect to all information contained in the registration statement or any other disclosure document that describes the separation or the distribution or the company and its subsidiaries or primarily relates to the transactions contemplated by the separation and distribution agreement subject to certain exceptions if we are required to indemnify agilent under the circumstances set forth in the separation and distribution agreement we may be subject to substantial liabilities 

in connection with our separation from agilent agilent will indemnify us for certain liabilities however there can be no assurance that the indemnity will be sufficient to insure us against the full amount of such liabilities or that agilents ability to satisfy its indemnification obligation will not be impaired in the future 

pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement and certain other agreements with agilent agilent agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities however third parties could also seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that agilent has agreed to retain and there can be no assurance that the indemnity from agilent will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities or that agilent will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations in addition agilents insurers may attempt to deny us coverage for liabilities associated with certain occurrences of indemnified liabilities prior to the separation moreover even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from agilent or such insurance providers any amounts for which we are held liable we may be temporarily required to bear these losses each of these risks could negatively affect our business financial position results of operations and cash flows 

we will be subject to continuing contingent liabilities of agilent following the separation 

after the separation there will be several significant areas where the liabilities of agilent may become our obligations for example under the code and the related rules and regulations each corporation that was a member of the agilent us consolidated group during a taxable period or portion of a taxable period ending on or before the effective time of the distribution is severally liable for the us federal income tax liability of the entire agilent us consolidated group for that taxable period consequently if agilent is unable to pay the consolidated us federal income tax liability for a prior period we could be required to pay the entire amount of such tax which could be substantial and in excess of the amount allocated to it under the tax matters agreement between us and agilent other provisions of federal law establish similar liability for other matters including laws governing taxqualified pension plans as well as other contingent liabilities 

there could be significant liability if the distribution is determined to be a taxable transaction 

a condition to the distribution is that agilent received an opinion of baker  mckenzie llp tax counsel to agilent regarding the qualification of the separation and the distribution as a reorganization within the meaning of sections 355a and 368a1d of the code the opinion relies on certain facts assumptions representations and undertakings from agilent and keysight including those regarding the past and future conduct of the companies respective businesses and other matters if any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings are incorrect or not satisfied agilent and its shareholders may not be able to rely on the opinion and could be subject to significant tax liabilities notwithstanding the opinion of tax counsel the irs could determine on audit that the distribution is taxable if it determines that any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion 

if the distribution were determined to be taxable for us federal income tax purposes agilent and its shareholders that are subject to us federal income tax could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities for example if the distribution failed to qualify for taxfree treatment agilent would for us federal income tax purposes be treated as if it had sold the keysight common stock in a taxable sale for its fair market value and agilents shareholders who are subject to us federal income tax would be treated as receiving a taxable distribution in an amount equal to the fair market value of the keysight common stock received in the distribution in addition if the separation and distribution failed to qualify for taxfree treatment under federal state and local tax law andor foreign tax law agilent and under the tax matters agreement described below keysight could incur significant tax liabilities under us federal state local andor foreign tax law 

under the tax matters agreement between agilent and keysight we are generally required to indemnify agilent against taxes incurred by agilent that arise as a result of our taking or failing to take as the case may be certain actions that result in the distribution failing to meet the requirements of a taxfree distribution under section 355 of the code under the tax matters agreement between agilent and keysight we may also be required to indemnify agilent for other contingent tax liabilities which could materially adversely affect our financial position 

  

we may not be able to engage in certain corporate transactions for a twoyear period after the separation 

to preserve the taxfree treatment for us federal income tax purposes to agilent of the separation and distribution under the tax matters agreement that we have entered into with agilent we will be restricted from taking any action that prevents the separation and distribution from being taxfree for us federal income tax purposes under the tax matters agreement for the twoyear period following the distribution we are prohibited except in certain circumstances from entering into acquisition merger liquidation sale and stock redemption transactions with respect to our stock if such transactions taken as a whole would result in one or more persons acquiring forty percent 40 or more of the outstanding keysight stock 

these restrictions may limit our ability to pursue certain strategic transactions or other transactions that it may believe to be in the best interests of our shareholders or that might increase the value of our business in addition under the tax matters agreement we may be required to indemnify agilent against any such tax liabilities as a result of the acquisition of keysights stock or assets even if we did not participate in or otherwise facilitate the acquisition 

our accounting and other management systems and resources may not be adequately prepared to meet the financial reporting and other requirements to which we are subject as an independent publiclytraded company 

our financial results previously were included within the consolidated results of agilent and we believe that our financial reporting and internal controls were appropriate for those of subsidiaries of a public company however we were not directly subject to the reporting and other requirements of the exchange act as an independent publiclytraded company we are subject to reporting and other obligations under the exchange act and we are required to comply with section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 the “sarbanesoxley act” which will require annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting the sarbanesoxley act also requires that we obtain a report by our independent registered public accounting firm expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting these reporting and other obligations may place significant demands on our management administrative and operational resources including accounting systems and resources 

the exchange act requires that we file annual quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition under the sarbanesoxley act we are required to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting we expect to incur additional annual expenses for the purpose of addressing these requirements and those expenses may be significant if we are unable to upgrade our financial and management controls reporting systems information technology systems and procedures in a timely and effective fashion our ability to comply with our financial reporting requirements and other rules that apply to reporting companies under the exchange act could be impaired any failure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

certain of our executive officers and directors may have actual or potential conflicts of interest because of their equity interest in agilent and because certain converted keysight performance share awards held by them will be earned based on the performance of agilent 

the ownership by our executive officers and some of our directors of common shares of agilent may create or may create the appearance of conflicts of interest because of their current or former positions with agilent certain of our executive officers and directors own agilent common shares the individual holdings of common shares may be significant for some of these persons compared to these persons total assets further the fact that our executive officers hold certain converted keysight performance share awards which will be earned based on agilents performance may create or may create the appearance of conflicts of interest specifically the outstanding agilent performance share awards with a fiscal year 20132015 performance period held by our executive officers were converted into performance share awards with respect to keysight common stock upon the separation but will continue to be subject for the remainder of the performance period to the same performance criteria agilent total shareholder return as applied immediately prior to the separation even though our board of directors consist of a majority of directors who are independent and our executive officers ceased to be employees of agilent upon the separation continuing ownership of agilent common shares by our executive officers and some of our directors and continued application of performance criteria based on agilent total shareholder return to certain converted keysight performance share awards held by our executive officers could create or appear to create potential conflicts of interest if keysight and agilent pursue the same corporate opportunities or face decisions that could have different implications for keysight and agilent 

we may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of the separation and the separation may adversely affect our business 

we may not be able to achieve the full strategic and financial benefits expected to result from the separation or such benefits may be delayed or not occur at all the separation and distribution is expected to provide the following benefits among others 

 21 

  

 we may not achieve these and other anticipated benefits for a variety of reasons including among others i the separation will require significant amounts of managements time and effort which may divert managements attention from operating and growing our business ii following the separation we may be more susceptible to market fluctuations and other adverse events than if we were still a part of agilent iii following the separation our business will be less diversified and have less scale than agilents business prior to the separation and iv the other actions required to separate agilents and our respective businesses could disrupt our operations if we fail to achieve some or all of the benefits expected to result from the separation or if such benefits are delayed our business operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 

keysight or agilent may fail to perform under various transaction agreements that have been executed as part of the separation or we may fail to have necessary systems and services in place when certain of the transaction agreements expire 

in connection with the separation keysight and agilent have entered into a separation agreement and various other agreements including a services agreement a tax matters agreement an employee matters agreement an intellectual property matters agreement a trademark license agreement and a real estate matters agreement the separation agreement tax matters agreement employee matters agreement intellectual property matters agreement trademark license agreement and real estate matters agreement determine the allocation of assets and liabilities between the companies following the separation for those respective areas and include any necessary indemnifications related to liabilities and obligations the services agreement provides for the performance of certain services by each company for the benefit of the other for a period of time after the separation we will rely on agilent to satisfy its performance and payment obligations under these agreements if agilent is unable to satisfy its obligations under these agreements including its indemnification obligations we could incur operational difficulties or losses if we do not have in place our own systems and services or if we do not have agreements with other providers of these services once certain transaction agreements expire we may not be able to operate our business effectively and our profitability may decline we are in the process of creating our own or engaging third parties to provide systems and services to replace many of the systems and services that agilent currently provides to us however we may not be successful in implementing these systems and services or in transitioning data from agilents systems to our own 

as we build our information technology infrastructure and transition our data to our own systems we could incur substantial additional costs and experience temporary business interruptions 

we expect to install and implement information technology infrastructure to support our critical business functions including accounting and reporting manufacturing process control customer service inventory control and distribution we may incur temporary interruptions in business operations if we cannot transition effectively from agilent’s existing transactional and operational systems data centers and the transition services that support these functions as we replace these systems we may not be successful in implementing our new systems and transitioning our data and we may incur substantially higher costs for implementation than currently anticipated our failure to avoid operational interruptions as we implement the new systems and replace agilent’s information technology services or our failure to implement the new systems and replace agilent’s services successfully could disrupt our business adversely affect our ability to collect receivables from customers and have a material adverse effect on our profitability in addition if we are unable to replicate or transition certain systems our ability to comply with regulatory requirements could be impaired 

the onetime and ongoing costs of the spinoff may be greater than we expected 

we will incur costs in connection with our transition to being a standalone public company that relate primarily to accounting tax legal and other professional costs financing costs in connection with obtaining our financing as a standalone company compensation such as modifications to certain incentive awards upon completion of the spinoff recruiting and relocation costs associated with hiring our senior management personnel and costs to separate assets and information systems these costs whether incurred before or after the spinoff may be greater than anticipated and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

  

potential liabilities may arise due to fraudulent transfer considerations which would adversely affect our financial condition and our results of operations 

in connection with the separation and distribution agilent has undertaken and will undertake several corporate restructuring transactions which along with the separation and distribution may be subject to federal and state fraudulent conveyance and transfer laws if under these laws a court were to determine that at the time of the separation and distribution any entity involved in these restructuring transactions or the separation and distribution 

 then the court could void the separation and distribution in whole or in part as a fraudulent conveyance or transfer the court could then require our shareholders to return to agilent some or all of the shares of keysight common stock issued in the distribution or require agilent or keysight as the case may be to fund liabilities of the other company for the benefit of creditors the measure of insolvency will vary depending upon the jurisdiction whose law is being applied generally however an entity would be considered insolvent if the fair value of its assets was less than the amount of its liabilities or if it incurred debt beyond its ability to repay the debt as it matures 

risks related to our common stock 

our share price may fluctuate significantly 

our common stock is listed on nyse under the ticker symbol “keys” the market price of our common stock may fluctuate widely depending on many factors some of which may be beyond our control including 

 stock markets in general have experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company these broad market fluctuations could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 

in addition when the market price of a company’s shares drops significantly shareholders often institute securities class action lawsuits against the company a lawsuit against us could cause us to incur substantial costs and could divert the time and attention of management and other resources 

we cannot guarantee the payment of dividends on our common stock or the timing or amount of any such dividends 

we do not currently expect to pay dividends on our common stock the payment of any dividends in the future and the timing and amount thereof to our shareholders will fall within the discretion of our board of directors the boards decisions regarding the payment of dividends will depend on many factors such as our financial condition earnings capital requirements debt service obligations restrictive covenants in our debt industry practice legal requirements regulatory constraints and other factors that the board deems relevant we cannot guarantee that we will pay a dividend in the future or continue to pay any dividends if we commence paying dividends 

  

an individual shareholders percentage ownership in keysight may be diluted in the future 

in the future the percentage ownership in keysight may be diluted because of equity issuances for acquisitions capital market transactions or otherwise including equity awards that we will be granting to our directors officers and employees and purchases of our shares through our employee stock purchase plan our employees will have options to purchase shares of our common stock after the distribution as a result of conversion of their agilent stock options to keysight stock options our compensation committee has granted and will grant additional stock options or other stockbased awards to our employees and directors from time to time under our employee benefit plans such awards will have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

in addition our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue without the approval of our shareholders one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designation powers preferences and relative participating optional and other special rights including preferences over our common stock respecting dividends and distributions as our board of directors generally may determine the terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of our common stock for example we could grant the holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions similarly the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences that we could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the common stock 

certain provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and of delaware law may prevent or delay an acquisition of the company which could decrease the trading price of our common stock 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain and delaware law contains provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by making such practices or bids unacceptably expensive to the bidder and to encourage prospective acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover these provisions include among others 

 in addition because we have not chosen to be exempt from section 203 of the delaware general corporation law the dgcl this provision could also delay or prevent a change of control that some shareholders may favor section 203 provides that subject to limited exceptions persons that acquire or are affiliated with a person that acquires more than 15 of the outstanding voting stock of a delaware corporation an interested stockholder shall not engage in any business combination with that corporation including by merger consolidation or acquisitions of additional shares for a threeyear period following the date on which the person became an interested stockholder unless i prior to such time the board of directors of such corporation approved either the business combination or the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder ii upon consummation of the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder the interested stockholder owned at least 85 of the voting stock of such corporation at the time the transaction commenced excluding for purposes of determining the voting stock outstanding but not the outstanding voting stock owned by the interested stockholder the voting stock owned by directors who are also officers or held in employee benefit plans in which the employees do not have a confidential right to tender or vote stock held by the plan or iii on or subsequent to such time the business combination is approved by the 

  

board of directors of such corporation and authorized at a meeting of shareholders by the affirmative vote of at least twothirds of the outstanding voting stock of such corporation not owned by the interested stockholder 

we believe these provisions will protect our shareholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors and by providing our board of directors with more time to assess any acquisition proposal these provisions are not intended to make us immune from takeovers however these provisions will apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some shareholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that our board of directors determines is not in the best interests of the company and our shareholders these provisions may also prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors 

in addition an acquisition or further issuance of our stock could trigger the application of section 355e of the code under the tax matters agreement we would be required to indemnify agilent for the resulting tax and this indemnity obligation might discourage delay or prevent a change of control that some shareholders may consider favorable 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates that the state courts in the state of delaware or if no state court located within the state of delaware has jurisdiction the federal court for the district of delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our shareholders which could discourage lawsuits against the company and our directors and officers 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provide that unless the board of directors otherwise determines the state courts in the state of delaware or if no state court located within the state of delaware has jurisdiction the federal court for the district of delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors or officers to the company or our shareholders any action asserting a claim against us or any of our directors or officers arising pursuant to any provision of the dgcl or keysights amended and restated certificate of incorporation or bylaws or any action asserting a claim against us or any of our directors or officers governed by the internal affairs doctrine this exclusive forum provision may limit the ability of our shareholders to bring a claim in a judicial forum that such shareholders find favorable for disputes with us or our directors or officers which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors and officers 

if securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or publish negative reports about our business our share price and trading volume could decline 

the trading market for our common stock depends to some extent on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us and our business we do not have any control over these analysts and the reports they issue if our financial performance fails to meet analyst estimates or one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our shares or negatively change their opinion of our shares our share price would likely decline if one or more analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us we could lose visibility in the financial markets which could cause our share price or trading volume to decline

basis of presentation and separation from agilent 

on november 1 2014 keysight technologies inc “we” our “keysight” or the company” became an independent publiclytraded company through the distribution by agilent technologies inc agilent of 100 percent of the outstanding common stock of keysight to agilents shareholders the separation each agilent shareholder of record as of the close of business on october 22 2014 received one share of keysight common stock for every two shares of agilent common stock held on the record date keysight was incorporated in delaware on december 6 2013 and is comprised of agilents former electronic measurement business keysights registration statement on form 10 was declared effective by the us securities and exchange commission on october 6 2014 keysights common stock began trading regularway under the ticker symbol keys on the new york stock exchange on november 3 2014 

our fiscal year end is october 31 and our fiscal quarters end on january 31 april 30 and july 31 unless otherwise stated all dates refer to our fiscal year and fiscal periods 

prior to the distribution agilent transferred substantially all of the assets and liabilities and operations of the electronic measurement business to keysight in august 2014 the capitalization combined f inancial statements prior to the capitalization were prepared on a standalone basis and were derived from agilent’s consolidated financial statements and accounting records the combined financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k reflect our financial position results of operations comprehensive income and cash flows as our business was operated as part of agilent prior to the capitalization following the capitalization the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company and our whollyowned subsidiaries all periods have been accounted for in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles 

for periods prior to the capitalization the combined and consolidated financial statements included the allocation of certain assets and liabilities that were historically held at the agilent level but which were specifically identified or allocated to us cash and cash equivalents held by agilent were not allocated to us agilent’s debt and related interest expense were not allocated to us since we are not the legal obligor of the debt and agilent’s borrowings were not directly attributable to us in addition prior to the capitalization all intercompany transactions between us and agilent were considered to be effectively settled at the time the transactions were recorded all cash generated by our business was assumed to be remitted to the agilent subsidiary located in the same legal entity or country the total net effect of the settlement of these intercompany transactions prior to the capitalization is reflected in the combined and consolidated statement of cash flows as a financing activity and in the combined and consolidated balance sheet as agilent net investment 

on october 15 2014 we issued 500 million of 330 percent senior notes due in 2019 and 600 million of 455 percent senior notes due in 2024 a portion of the proceeds from the offering was used to make a 900 million cash distribution to agilent in october 2014 we intend to use the remaining proceeds to fund working capital and other liquidity needs 

the combined and consolidated statement of operations includes our direct expenses for cost of products and services sold research and development sales and marketing distribution and administration as well as allocations of expenses arising from shared services and infrastructure provided by agilent to us these allocated expenses include costs of information technology accounting and legal services real estate and facilities corporate advertising insurance services treasury and other corporate and infrastructure services in addition other costs allocated to us include restructuring costs sharebased compensation expense and 

  

retirement plan expenses related to agilent’s corporate and shared services employees these expenses are allocated to us using estimates that we consider to be a reasonable reflection of the utilization of services provided to or benefits received by us these costs have been allocated to us on the basis of direct usage when identifiable with the remainder allocated on a prorata basis of revenue square footage headcount or other measures 

we expect agilent to continue to provide some of these services related to these functions on a transitional basis for a fee which will be partially offset by other income from keysight services provided to agilent these services will be received or provided under a transition services agreement we do not expect the net costs associated with the transition services agreement to be materially different than the historical costs that have been allocated to us related to these same services 

we also expect to incur other incremental costs as an independent publicly traded company as compared to the costs historically allocated to us by agilent these incremental costs are estimated to be approximately 20 million on an annual pretax basis for the fiscal year 2014 we recognized 78 million of nonrecurring transaction and preseparation costs we expect to recognize additional nonrecurring transaction and separation costs which are currently estimated to range from 25 million to 30 million through fiscal 2016 these costs are expected to include among other things branding legal accounting and other advisory fees and other costs to separate and transition from agilent

total orders in 2014 were 2963 million an increase of 3 percent when compared to 2013 orders increased in all market segments including aerospace and defense industrial computer and semiconductor test and communications test foreign currency movements had an unfavorable impact of 1 percentage point on the year‑over‑year comparison orders of 2866 million in 2013 declined 13 percent when compared to 2012 on declines in all market segments including aerospace and defense industrial computer and semiconductor test and communications test 

net revenue of 2933 million in 2014 increased 2 percent when compared to 2013 with industrial computer and semiconductor test contributing 2 percentage points of the increase and communication test contributing 1 percentage point of the increase partially offset by a decline in aerospace and defense revenue foreign currency movements had an unfavorable impact of 1 percentage point on the year over year comparison net revenue of 2888 million in 2013 declined 13 percent when compared to 2012 with lower communications test revenue contributing 8 percentage points of the decline and lower industrial computer and semiconductor test revenue further decreasing revenue by approximately 5 percentage points while aerospace and defense was flat year over year 

net income was 392 million in 2014 compared to net income of 457 million in 2013 and 841 million in 2012 in 2014 2013 and 2012 we generated operating cash flows of 563 million 566 million and 724 million respectively 

 looking forward while we believe the longterm growth rate of our markets is 3 to 4 percent we expect lower fiscal 2015 market growth in the range of 25 to 35 percent as an independent publiclytraded company we are focused on growing in our markets while meeting our financial commitments we intend to leverage our unique formula of hardware plus software plus people to create value for our customers and shareholders 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our combined and consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable although these estimates are based on managements best knowledge of current events and actions that may impact the company in the future actual results may be different from the estimates an accounting policy 

  

is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur could materially change the financial statements our critical accounting policies are those that affect our financial statements materially and involve difficult subjective or complex judgments by management those policies are revenue recognition inventory valuation allocation methods and allocated expenses from agilent sharebased compensation retirement and postretirement plan assumptions valuation of goodwill and purchased intangible assets restructuring and accounting for income taxes 

revenue recognition we enter into agreements to sell products hardware andor software services and other arrangements multipleelement arrangements that include combinations of products and services revenue from product sales net of trade discounts and allowances is recognized provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured delivery is considered to have occurred when title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer for products or when the service has been provided revenue is reduced for estimated product returns when appropriate for sales that include customerspecified acceptance criteria revenue is recognized after the acceptance criteria have been met for products that include installation if the installation meets the criteria to be considered a separate element product revenue is recognized upon delivery and recognition of installation revenue occurs when the installation is complete otherwise neither the product nor the installation revenue is recognized until the installation is complete revenue from services is deferred and recognized over the contractual period or as services are rendered and accepted by the customer we allocate revenue to each element in our multipleelement arrangements based upon their relative selling prices we determine the selling price for each deliverable based on a selling price hierarchy the selling price for a deliverable is based on our vendor specific objective evidence vsoe if available thirdparty evidence tpe if vsoe is not available or estimated selling price esp if neither vsoe nor tpe is available revenue from the sale of software products that are not required to deliver the tangible products essential functionality are accounted for under software revenue recognition rules revenue allocated to each element is then recognized when the basic revenue recognition criteria for that element have been met the amount of product revenue recognized is affected by our judgments as to whether an arrangement includes multiple elements 

we use vsoe of selling price in the selling price allocation in all instances where it exists vsoe of selling price for products and services is determined when a substantial majority of the selling prices fall within a reasonable range when sold separately tpe of selling price can be established by evaluating largely interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone sales to similarly situated customers as our products contain a significant element of proprietary technology and the solution offered differs substantially from that of competitors it is difficult to obtain the reliable standalone competitive pricing necessary to establish tpe esp represents the best estimate of the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a standalone basis we determine esp for a product or service by using historical selling prices which reflect multiple factors including but not limited to customer type geography market conditions competitive landscape gross margin objectives and pricing practices the determination of esp is made through consultation with and approval by management we may modify or develop new pricing practices and strategies in the future as these pricing strategies evolve changes may occur in esp the aforementioned factors may result in a different allocation of revenue to the deliverables in multipleelement arrangements which may change the pattern and timing of revenue recognition for these elements but will not change the total revenue recognized for the arrangement 

inventory valuation we assess the valuation of our inventory on a periodic basis and make adjustments to the value for estimated excess and obsolete inventory based upon estimates about future demand and actual usage such estimates are difficult to make under most economic conditions the excess balance determined by this analysis becomes the basis for our excess inventory charge our excess inventory review process includes analysis of sales forecasts managing product rollovers and working with manufacturing to maximize recovery of excess inventory if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management additional writedowns may be required if actual market conditions are more favorable than anticipated inventory previously written down may be sold to customers resulting in lower cost of sales and higher income from operations than expected in that period 

allocations agilent allocated certain costs such as sharebased compensation expense and retirement and postretirement benefit plan expense relating to our employees and agilents corporate and shared services employees these expenses were subject to certain underlying assumptions mentioned below 

sharebased compensation prior to the separation keysight employees participated in agilent’s stock program sharebased compensation expense has been allocated to us based on keysight employees participating in agilents stock plan and our share of agilents corporate and shared services employee costs based on our share of revenue agilent accounts for sharebased awards in accordance with the authoritative guidance where sharebased compensation expense is primarily based on estimated grant date fair value and is recognized on a straightline basis the fair value of sharebased awards for employee stock option awards was estimated using the blackscholes option pricing model shares granted under the longterm performance ltp program were valued using the monte carlo simulation model the estimated fair value of restricted stock unit awards is determined 

  

based on the market price of agilents common stock on the date of grant adjusted for expected dividend yield the employee stock purchase plan espp allows eligible employees to purchase shares of agilents common stock at 85 percent of the purchase price and uses the purchase date to establish the fair market value both the blackscholes and monte carlo simulation fairvalue models require the use of highly subjective and complex assumptions used by agilent including the options expected life and the price volatility of agilent stock the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of sharebased awards represent agilents best estimates but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment although we believe the assumptions and estimates made are reasonable and appropriate changes in assumptions could materially impact our reported financial results 

retirement and postretirement benefit plan assumptions   prior to the capitalization substantially all of our employees were covered under various defined benefit andor defined contribution retirement plans sponsored by agilent we have accounted for our employee participation in agilent’s defined benefit retirement plans and the post‑retirement health care plan as multiemployer plans as a result no asset or liability was recorded by us to recognize the funded status of such plans in our combined and consolidated balance sheet prior to the capitalization at the capitalization the assets and liabilities of these plans that were allocable to keysight employees were transferred to keysight plans therefore the plans are no longer considered multiemployer plans 

our combined and consolidated statements of operations include expense that has been allocated to us based on keysight employees participating in these plans and our share of agilents corporate and shared services employee costs we consider the expense allocation methodology and results to be reasonable for all periods presented at capitalization we established defined benefit retirement and postretirement plans for our current and former employees the defined benefit retirement and post retirement obligations relating to those participants in these plans were transferred from agilent’s plans to our defined benefit plans a proportionate share of the defined benefit plan assets was allocated from the agilent pension trust in each applicable country to a newly established keysight pension trust subject to local law it is anticipated that the share of assets allocated to us will be in the same proportion as the projected benefit obligation of our participants to the total projected benefit obligation of agilent 

retirement and postretirement benefit plan costs are a significant cost of doing business they represent obligations that will ultimately be settled sometime in the future and therefore are subject to estimation pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the employees average expected future service to keysight based on the terms of the plans and investment and funding decisions to estimate the impact of these future payments and our decisions concerning funding of these obligations we are required to make assumptions using actuarial concepts within the framework of accounting principles generally accepted in the us two critical assumptions are the discount rate and the expected longterm return on plan assets other important assumptions include expected future salary increases expected future increases to benefit payments expected retirement dates employee turnover retiree mortality rates and investment portfolio composition we evaluate these assumptions at least annually 

the discount rate is used to determine the present value of future benefit payments at the measurement date which is october 31 for both us and nonus plans for 2014 the us discount rates were based on the results of matching expected plan benefit payments with cash flows from a hypothetically constructed bond portfolio for 2014 the discount rate for nonus plans was generally based on published rates for highquality corporate bonds if we changed our discount rate by 1 percent the impact would be 4 million on us net periodic benefit cost and 12 million on nonus net periodic benefit cost lower discount rates increase the present value of the liability and subsequent year pension expense higher discount rates decrease the present value of the liability and subsequent year pension expense 

the company uses alternate methods of amortization as allowed by the authoritative guidance that amortizes the actuarial gains and losses on a consistent basis for the years presented for us plans gains and losses are amortized over the average future working lifetime for most nonus plans and us postretirement benefit plans gains and losses are amortized using a separate layer for each years gains and losses the expected longterm return on plan assets is estimated using current and expected asset allocations as well as historical and expected returns plan assets are valued at fair value if we changed our estimated return on assets by 1 percent the impact would be 7 million on us net periodic benefit cost and 13 million on nonus net periodic benefit cost 

goodwill and other intangible assets   we review goodwill for impairment annually during our fourth fiscal quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable as defined in the authoritative guidance a reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment we aggregated components of an operating segment that have similar economic characteristics into our reporting units at the time of an acquisition we assign goodwill to the reporting unit that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination 

companies have the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether performing the twostep quantitative 

  

test is necessary if an entity believes as a result of its qualitative assessment that it is morelikelythannot ie  50 chance that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount the quantitative impairment test will be required otherwise no further testing will be required 

the guidance includes examples of events and circumstances that might indicate that a reporting units fair value is less than its carrying amount these examples include macroeconomic conditions such as deterioration in the entitys operating environment or industry or market considerations entityspecific events such as increasing costs declining financial performance or loss of key personnel or other events such as an expectation that a reporting unit will be sold or a sustained decrease in the stock price on either an absolute basis or relative to peers the qualitative indicators replace those previously used to determine whether an interim goodwill impairment test is required if it is determined as a result of the qualitative assessment that it is morelikelythannot that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount the provisions of authoritative guidance require that we perform a twostep impairment test on goodwill in the first step we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value the second step if necessary measures the amount of impairment by applying fairvaluebased tests to the individual assets and liabilities within each reporting unit 

historically we conducted our business in a single operating segment and reporting unit in fiscal 2014 in conjunction with the planned separation we implemented changes in our organizational structure which resulted in the formation of two reportable operating segments in fiscal year 2014 we assessed goodwill impairment for our two reporting units which consisted of our two segments measurement solutions and customer support and services we performed a quantitative test of goodwill impairment for both reporting units as of september 30 2014 based on the results of our testing the fair value for both reporting units was significantly in excess of the carrying value there was no impairment of goodwill during the years ended october 31 2014 2013 and 2012 each quarter we review the events and circumstances to determine if goodwill impairment is indicated 

warranty our standard warranty term for most of our products from the date of delivery is typically three years which increased from one year in the second quarter of fiscal 2013 we accrue for standard warranty costs based on historical trends in warranty charges as a percentage of net product revenue the accrual is reviewed regularly and periodically adjusted to reflect changes in warranty cost estimates estimated warranty charges are recorded within cost of products at the time related product revenue is recognized 

we also sell extended warranties that provide warranty coverage beyond the standard warranty term revenue associated with extended warranties is deferred and recognized over the extended coverage period 

restructuring the main component of our restructuring plan is related to workforce reductions workforce reduction charges are accrued when payment of benefits becomes probable and the amounts can be estimated if the amounts and timing of cash flows from restructuring activities are significantly different from what we have estimated the actual amount of restructuring and other related charges could be materially different either higher or lower than those we have recorded 

accounting for income taxes we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits benefits and deductions and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes as well as interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period 

significant management judgment is also required in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part when it is morelikelythannot that all or some portion of specific deferred tax assets such as net operating losses or foreign tax credit carryforwards will not be realized a valuation allowance must be established for the amount of the deferred tax assets that cannot be realized we consider all available positive and negative evidence on a jurisdictionbyjurisdiction basis when assessing whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable we consider evidence such as our past operating results the existence of losses in recent years and our forecast of future taxable income in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 we released the valuation allowance for the majority of our us deferred tax assets at october 31 2014 we continue to maintain a valuation allowance for certain us state and foreign deferred tax assets we intend to maintain a valuation allowance in these jurisdictions until sufficient positive evidence exists to support its reversal 

we have not provided for all us federal income and foreign withholding taxes on the undistributed earnings of some of our foreign subsidiaries because we intend to reinvest such earnings permanently should we decide to remit this income to the us in a future period our provision for income taxes will increase materially in that period 

the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax law and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions although the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes the use of a recognition and measurement model the determination of whether an uncertain tax position has met those thresholds will continue to require significant judgment by management in accordance with the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income 

  

taxes for all us and other tax jurisdictions we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes and interest will be due the ultimate resolution of tax uncertainties may differ from what is currently estimated which could result in a material impact on income tax expense if our estimate of income tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment a further charge to expense would be required if events occur and the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary we include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes in the combined and consolidated statements of operations 

we have calculated our taxes on a separate return basis however the amounts recorded are not necessarily representative of the amounts that would have been reflected in the financial statements had we been an entity that operated independently of agilent it is possible that we will make different tax accounting elections and assertions such as the amount of earnings that will be permanently reinvested outside the us following our distribution from agilent consequently our future results after our separation from agilent may be materially different from our historical results 

adoption of new pronouncements 

see note 2 new accounting pronouncements to the combined and consolidated financial statements for a description of new accounting pronouncements 

restructuring 

in fiscal 2013 we recognized 15 million of restructuring charges associated with the targeted headcount reduction of approximately 200 regular employees representing approximately 2 percent of our global workforce through the end of fiscal 2014 approximately 11 million was paid out under this program for the termination of 145 employees and 3 million of accrual has been reversed related to 40 employees who have been redeployed within the company as of october 31 2014 we have a remaining accrual of 1 million and have substantially completed this program 

foreign currency 

our revenues costs and expenses and monetary assets and liabilities are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our global operating and financing activities we hedge revenues expenses and balance sheet exposures that are not denominated in the functional currencies of our subsidiaries on a shortterm and anticipated basis on our behalf the result of the hedging has been included in our combined and consolidated statement of operations we do experience some fluctuations within individual lines of the combined and consolidated balance sheet and statement of operations because our hedging program is not designed to offset the currency movements in each category of revenues expenses monetary assets and liabilities our hedging program is designed to hedge currency movements on a relatively shortterm basis up to a rolling twelve month period therefore we are exposed to currency fluctuations over the longer term to the extent that we are required to pay for all or portions of an acquisition price in foreign currencies we may enter into foreign exchange contracts to reduce the risk that currency movements will impact the us dollar cost of the transaction 

prior to the capitalization we were under agilents hedging program and none of the financial instruments used in agilents hedging program were included in our combined and consolidated balance sheet 

results from operationsyears ended october 31 2014 2013 and 2012 

orders and net revenue 

in general recorded orders represent firm purchase commitments from our customers with established terms and conditions for products and services that will be delivered within six months revenue reflects the delivery and acceptance of the products and services as defined on the customer’s terms and conditions cancellations are recorded in the period received from the customer and historically have not been material 

  





total orders increased 3 percent in 2014 compared to 2013 orders increased in all market segments including aerospace and defense industrial computer and semiconductor test and communications test foreign currency movements had an unfavorable impact of 1 percentage point on the yearoveryear compare our orders declined 13 percent in 2013 compared to 2012 orders were lower for all market segments including aerospace and defense industrial computer and semiconductor test and communications test 

net revenue of 2933 million for 2014 increased 2 percent as compared to 2013 with modest growth in industrial computer and semiconductor test contributing 2 percentage points of the increase and communication test contributing 1 percentage point of the increase partially offset by a decline in aerospace and defense revenue foreign currency movements had an unfavorable impact of 1 percentage point on the yearoveryear compare revenue from asia pacific excluding japan grew 8 percent driven by growth in communication test and industrials computer and semiconductor test europe revenue increased 5 percent yearoveryear from growth in communications test americas revenues declined 3 percent yearoveryear with lower aerospace and defense and communications test japan revenues declined 9 percent yearoveryear with declines in all market segments revenue from products increased 2 percent in 2014 compared to 2013 while service related revenue was flat revenue declined 13 percent in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to lower wireless manufacturing and industrial computer and semiconductor test demand 

communications test revenue representing approximately 34 percent of our total revenue increased yearoveryear with increases in wireless manufacturing and broadband communications business partially offset by modest declines in wireless rd wireless manufacturing growth continues to be driven by 4g base station investments mainly for china broadband showed solid growth impacted by demand for datacom bandwidth wireless rd continues to be affected by cautious customer spending driven by consolidation and restructuring activities throughout the industry across device network equipment chipset and component manufacturers in 2013 communications test revenue declined compared to 2012 due to significantly lower wireless manufacturing demand and modest declines in wireless rd 

aerospace and defense business representing approximately 22 percent of our total revenue decreased compared to 2013 with declines in all regions however we saw positive growth in the last half of fiscal 2014 in 2013 aerospace and defense test representing approximately 23 percent of total revenue was flat compared to 2012 with lower demand in the americas offset by stronger spending in europe 

industrial computer and semiconductor test revenue representing approximately 44 percent of total business increased yearoveryear compared to 2013 the computer and semiconductor increase was driven by investment in capacity growth and the overall strength in the semiconductor market the industrial test business grew for the year with particular strength in the last fiscal quarter driven by growth in the americas and asia pacific excluding japan in 2012 industrial computer and semiconductor test represented approximately 43 percent of the total business with slight growth in computer and semiconductor business 

  

backlog 

backlog represents the amount of revenue expected from orders that have already been booked including orders for goods and services that have not been delivered to customers orders invoiced but not yet recognized as revenue and orders for goods that were shipped but not invoiced awaiting acceptance by customers 

at october 31 2014 our unfilled backlog was approximately 781 million as compared to approximately 761 million at october 31 2013 for the measurement solutions business our unfilled backlog was approximately 627 million at october 31 2014 as compared to approximately 563 million at october 31 2013 within our customer services and support business our unfilled backlog was approximately 154 million at october 31 2014 as compared to approximately 198 million at october 31 2013 the reduction in the customer services and support business backlog in fiscal 2014 was primarily due to a change in our standard warranty term which increased from one to three years for most of our products in the second quarter of fiscal 2013 revenue associated with extended warranties which provide coverage beyond the standard warranty term is deferred and amortized over the extended period of coverage as a result of the extension of the standard warranty term backlog associated with extended warranties has declined three year warranty is now included as part of the total solution and the value is captured as part of the system sale 

we expect that a majority of the unfilled backlog will be recognized as revenue within six months on average our unfilled backlog represents approximately three months worth of revenue we believe backlog on any particular date while indicative of shortterm revenue performance is not necessarily a reliable indicator of medium or longterm revenue performance 

costs and expenses 





gross margin declined 1 percentage point in 2014 compared to 2013 on slightly higher revenue higher inventory charges and pricing pressure in the wireless manufacturing market were the primary reasons for the lower gross margin gross margin declined 1 percentage point in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to lower sales volume while declines in variable and incentive pay and reduced infrastructure spending were offset by higher excess and obsolete inventory charges wage increases acquisition and integration costs and restructuring expenses 

excess and obsolete inventory charges were 33 million in 2014 21 million in 2013 and 14 million in 2012 sales of previously writtendown inventory were 1 million in each of 2014 2013 and 2012 

research and development expenses declined 4 percent in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to lower infrastructurerelated expenses research and development expenses declined 1 percent in 2013 compared to 2012 reductions in development spending variable and incentive pay and infrastructurerelated expenses and the favorable impact of currency movements were partially offset by investments in acquisitions and wage increases 

selling general and administrative expenses increased 5 percent in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to higher costs related to nonrecurring preseparation transaction costs and an increase in marketing expenses partially offset by reductions in infrastructure costs and the favorable impact of currency movements    selling general and administrative expenses decreased 2 percent in 2013 compared to 2012 reductions in discretionary spending lower variable and incentive pay and the favorable impact of currency movements were partially offset by wage increases 

operating margins declined 1 percentage point in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily driven by onetime separation costs operating margins declined by 5 percentage points in 2013 compared to 2012 on lower revenue partially offset by reduced operating expenses as of october 31 2014 our headcount was approximately 9600 

  

income taxes 



for 2014 the effective tax rate was 18 percent the 18 percent effective tax is lower than the us statutory rate primarily due to the mix of earnings in nonus jurisdictions taxed at lower statutory tax rates in particular singapore where we enjoyed tax holidays for the first three quarters of 2014 which resulted in a decrease to income tax expense of 40 million the current year rate was also favorably impacted by a 55 million benefit from a prior year reserve release which was offset by 62m tax expense as a result of the repatriation of foreign earnings 

for 2013 the effective tax rate was 9 percent the 9 percent effective tax is lower than the us statutory rate primarily due to the mix of earnings in nonus jurisdictions taxed at lower statutory tax rates in particular singapore where we enjoy tax holidays 

for 2012 the effective tax rate was 13 percent the 13 percent effective tax rate reflects tax on earnings in jurisdictions that have low effective tax rates and includes a 227 million tax benefit due to the reversal of a valuation allowance for our us federal deferred tax assets valuation allowances require an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when determining whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable such assessment is required on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis in the fourth quarter of 2012 management concluded that the valuation allowance for our us federal deferred tax assets is no longer needed primarily due to the emergence from cumulative losses in recent years the return to sustainable us operating profits and the expectation of sustainable profitability in future periods as of october 31 2012 the cumulative positive evidence outweighed the negative evidence regarding the likelihood that most of the deferred tax asset for our us combined income tax group will be realized accordingly we recognized a nonrecurring tax benefit of 227 million in 2012 relating to the valuation allowance reversal the effective tax rate also included a nonrecurring tax expense of 80 million relating to an increase in the overall residual tax expected to be imposed upon the repatriation of unremitted foreign earnings previously considered permanently reinvested during the fourth quarter of 2012 we assessed the forecasted cash needs and the overall financial position of our foreign subsidiaries and determined that a portion of previously permanently reinvested earnings would no longer be reinvested overseas 

we enjoyed tax holidays in several different jurisdictions most significantly in singapore through the third quarter of fiscal 2014 and several jurisdictions have granted or are anticipated to grant us tax incentives that require renewal at various times in the future most significant being in singapore the tax holidays provide lower rates of taxation on certain classes of income and require various thresholds of investments and employment or specific types of income in those jurisdictions the tax holidays are due for renewal between 2015 and 2023 as a result of the incentives the impact of the tax holidays decreased income taxes by 40 million 68 million and 96 million in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively 

in accordance with the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes for all us and other tax jurisdictions we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes and interest will be due if our estimate of income tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment a further charge to expense would be required if events occur and the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary we include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes in the combined and condensed statements of operations 

in the united states agilents tax years remain open back to the year 2008 for federal income tax purposes and the year 2000 for significant states on january 29 2014 agilent reached an agreement with the irs for the tax years 2006 through 2007 that in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 resulted in 55 million of tax benefit associated with the recognition of previously unrecognized us federal and state tax benefits and the reversal of the related interest accruals resulting from this agreement agilent’s us federal income tax returns for 2008 through 2011 are currently under audit by the irs in other major jurisdictions where we conduct business the tax years generally remain open back to the year 2003 with these jurisdictions and the united states it is reasonably possible that there could be significant changes to our unrecognized tax benefits in the next twelve months due to either the expiration of a statute of limitation or a tax audit settlement given the number of years and numerous matters that remain subject to examination in various tax jurisdictions management is unable to estimate the range of possible changes to the balance of our unrecognized tax benefits 

  

we have calculated our taxes on a separate return basis however the amounts recorded are not necessarily representative of the amounts that would have been reflected in the financial statements had we been an entity that operated independently of agilent consequently our future results after our separation from agilent may be materially different from our historical results 

segment overview 

we have two reportable operating segments measurement solutions and customer support and services the measurement solutions segment is primarily the hardware and associated software businesses serving the electronic measurement market the customer support and services segment provides repair and calibration of the hardware measurement solutions and the resale of used instrument equipment 

measurement solutions business 

our measurement solutions business provides electronic measurement instruments and systems with related software and software design tools that are used in the design development manufacture installation deployment and operation of electronics equipment we provide startup assistance consulting optimization and application support throughout the customer’s product lifecycle our electronic measurement solutions serve the following markets communications test aerospace and defense test and industrial computer and semiconductor test 

net revenue 



measurement solutions net revenue in 2014 increased 2 percent compared to 2013 with modest growth in industrial computer and semiconductor test contributing to 2 percentage points of the increase and communication test contributing 1 percentage point of the increase partially offset by a decline in aerospace and defense revenue measurement solutions net revenue in 2013 declined 15 percent compared to 2012 primarily on lower communications test and industrial computer and semiconductor test demand 

gross margin and operating margin 

the following table shows the measurement solutions business margins expenses and income from operations for 2014  versus 2013  and 2013  versus 2012  





gross margin in 2014 decreased 1 percentage point when compared to 2013 primarily due to higher inventory charges and and pricing pressure in the wireless manufacturing market gross margin in 2013 remained flat when compared to 2012 primarily due to the lower sales volume offset by the favorable impact of a lower proportion of wireless manufacturing business 

research and development expenses decreased 2 percent in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily driven by lower infrastructure costs research and development expenses decreased 3 percent in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily driven by reductions in variable and incentive pay discretionary spending and infrastructure related expenses we remain committed to invest in research and development and have focused our development efforts on key strategic opportunities in order to align our business with available markets 

selling general and administrative expenses decreased 2 percent in 2014 compared to 2013 decreases in infrastructure costs were partially offset by increases in marketing and discretionary spending selling general and administrative expenses decreased 

  

4 percent in 2013 compared to 2012 reductions in discretionary spending lower variable and incentive pay and favorable impact of currency movements were partially offset by wage increases 

operating margin increased by 1 percentage point in 2014 compared to 2013 on higher revenue and lower operating expenses operating margin decreased by 5 percentage points in 2013 compared to 2012 on lower revenue partially offset by reduced operating expenses 

income from operations 

income from operations in 2014 increased by 21 million or 5 percent on increased revenue of 40 million income from operations in 2013 decreased by 218 million or 33 percent on a revenue decrease of 449 million 

customer support and services business 

our customer support and services business provides repair and calibration services for our installed base measurement solutions customers and facilitates the resale of used equipment our customer support and services business enables our customers to maximize the value from their electronic measurement equipment and strengthen customer loyalty providing these services assures a high level of instrument performance and availability while minimizing the cost of ownership and downtime 

net revenue 



customer support and business net revenue in 2014 increased 1 percent compared to 2013 growth in calibration services and remarketing sales of used equipment was partially offset by declines in the equipment repair business due to a reduction in extended warranty revenue as a result of extension of the standard warranty term from one to three years as discussed previously under backlog customer support and services net revenue in 2013 increased 6 percent compared to 2012 on slightly higher repair and calibration services and stronger demand for remarketed equipment 

gross margin and operating margin 

the following table shows the customer support and services business margins expenses and income from operations for 2014  versus 2013  and 2013  versus 2012  





gross margins in 2014 decreased 2 percentage points compared to 2013 increased costs for extended warranty contracts and the service mix change with increased calibrations were the primary reasons for the lower gross margins gross margin in 2013 was flat compared to 2012 

research and development expenses for customer support and services represent the segment’s share of centralized investment research and development expenses were flat in 2014 compared to 2013 driven mainly by our continued investment in instrument products research and development expenses increased 20 percent in 2013 compared to 2012 due to an increase in centralized research and development allocations 

  

selling general and administrative expenses were flat in 2014 compared to 2013 selling general and administrative expenses were 3 percent lower in 2013 compared to 2012 reductions in discretionary spending lower variable and incentive pay and the favorable impact of currency movements were offset by wage increases 

operating margins decreased by 2 percentage points in 2014 compared to 2013 revenue growth was more than offset by the reductions in gross margins operating margin increased by 2 percentage points in 2013 compared to 2012 mainly due to favorable gross margin from higher revenue with slightly lower operating expenses 

income from operations 

income from operations in 2014 decreased by 6 million or 6 percent on a revenue increase of 5 million income from operations in 2013 increased by 11 million or 14 percent on a revenue increase of 22 million 

financial condition 

liquidity and capital resources 

historically agilent has provided financing cash management and other treasury services to us cash transferred to and from agilent has been recorded as intercompany payables and receivables which are reflected in agilent net investment in the accompanying historical combined and consolidated financial statements we believe our cash generated from operations and our ability to access capital markets and credit lines will satisfy for at least the next twelve months our liquidity requirements both globally and domestically including the following working capital needs capital expenditures business acquisitions contractual obligations commitments and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations 

although the cash generated in the us from future operations including any cash and nonpermanently invested earnings repatriated to the us is expected to cover our normal operating requirements and debt service requirements a substantial amount of additional cash could be required for other purposes such as the maturity of our current and future debt obligations any dividends that may be declared any future stock repurchase programs and any us acquisitions if in the future after our separation from agilent we encounter a significant need for liquidity domestically or at a particular location that it cannot fulfill through borrowings equity offerings or other internal or external sources we may determine that cash repatriations are necessary repatriation could result in additional material us federal and state income tax payments in future years such adverse consequences would occur for example if the transfer of cash into the us is taxed and no foreign tax credit is available to offset the us tax liability resulting in higher taxes these factors may cause us to have an overall tax rate higher than our tax rates have been in the past we utilize a variety of funding strategies in an effort to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed 

our financial position as of october 31 2014 consisted of cash and cash equivalents of 810 million as compared to zero as of october 31 2013 cash of approximately 74 million which amount is subject to final determination as provided in the separation and distribution agreement will be returned to agilent as of october 31 2014 approximately 598 million of our cash and cash equivalents is held outside of the us in our foreign subsidiaries

agilent contributed 15 million  on our behalf to our us multiemployer plans in each of 2014 2013 and 2012 agilent contributed 41 million 45 million and 30 million to our nonus multiemployer plans in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively there were no contributions to the us multiemployer postretirement health care plan for the years ended october 31 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively at the capitalization the assets and liabilities of these plans that were allocable to keysight employees were transferred to keysight plans therefore the plans are no longer considered multiemployer plans

off balance sheet arrangements and other 

we have contractual commitments for noncancellable operating leases see note 17 commitments and contingencies to our combined and consolidated financial statements for further information on our noncancellable operating leases 

our liquidity is affected by many factors some of which are based on normal ongoing operations of our business and some of which arise from fluctuations related to global economics and markets our cash balances are generated and held in many locations throughout the world local government regulations may restrict our ability to move cash balances to meet cash needs under certain circumstances we do not currently expect such regulations and restrictions to impact our ability to pay vendors and conduct operations throughout our global organization 

contractual commitments 

our cash flows from operations are dependent on a number of factors including fluctuations in our operating results accounts receivable collections inventory management and the timing of tax and other payments as a result the impact of contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be analyzed in conjunction with such factors 

  

the following table summarizes our total contractual obligations at october 31 2014 for operations and excludes amounts recorded in our combined and consolidated balance sheet in millions 



operating leases commitments under operating leases relate primarily to leasehold property see note 17 commitments and contingencies 

interest on senior notes we have contractual obligations for interest payments on our senior notes interest rates and payment dates are detailed above under longterm debt 

commitments to contract manufacturers and suppliers we purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products during the normal course of business we issue purchase orders with estimates of our requirements several months ahead of the delivery dates however our agreements with these suppliers usually provide us the option to cancel reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed typically purchase orders outstanding with delivery dates within 30 days are noncancellable therefore approximately 86 percent of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements are firm noncancellable and unconditional commitments we expect to fulfill most of our purchase commitments for inventory within one year 

in addition to the abovementioned commitments to contract manufacturers and suppliers we record a liability for firm noncancellable and unconditional purchase commitments for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with our policy relating to excess inventory as of october 31 2014 the liability for our excess firm noncancellable and unconditional purchase commitments was 5 million compared to 5 million as of october 31 2013 and 4 million as of october 31 2012 these amounts are included in other accrued liabilities in our combined and consolidated balance sheet 

retirement plans commitments under the retirement plans relate to expected contributions to be made to our nonus defined benefit plans and to our postretirement medical plans for the next year only contributions after next year are impractical to estimate 

other purchase commitments     other purchase commitments relate to contracts with professional services suppliers typically we can cancel these contracts within 90 days without penalties for those contracts that are not cancellable within 90 days without penalties we are disclosing the amounts we are obligated to pay to a supplier under each contract in that period before such contract can be canceled as of october 31 2014  our contractual obligations with these suppliers are approximately 33 million within the next fiscal year as compared to approximately 26 million as of october 31 2013 the increase is due to additional contracts associated with our preseparation expenditures and additional contracts put in place related to our operational separation from agilent on august 1 2014 

we had no material offbalance sheet arrangements as of october 31 2014 or october 31 2013 

on balance sheet arrangements  the following table summarizes our total contractual obligations recorded in our combined and consolidated balance sheet pertaining to our longterm debt as of october 31 2014 in millions 



other longterm liabilities include 82 million and 92 million of liabilities for uncertain tax positions as of october 31 2014 and october 31 2013 respectively we are unable to accurately predict when these amounts will be realized or released however it is reasonably possible that there could be significant changes to our unrecognized tax benefits in the next 12 months due to either the expiration of a statute of limitations or a tax audit settlement 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks inherent in our sales commitments anticipated sales and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries we hedge future cash flows denominated in currencies other than the functional currency using sales and expense forecasts up to twelve months in advance our exposure to exchange rate risks is managed on an enterprisewide basis this strategy utilizes derivative financial instruments including option and forward contracts to hedge certain foreign currency exposures with the intent of offsetting gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposures with gains and losses on the derivative contracts hedging them we do not currently and do not intend to utilize derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes 

our operations generate nonfunctional currency cash flows such as revenues third party vendor payments and intercompany payments in anticipation of these foreign currency cash flows and in view of volatility of the currency market we enter into such foreign exchange contracts as are described above to manage our currency risk approximately 74  percent of our revenues in 2014  75 percent of our revenues in 2013  and 76 percent of our revenues in 2012  were generated in us dollars 

we performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10 percent adverse movement in foreign exchange rates to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above as of october 31 2014  and 2013 the analysis indicated that these hypothetical market movements would not have a material effect on our combined and consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

we are also exposed to interest rate risk due to the mismatch between the interest expense we pay on our loans at fixed rates and the variable rates of interest we receive from cash cash equivalents and other shortterm investments we have issued longterm debt in us dollars at fixed interest rates based on the market conditions at the time of financing we believe that the fair value of our fixed rate debt changes when the underlying market rates of interest change and we may use interest rate swaps to modify such market risk 

we performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10 percent adverse movement in interest rates relating to the underlying fair value of our fixed rate debt as of october 31 2014   the sensitivity analyses indicated that a hypothetical 10 percent adverse movement in interest rates would result in an immaterial impact to the fair value of our fixed rate debt
